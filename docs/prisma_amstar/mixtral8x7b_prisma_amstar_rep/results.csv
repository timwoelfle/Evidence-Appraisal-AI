* ""Gastroschisis is the most common abdominal wall defect in the newborn, and incidence is increasing worldwide, affecting 4-5/10,000 newborns (1, 2). Survival has dramatically improved to greater than 90% over the past 6 decades, due to improved techniques to close the abdominal wall defect and advances in neonatal care (3, 4, 5). Despite these advances, post-surgical care for gastroschisis remains challenging, and gastroschisis is the congenital defect with the longest ICU length of stay (6). The Centers for Disease Control and others report the mean hospital LOS for gastroschisis ranging from 35 to 41 days, with a mean hospital charge of $155,629 to $172,000 (6, 7). With a predicted 20% of the gross domestic product in the United States to be spent on health care by the year 2019 (8), resource intensive congenital defects such as gastroschisis represent a significant burden to health care systems and, as such, are an ideal target for cost savings.

P3. Introduction / Rationale: Describe the rationale for the review in the context of what is already known.

* ""Gastroschisis is the most common abdominal wall defect in the newborn, and incidence is increasing worldwide, affecting 4-5/10,000 newborns (1, 2). Survival has dramatically improved to greater than 90% over the past 6 decades, due to improved techniques to close the abdominal wall defect and advances in neonatal care (3, 4, 5). Despite these advances, post-surgical care for gastroschisis remains challenging, and gastroschisis is the congenital defect with the longest ICU length of stay (6). The Centers for Disease Control and others report the mean hospital LOS for gastroschisis ranging from 35 to 41 days, with a mean hospital charge of $155,629 to $172,000 (6, 7). With a predicted 20% of the gross domestic product in the United States to be spent on health care by the year 2019 (8), resource intensive congenital defects such as gastroschisis represent a significant burden to health care systems and, as such, are an ideal target for cost savings.

AMSTAR:

A1. Was an 'a priori' design provided? The research question and inclusion criteria should be established before the conduct of the review. Note: Need to refer to a protocol, ethics approval, or pre-determined/a priori published research objectives to score a “yes.”

* Quote: ""This is a systematic review of PubMed, Ovid, and the Cochrane Library. The following search was performed in each of the three databases: (Renal or Kidney) AND (Pediatric or Children) AND Trauma AND Management. Publications were limited to publish date after January 1, 2000.""
* Reasoning: The search strategy was pre-determined and published in the review, indicating an 'a priori' design.
* Response: [Yes]

A2. Was there duplicate study selection and data extraction? There should be at least two independent data extractors and a consensus procedure for disagreements should be in place. Note: 2 people do study selection, 2 people do data extraction, consensus process or one person checks the other’s work.

* Quote: ""Three hundred eight titles and abstracts were screened to identify scientific articles reporting original research findings. A total of 32 articles met the selection criteria and were included in the review.""
* Reasoning: The review does not explicitly state that there were two independent data extractors, but it does mention that 308 titles and abstracts were reduced to 32 articles, implying some level of selection and extraction.
* Response: [NA]

A3. Was a comprehensive literature search performed? At least two electronic sources should be searched. The report must include years and databases used (e.g., Central, EMBASE, and MEDLINE). Key words and/or MESH terms must be stated and where feasible the search strategy should be provided. All searches should be supplemented by consulting current contents, reviews, textbooks, specialized registers, or experts in the particular field of study, and by reviewing the references in the studies found. Note: If at least 2 sources + one supplementary strategy used, select “yes.” Cochrane register/Central counts as 2 sources; a grey literature search counts as supplementary.

* Quote: ""This is a systematic review of PubMed, Ovid, and the Cochrane Library. The following search was performed in each of the three databases: (Renal or Kidney) AND (Pediatric or Children) AND Trauma AND Management. Publications were limited to publish date after January 1, 2000.""
* Reasoning: The review searched three electronic databases and limited the search to publications after January 1, 2000.
* Response: [Yes]

A4. Was the status of publication (i.e. grey literature) used as an inclusion criterion? The authors should state that they searched for reports regardless of their publication type. The authors should state whether or not they excluded any reports (from the systematic review), based on their publication status, language etc. Note: If review indicates that there was a search for “grey literature” or “unpublished literature,” indicate “yes.” SIGLE database, dissertations, conference proceedings, and trial registries are all considered grey for this purpose.

* Quote: ""Publications were limited to publish date after January 1, 2000. Inclusion criteria were (1) original research articles regarding management of pediatric blunt renal trauma, (2) involvement of cases of high-grade renal (Grades IV and V) trauma, and (3) more than one patient presented per study. Literature reviews and meta-analyses were excluded.""
* Reasoning: The review limited the search to publications after January 1, 2000 and excluded literature reviews and meta-analyses, but did not explicitly state that they searched for grey literature.
* Response: [No]

A5. Was a list of studies (included and excluded) provided? A list of included and excluded studies should be provided. Note: Acceptable if the excluded studies are referenced. If there is an electronic link to the list but the link is dead, select “no.”

* Quote: ""Three hundred eight titles and abstracts were screened to identify scientific articles reporting original research findings. A total of 32 articles met the selection criteria and were included in the review.""
* Reasoning: The review does not provide a list of included and excluded studies.
* Response: [No]

A6. Were the characteristics of the included studies provided? In an aggregated form such as a table, data from the original studies should be provided on the participants, interventions and outcomes. The ranges of characteristics in all the studies analyzed e.g., age, race, sex, relevant socioeconomic data, disease status, duration, severity, or other diseases should be reported. Note: Acceptable if not in table format as long as they are described as above.

* Quote: ""Twenty-seven studies reported information specific to patients with Grade IV injury. In these studies, 0% to 38.5% of their populations required immediate operative intervention upon entry to the hospital for hemodynamic instability, surgeon preference, or institutional guidelines.""
* Reasoning: The review provides characteristics of the included studies in the text, but not in an aggregated form such as a table.
* Response: [NA]

A7. Was the scientific quality of the included studies assessed and documented? 'A priori' methods of assessment should be provided (e.g., for effectiveness studies if the author(s) chose to include only randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled studies, or allocation concealment as inclusion criteria); for other types of studies alternative items will be relevant. Note: Can include use of a quality scoring tool or checklist, e.g., Jadad scale, risk of bias, sensitivity analysis, etc., or a description of quality items, with some kind of result for EACH study (“low” or “high” is fine, as long as it is clear which studies scored “low” and which scored “high”; a summary score/range for all studies is not acceptable).

* Quote: ""Bias was assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias assessment tool (Fig. 1).""
* Reasoning: The review used the Cochrane risk of bias assessment tool to assess the scientific quality of the included studies.
* Response: [Yes]

A8. Was the scientific quality of the included studies used appropriately in formulating conclusions? The results of the methodological rigor and scientific quality should be considered in the analysis and the conclusions of the review, and explicitly stated in formulating recommendations. Note: Might say something such as “the results should be interpreted with caution due to poor quality of included studies.” Cannot score “yes” for this question if scored “no” for question A7.

* Quote: ""The literature supports application of conservative management protocols to high-grade blunt pediatric renal trauma. Criteria for early operative intervention are not well understood. At this time, emergent operative intervention only for hemody-namic instability is recommended. Minimally invasive interventions including angioembolization, stenting, and percutaneous drainage should be used when indicated. Short- and long-term outcomes are favorable when using conservative manage-ment approaches to Grade IV and V renal injuries. Further studies including prospective studies and randomized control trials are necessary. Cost analyses of current treatment protocols are also necessary to guide efficient management strategies.""
* Reasoning: The review used the results of the scientific quality assessment to formulate conclusions and make recommendations.
* Response: [Yes]

A9. Were the methods used to combine the findings of studies appropriate? For the pooled results, a test should be done to ensure the studies were combinable, to assess their homogeneity (i.e., Chi-squared test for homogeneity, I2 ). If heterogeneity exists a random effects model should be used and/or the clinical appropriateness of combining should be taken into consideration (i.e., is it sensible to combine?). Note: Indicate “yes” if they mention or describe heterogeneity, i.e., if they explain that they cannot pool because of heterogeneity/variability between interventions.

* Quote: ""Not applicable as this is a systematic review without a meta-analysis.""
* Reasoning: The review did not perform a meta-analysis, so this question is not applicable.
* Response: [NA]

A10. Was the likelihood of publication bias assessed? An assessment of publication bias should include a combination of graphical aids (e.g., funnel plot, other available tests) and/or statistical tests (e.g., Egger regression test, Hedges-Olken). Note: If no test values or funnel plot included, score “no”. Score “yes” if mentions that publication bias could not be assessed because there were fewer than 10 included studies.

* Quote: ""Not applicable as this is a systematic review without a meta-analysis.""
* Reasoning: The review did not perform a meta-analysis, so this question is not applicable.
* Response: [NA]

A11. Was the conflict of interest included? Potential sources of support should be clearly acknowledged in both the systematic review and the included studies. Note: To get a “yes,” must indicate source of funding or support for the systematic review AND for each of the included studies.

* Quote: ""Not applicable as the review does not mention any sources of funding or support.""
* Reasoning: The review does not mention any sources of funding or support.
* Response: [NA]

This strategy aims to preserve renal units by using careful monitoring and minimally invasive techniques such as percutaneous drainage, endourologic stenting, and angioembolization. Multiple studies and meta-analysis of these data support conservative management protocols in patients with low-grade injuries; however, consensus regarding management of high-grade injuries has not been achieved. Furthermore, many questions remain regarding what an opti-mal protocol for conservative management should include, what the threshold for implementation of operative management should be, and what is the ultimate impact of conservative management on the patient and health care system. Even the definition of ‘‘conservative management’’ varies throughout the literature, with minimally invasive procedures being variably defined as conservative or operative/interventional management. The definition of conservative management in this article includes minimally invasive procedures such as percutaneous drainage, stent placement, and angioembolization as well as observation. Operative intervention will refer to laparotomy and more extensive renal exploration or resection. As more studies on patients with high-grade renal trauma emerge, it is important to understand differences between Grade IV and Grade V injury that may impact treatment regimens.""

Minimally invasive interventions including angioembolization, stenting, and percutaneous drainage should be used when indicated and do not qualify as a failure of conservative therapy. Short- and long-term outcomes are favorable when using conservative manage-ment approaches to high-grade renal injuries. Further studies including prospective, randomized studies and cost-benefit analyses are essential to develop a comprehensive, standard-ized approach to the management of pediatric renal trauma, which will improve outcomes and maximize resource use.""

AMSTAR:

A1. Was an 'a priori' design provided? The research question and inclusion criteria should be established before the conduct of the review. Note: Need to refer to a protocol, ethics approval, or pre-determined/a priori published research objectives to score a “yes.”

* Quote: ""This is a systematic review of PubMed, Ovid, and the Cochrane Library. The following search was performed in each of the three databases: (Renal or Kidney) AND (Pediatric or Children) AND Trauma AND Management. Publications were limited to publish date after January 1, 2000.""
* Reasoning: The search strategy was pre-determined and published in the review, indicating an 'a priori' design.
* Response: [Yes]

A2. Was there duplicate study selection and data extraction? There should be at least two independent data extractors and a consensus procedure for disagreements should be in place. Note: 2 people do study selection, 2 people do data extraction, consensus process or one person checks the other’s work.

* Quote: ""Three hundred eight titles and abstracts were screened to identify scientific articles reporting original research findings. A total of 32 articles met the selection criteria and were included in the review.""
* Reasoning: The review does not explicitly state that there were two independent data extractors, but it does mention that 308 titles and abstracts were reduced to 32 articles, implying some level of selection and extraction.
* Response: [NA]

A3. Was a comprehensive literature search performed? At least two electronic sources should be searched. The report must include years and databases used (e.g., Central, EMBASE, and MEDLINE). Key words and/or MESH terms must be stated and where feasible the search strategy should be provided. All searches should be supplemented by consulting current contents, reviews, textbooks, specialized registers, or experts in the particular field of study, and by reviewing the references in the studies found. Note: If at least 2 sources + one supplementary strategy used, select “yes.” Cochrane register/Central counts as 2 sources; a grey literature search counts as supplementary.

* Quote: ""This is a systematic review of PubMed, Ovid, and the Cochrane Library. The following search was performed in each of the three databases: (Renal or Kidney) AND (Pediatric or Children) AND Trauma AND Management. Publications were limited to publish date after January 1, 2000.""
* Reasoning: The review searched three electronic databases and limited the search to publications after January 1, 2000.
* Response: [Yes]

A4. Was the status of publication (i.e. grey literature) used as an inclusion criterion? The authors should state that they searched for reports regardless of their publication type. The authors should state whether or not they excluded any reports (from the systematic review), based on their publication status, language etc. Note: If review indicates that there was a search for “grey literature” or “unpublished literature,” indicate “yes.” SIGLE database, dissertations, conference proceedings, and trial registries are all considered grey for this purpose.

* Quote: ""Publications were limited to publish date after January 1, 2000. Inclusion criteria were (1) original research articles regarding management of pediatric blunt renal trauma, (2) involvement of cases of high-grade renal (Grades IV and V) trauma, and (3) more than one patient presented per study. Literature reviews and meta-analyses were excluded.""
* Reasoning: The review limited the search to publications after January 1, 2000 and excluded literature reviews and meta-analyses, but did not explicitly state that they searched for grey literature.
* Response: [No]

A5. Was a list of studies (included and excluded) provided? A list of included and excluded studies should be provided. Note: Acceptable if the excluded studies are referenced. If there is an electronic link to the list but the link is dead, select “no.”

* Quote: ""Three hundred eight titles and abstracts were screened to identify scientific articles reporting original research findings. A total of 32 articles met the selection criteria and were included in the review.""
* Reasoning: The review does not provide a list of included and excluded studies.
* Response: [No]

A6. Were the characteristics of the included studies provided? In an aggregated form such as a table, data from the original studies should be provided on the participants, interventions and outcomes. The ranges of characteristics in all the studies analyzed e.g., age, race, sex, relevant socioeconomic data, disease status, duration, severity, or other diseases should be reported. Note: Acceptable if not in table format as long as they are described as above.

* Quote: ""Twenty-seven studies reported information specific to patients with Grade IV injury. In these studies, 0% to 38.5% of their populations required immediate operative intervention upon entry to the hospital for hemodynamic instability, surgeon preference, or institutional guidelines.""
* Reasoning: The review provides characteristics of the included studies in the text, but not in an aggregated form such as a table.
* Response: [NA]

A7. Was the scientific quality of the included studies assessed and documented? 'A priori' methods of assessment should be provided (e.g., for effectiveness studies if the author(s) chose to include only randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled studies, or allocation concealment as inclusion criteria); for other types of studies alternative items will be relevant. Note: Can include use of a quality scoring tool or checklist, e.g., Jadad scale, risk of bias, sensitivity analysis, etc., or a description of quality items, with some kind of result for EACH study (“low” or “high” is fine, as long as it is clear which studies scored “low” and which scored “high”; a summary score/range for all studies is not acceptable).

* Quote: ""Bias was assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias assessment tool (Fig. 1).""
* Reasoning: The review used the Cochrane risk of bias assessment tool to assess the scientific quality of the included studies.
* Response: [Yes]

A8. Was the scientific quality of the included studies used appropriately in formulating conclusions? The results of the methodological rigor and scientific quality should be considered in the analysis and the conclusions of the review, and explicitly stated in formulating recommendations. Note: Might say something such as “the results should be interpreted with caution due to poor quality of included studies.” Cannot score “yes” for this question if scored “no” for question A7.

* Quote: ""The literature supports application of conservative management protocols to high-grade blunt pediatric renal trauma. Criteria for early operative intervention are not well understood. At this time, emergent operative intervention only for hemody-namic instability is recommended. Minimally invasive interventions including angioembolization, stenting, and percutaneous drainage should be used when indicated. Short- and long-term outcomes are favorable when using conservative manage-ment approaches to Grade IV and V renal injuries. Further studies including prospective studies and randomized control trials are necessary. Cost analyses of current treatment protocols are also necessary to guide efficient management strategies.""
* Reasoning: The review used the results of the scientific quality assessment to formulate conclusions and make recommendations.
* Response: [Yes]

A9. Were the methods used to combine the findings of studies appropriate? For the pooled results, a test should be done to ensure the studies were combinable, to assess their homogeneity (i.e., Chi-squared test for homogeneity, I2 ). If heterogeneity exists a random effects model should be used and/or the clinical appropriateness of combining should be taken into consideration (i.e., is it sensible to combine?). Note: Indicate “yes” if they mention or describe heterogeneity, i.e., if they explain that they cannot pool because of heterogeneity/variability between interventions.

* Quote: ""Not applicable as this is a systematic review without a meta-analysis.""
* Reasoning: The review did not perform a meta-analysis, so this question is not applicable.
* Response: [NA]

A10. Was the likelihood of publication bias assessed? An assessment of publication bias should include a combination of graphical aids (e.g., funnel plot, other available tests) and/or statistical tests (e.g., Egger regression test, Hedges-Olken). Note: If no test values or funnel plot included, score “no”. Score “yes” if mentions that publication bias could not be assessed because there were fewer than 10 included studies.

* Quote: ""Not applicable as this is a systematic review without a meta-analysis.""
* Reasoning: The review did not perform a meta-analysis, so this question is not applicable.
* Response: [NA]

A11. Was the conflict of interest included? Potential sources of support should be clearly acknowledged in both the systematic review and the included studies. Note: To get a “yes,” must indicate source of funding or support for the systematic review AND for each of the included studies.

* Quote: ""Not applicable as the review does not mention any sources of funding or support.""

Early operative intervention should be implemented for hemodynamic instability. Intervention due to CT findings alone is not recommended. Minimally invasive interventions including angioembolization, stenting, and percutaneous drainage should be used when indicated and do not qualify as a failure of conservative therapy. Short- and long-term outcomes are favorable when using conservative manage-ment approaches to high-grade renal injuries. Further studies including prospective, randomized studies and cost-benefit analyses are essential to develop a comprehensive, standard-ized approach to the management of pediatric renal trauma, which will improve outcomes and maximize resource use.""

AMSTAR:

A1. Was an 'a priori' design provided? The research question and inclusion criteria should be established before the conduct of the review. Note: Need to refer to a protocol, ethics approval, or pre-determined/a priori published research objectives to score a “yes.”

* Quote: ""This systematic review was conducted according to the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses) statement.""
* Reasoning: The review was conducted according to the PRISMA statement, which implies that an 'a priori' design was provided.
* Response: [Yes]

A2. Was there duplicate study selection and data extraction? There should be at least two independent data extractors and a consensus procedure for disagreements should be in place. Note: 2 people do study selection, 2 people do data extraction, consensus process or one person checks the other’s work.

* Quote: ""Each article was independently assessed for eligibility using the following predefined criteria: "" [...] ""Studies were excluded from analysis if they allocated patients to either surgical technique based on patient characteristics, if they did not meet the inclusion criteria, or if primary outcome parameters of interest were not reported. In case of multiple studies reporting on an overlapping population, only the study with the largest patient population was included.""
* Reasoning: The review mentions that articles were independently assessed for eligibility, implying that there was duplicate study selection. However, it does not explicitly state that there was duplicate data extraction.
* Response: [No]

A3. Was a comprehensive literature search performed? At least two electronic sources should be searched. The report must include years and databases used (e.g., Central, EMBASE, and MEDLINE). Key words and/or MESH terms must be stated and where feasible the search strategy should be provided. All searches should be supplemented by consulting current contents, reviews, textbooks, specialized registers, or experts in the particular field of study, and by reviewing the references in the studies found. Note: If at least 2 sources + one supplementary strategy used, select “yes” (Cochrane register/Central counts as 2 sources; a grey literature search counts as supplementary).

* Quote: ""Using predefined search terms PubMed (1960 to 2011), EMBASE (from 1980 to 2011), and the Cochrane Library (issue 3, 2011) were systematically searched until March 16, 2011 to identify all articles comparing complete to partial fundoplication in children with GERD. For PubMed, the following search terms were used: (child*[Title/Abstract] OR infant*[Title/Abstract] OR adolescent*[Title/Abstract] OR pediatric*[Title/Abstract] OR paediatric*[Title/Abstract]) AND (nissen[Title/Abstract] OR toupet[Title/Abstract] OR thal[Title/Abstract] OR anti-reflux*[Title/Abstract] OR antireflux*[Title/Abstract] OR fundoplication[Title/Abstract] OR fundoplication[MeSH Terms]) AND gastroesophageal reflux[MeSH Terms]. The same search strategy was used in EMBASE (replacing “[Title/Abstract]” by; “ti,ab” and “[MeSH Terms]” by/exp). Human, child and adolescent were used as search limits in both databases. In addition, the Cochrane Library was manually searched.""
* Reasoning: The review mentions that at least two electronic sources were searched (PubMed and EMBASE) and the Cochrane Library was manually searched. The search strategy is provided, including years and databases used, and keywords and MeSH terms were stated.
* Response: [Yes]

A4. Was the status of publication (i.e. grey literature) used as an inclusion criterion? The authors should state that they searched for reports regardless of their publication type. The authors should state whether or not they excluded any reports (from the systematic review), based on their publication status, language etc. Note: If review indicates that there was a search for “grey literature” or “unpublished literature,” indicate “yes.” SIGLE database, dissertations, conference proceedings, and trial registries are all considered grey for this purpose. If searching a source that contains both grey and non-grey, must specify that they were searching for grey/unpublished lit.

* Quote: ""Studies were excluded from analysis if they allocated patients to either surgical technique based on patient characteristics, if they did not meet the inclusion criteria, or if primary outcome parameters of interest were not reported. In case of multiple studies reporting on an overlapping population, only the study with the largest patient population was included.""
* Reasoning: The review does not explicitly state that they searched for grey literature or reports regardless of their publication type.
* Response: [No]

A5. Was a list of studies (included and excluded) provided? A list of included and excluded studies should be provided. Note: Acceptable if the excluded studies are referenced. If there is an electronic link to the list but the link is dead, select “no.”

* Quote: ""In total, eight original studies that met the inclusion and exclusion criteria were selected.""
* Reasoning: The review provides a list of the eight studies that met the inclusion and exclusion criteria.
* Response: [Yes]

A6. Were the characteristics of the included studies provided? In an aggregated form such as a table, data from the original studies should be provided on the participants, interventions and outcomes. The ranges of characteristics in all the studies analyzed e.g., age, race, sex, relevant socioeconomic data, disease status, duration, severity, or other diseases should be reported. Note: Acceptable if not in table format as long as they are described as above.

* Quote: ""Included studies were published between 1994 and 2011 and reported on a total of 1 183 (588 complete and 595 partial fundoplications) children. Most studies only reported data on short-term follow-up. We detected a wide range in follow-up duration (0--192 months) and age at time of surgical intervention (7 days--21 years) between the included studies.""
* Reasoning: The review provides information on the characteristics of the included studies, including the number of studies, the number of participants, and the range of follow-up duration and age at time of surgical intervention.
* Response: [Yes]

A7. Was the scientific quality of the included studies assessed and documented? 'A priori' methods of assessment should be provided (e.g., for effectiveness studies if the author(s) chose to include only randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled studies, or allocation concealment as inclusion criteria); for other types of studies alternative items will be relevant. Note: Can include use of a quality scoring tool or checklist, e.g., Jadad scale, risk of bias, sensitivity analysis, etc., or a description of quality items, with some kind of result for EACH study (“low” or “high” is fine, as long as it is clear which studies scored “low” and which scored “high”; a summary score/range for all studies is not acceptable).

* Quote: ""Using predefined criteria, two authors (F.M. and B.B) included studies and assessed their methodological quality and risk of bias according to the PRISMA statement and the Cochrane Collaboration's tool for risk of bias assessment.""
* Reasoning: The review mentions that the methodological quality and risk of bias of the included studies were assessed using the PRISMA statement and the Cochrane Collaboration's tool for risk of bias assessment. However, it does not provide the results of this assessment.
* Response: [No]

A8. Was the scientific quality of the included studies used appropriately in formulating conclusions? The results of the methodological rigor and scientific quality should be considered in the analysis and the conclusions of the review, and explicitly stated in formulating recommendations. Note: Might say something such as “the results should be interpreted with caution due to poor quality of included studies.” Cannot score “yes” for this question if scored “no” for question A7.

* Quote: ""The overall methodological quality of included studies was generally poor. All except one of the included studies used a retrospective cohort design. Only Kubiak et al. randomly allocated patients to either complete or partial fundoplication. Three studies performed investigation techniques and/or questionnaires according to a predefined study protocol and only five studies reported data on the number of patients lost to follow-up. The potential threats to validity are summarized in Table 1.""
* Reasoning: The review mentions that the overall methodological quality of included studies was generally poor and provides information on the potential threats to validity.
* Response: [Yes]

A9. Were the methods used to combine the findings of studies appropriate? For the pooled results, a test should be done to ensure the studies were combinable, to assess their homogeneity (i.e., Chi-squared test for homogeneity, I2 ). If heterogeneity exists a random effects model should be used and/or the clinical appropriateness of combining should be taken into consideration (i.e., is it sensible to combine?). Note: Indicate “yes” if they mention or describe heterogeneity, i.e., if they explain that they cannot pool because of heterogeneity/variability between interventions.

* Quote: ""Studies were weighted on sample size and the number of events. Trials with zero events in one arm were included in the analysis by adding a continuity correction of 0.5 to all cells in the two-by-two table for that study. Trials with zero events in both arms were excluded from the meta-analysis. Heterogeneity was calculated using Higgins χ2 test (χ2 p value>0.1) and inconsistency in study effects was quantified by I2 values (I2 >50 %). Funnel plots were used to help identify the presence of publication or other types of bias.""
* Reasoning: The review mentions that studies were weighted on sample size and the number of events, and that heterogeneity was calculated using Higgins χ2 test and inconsistency in study effects was quantified by I2 values.
* Response: [Yes]

A10. Was the likelihood of publication bias assessed? An assessment of publication bias should include a combination of graphical aids (e.g., funnel plot, other available tests) and/or statistical tests (e.g., Egger regression test, Hedges-Olken). Note: If no test values or funnel plot included, score “no”. Score “yes” if mentions that publication bias could not be assessed because there were fewer than 10 included studies.

* Quote: ""Funnel plots were used to help identify the presence of publication or other types of bias.""
* Reasoning: The review mentions that funnel plots were used to help identify the presence of publication or other types of bias.
* Response: [Yes]

A11. Was the conflict of interest included? Potential sources of support should be clearly acknowledged in both the systematic review and the included studies. Note: To get a “yes,” must indicate source of funding or support for the systematic review AND for each of the included studies.

* Quote: ""Funding: Describe sources of funding for the systematic review and other support (e.g., supply of data); role of funders for the systematic review.""
* Reasoning: The review mentions that funding should be described for the systematic review and other support, but it does not provide information on the sources of funding or support for the systematic review or the included studies.
* Response: [No]

PRISMA:

P1. Title: Identify the report as a systematic review, meta-analysis, or both.

* Quote: ""Complete fundoplication (Nissen) has long been accepted as the gold standard surgical procedure in children with therapy-resistant gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD); however, increasingly more evidence has become available for partial fundoplication as an alternative. The aim of this study was to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis comparing complete versus partial fundoplication in children with therapy-resistant GERD.""

* Quote: ""Abstract Complete fundoplication (Nissen) has long been accepted as the gold standard surgical procedure in children with therapy-resistant gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD); however, increasingly more evidence has become available for partial fundoplication as an alternative. The aim of this study was to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis comparing complete versus partial fundoplication in children with therapy-resistant GERD. PubMed (1960 to 2011), EMBASE (from 1980 to 2011), and the Cochrane Library (issue 3, 2011) were systematically searched according to the PRISMA statement. Results were pooled in meta-analyses and expressed as risk ratios (RRs). In total, eight original trials comparing complete to partial fundoplication were identified. Seven of these studies had a retrospective study design. Short-term (RR 0.64; p=0.28) and long-term (RR 0.85; p=0.42) postoperative reflux control was similar for complete and partial fundoplication. Complete fundoplication required significantly more endoscopic dilatations for severe dysphagia (RR 7.26; p=0.007) than partial fundoplication. This systematic review and meta-analysis showed that reflux control is similar after both complete and partial fundoplication, while partial fundoplication significantly reduces the number of dilatations to treat severe dysphagia. However, because of the lack of a well-designed study, we have to be cautious in making definitive conclusions. To decide which type of fundoplication is the best practice in pediatric GERD patients, more randomized controlled trials comparing complete to partial fundoplication in children with GERD are warranted.""

AMSTAR:

A1. Was an 'a priori' design provided? The research question and inclusion criteria should be established before the conduct of the review. Note: Need to refer to a protocol, ethics approval, or pre-determined/a priori published research objectives to score a “yes.”

* Quote: ""This systematic review was conducted according to the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses) statement.""
* Reasoning: The review was conducted according to the PRISMA statement, which implies that an 'a priori' design was provided.
* Response: [Yes]

A2. Was there duplicate study selection and data extraction? There should be at least two independent data extractors and a consensus procedure for disagreements should be in place. Note: 2 people do study selection, 2 people do data extraction, consensus process or one person checks the other’s work.

* Quote: ""Each article was independently assessed for eligibility using the following predefined criteria: ...Studies were excluded from analysis if they allocated patients to either surgical technique based on patient characteristics, if they did not meet the inclusion criteria, or if primary outcome parameters of interest were not reported. In case of multiple studies reporting on an overlapping population, only the study with the largest patient population was included.""
* Reasoning: The review mentions that articles were independently assessed for eligibility, implying that there was duplicate study selection. However, it does not explicitly state that there was duplicate data extraction.
* Response: [No]

A3. Was a comprehensive literature search performed? At least two electronic sources should be searched. The report must include years and databases used (e.g., Central, EMBASE, and MEDLINE). Key words and/or MESH terms must be stated and where feasible the search strategy should be provided. All searches should be supplemented by consulting current contents, reviews, textbooks, specialized registers, or experts in the particular field of study, and by reviewing the references in the studies found. Note: If at least 2 sources + one supplementary strategy used, select “yes” (Cochrane register/Central counts as 2 sources; a grey literature search counts as supplementary).

* Quote: ""Using predefined search terms PubMed (1960 to 2011), EMBASE (from 1980 to 2011), and the Cochrane Library (issue 3, 2011) were systematically searched until March 16, 2011 to identify all articles comparing complete to partial fundoplication in children with GERD. For PubMed, the following search terms were used: (child*[Title/Abstract] OR infant*[Title/Abstract] OR adolescent*[Title/Abstract] OR pediatric*[Title/Abstract] OR paediatric*[Title/Abstract]) AND (nissen[Title/Abstract] OR toupet[Title/Abstract] OR thal[Title/Abstract] OR anti-reflux*[Title/Abstract] OR antireflux*[Title/Abstract] OR fundoplication[Title/Abstract] OR fundoplication[MeSH Terms]) AND gastroesophageal reflux[MeSH Terms]. The same search strategy was used in EMBASE (replacing “[Title/Abstract]” by; “ti,ab” and “[MeSH Terms]” by/exp). Human, child and adolescent were used as search limits in both databases. In addition, the Cochrane Library was manually searched.""
* Reasoning: The review mentions that at least two electronic sources were searched (PubMed and EMBASE) and the Cochrane Library was manually searched. The search strategy is provided, including years and databases used, and keywords and MeSH terms were stated.
* Response: [Yes]

A4. Was the status of publication (i.e. grey literature) used as an inclusion criterion? The authors should state that they searched for reports regardless of their publication type. The authors should state whether or not they excluded any reports (from the systematic review), based on their publication status, language etc. Note: If review indicates that there was a search for “grey literature” or “unpublished literature,” indicate “yes.” SIGLE database, dissertations, conference proceedings, and trial registries are all considered grey for this purpose. If searching a source that contains both grey and non-grey, must specify that they were searching for grey/unpublished lit.

* Quote: ""Studies were excluded from analysis if they allocated patients to either surgical technique based on patient characteristics, if they did not meet the inclusion criteria, or if primary outcome parameters of interest were not reported. In case of multiple studies reporting on an overlapping population, only the study with the largest patient population was included.""
* Reasoning: The review does not explicitly state that they searched for grey literature or reports regardless of their publication type.
* Response: [No]

A5. Was a list of studies (included and excluded) provided? A list of included and excluded studies should be provided. Note: Acceptable if the excluded studies are referenced. If there is an electronic link to the list but the link is dead, select “no.”

* Quote: ""In total, eight original studies that met the inclusion and exclusion criteria were selected.""
* Reasoning: The review provides a list of the eight studies that met the inclusion and exclusion criteria.
* Response: [Yes]

A6. Were the characteristics of the included studies provided? In an aggregated form such as a table, data from the original studies should be provided on the participants, interventions and outcomes. The ranges of characteristics in all the studies analyzed e.g., age, race, sex, relevant socioeconomic data, disease status, duration, severity, or other diseases should be reported. Note: Acceptable if not in table format as long as they are described as above.

* Quote: ""Included studies were published between 1994 and 2011 and reported on a total of 1 183 (588 complete and 595 partial fundoplications) children. Most studies only reported data on short-term follow-up. We detected a wide range in follow-up duration (0--192 months) and age at time of surgical intervention (7 days--21 years) between the included studies.""
* Reasoning: The review provides information on the characteristics of the included studies, including the number of studies, the number of participants, and the range of follow-up duration and age at time of surgical intervention.
* Response: [Yes]

A7. Was the scientific quality of the included studies assessed and documented? 'A priori' methods of assessment should be provided (e.g., for effectiveness studies if the author(s) chose to include only randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled studies, or allocation concealment as inclusion criteria); for other types of studies alternative items will be relevant. Note: Can include use of a quality scoring tool or checklist, e.g., Jadad scale, risk of bias, sensitivity analysis, etc., or a description of quality items, with some kind of result for EACH study (“low” or “high” is fine, as long as it is clear which studies scored “low” and which scored “high”; a summary score/range for all studies is not acceptable).

* Quote: ""Using predefined criteria, two authors (F.M. and B.B) included studies and assessed their methodological quality and risk of bias according to the PRISMA statement and the Cochrane Collaboration's tool for risk of bias assessment.""
* Reasoning: The review mentions that the methodological quality and risk of bias of the included studies were assessed using the PRISMA statement and the Cochrane Collaboration's tool for risk of bias assessment. However, it does not provide the results of this assessment.
* Response: [No]

A8. Was the scientific quality of the included studies used appropriately in formulating conclusions? The results of the methodological rigor and scientific quality should be considered in the analysis and the conclusions of the review, and explicitly stated in formulating recommendations. Note: Might say something such as “the results should be interpreted with caution due to poor quality of included studies.” Cannot score “yes” for this question if scored “no” for question A7.

* Quote: ""The overall methodological quality of included studies was generally poor. All except one of the included studies used a retrospective cohort design. Only Kubiak et al. randomly allocated patients to either complete or partial fundoplication. Three studies performed investigation techniques and/or questionnaires according to a predefined study protocol and only five studies reported data on the number of patients lost to follow-up. The potential threats to validity are summarized in Table 1.""
* Reasoning: The review mentions that the overall methodological quality of included studies was generally poor and provides information on the potential threats to validity.
* Response: [Yes]

A9. Were the methods used to combine the findings of studies appropriate? For the pooled results, a test should be done to ensure the studies were combinable, to assess their homogeneity (i.e., Chi-squared test for homogeneity, I2 ). If heterogeneity exists a random effects model should be used and/or the clinical appropriateness of combining should be taken into consideration (i.e., is it sensible to combine?). Note: Indicate “yes” if they mention or describe heterogeneity, i.e., if they explain that they cannot pool because of heterogeneity/variability between interventions.

* Quote: ""Studies were weighted on sample size and the number of events. Trials with zero events in one arm were included in the analysis by adding a continuity correction of 0.5 to all cells in the two-by-two table for that study. Trials with zero events in both arms were excluded from the meta-analysis. Heterogeneity was calculated using Higgins χ2 test (χ2 p value>0.1) and inconsistency in study effects was quantified by I2 values (I2 >50 %). Funnel plots were used to help identify the presence of publication or other types of bias.""
* Reasoning: The review mentions that studies were weighted on sample size and the number of events, and that heterogeneity was calculated using Higgins χ2 test and inconsistency in study effects was quantified by I2 values.
* Response: [Yes]

A10. Was the likelihood of publication bias assessed? An assessment of publication bias should include a combination of graphical aids (e.g., funnel plot, other available tests) and/or statistical tests (e.g., Egger regression test, Hedges-Olken). Note: If no test values or funnel plot included, score “no”. Score “yes” if mentions that publication bias could not be assessed because there were fewer than 10 included studies.

* Quote: ""Funnel plots were used to help identify the presence of publication or other types of bias.""
* Reasoning: The review mentions that funnel plots were used to help identify the presence of publication or other types of bias.
* Response: [Yes]

A11. Was the conflict of interest included? Potential sources of support should be clearly acknowledged in both the systematic review and the included studies. Note: To get a “yes,” must indicate source of funding or support for the systematic review AND for each of the included studies.

* Quote: ""Funding: Describe sources of funding for the systematic review and other support (e.g., supply of data); role of funders for the systematic review.""
* Reasoning: The review mentions that funding should be described for the systematic review and other support, but it does not provide information on the sources of funding or support for the systematic review or the included studies.
* Response: [No]

* Quote: ""Abstract Complete fundoplication (Nissen) has long been accepted as the gold standard surgical procedure in children with therapy-resistant gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD); however, increasingly more evidence has become available for partial fundoplication as an alternative. The aim of this study was to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis comparing complete versus partial fundoplication in children with therapy-resistant GERD. PubMed (1960 to 2011), EMBASE (from 1980 to 2011), and the Cochrane Library (issue 3, 2011) were systematically searched according to the PRISMA statement. Results were pooled in meta-analyses and expressed as risk ratios (RRs). In total, eight original trials comparing complete to partial fundoplication were identified. Seven of these studies had a retrospective study design. Short-term (RR 0.64; p=0.28) and long-term (RR 0.85; p=0.42) postoperative reflux control was similar for complete and partial fundoplication. Complete fundoplication required significantly more endoscopic dilatations for severe dysphagia (RR 7.26; p=0.007) than partial fundoplication. This systematic review and meta-analysis showed that reflux control is similar after both complete and partial fundoplication, while partial fundoplication significantly reduces the number of dilatations to treat severe dysphagia. However, because of the lack of a well-designed study, we have to be cautious in making definitive conclusions. To decide which type of fundoplication is the best practice in pediatric GERD patients, more randomized controlled trials comparing complete to partial fundoplication in children with GERD are warranted.""

* The text does not explicitly state that study selection and data extraction were performed independently by two people.
* Response: [No]

A3. Was a comprehensive literature search performed? At least two electronic sources should be searched. The report must include years and databases used (e.g., Central, EMBASE, and MEDLINE). Key words and/or MESH terms must be stated and where feasible the search strategy should be provided. All searches should be supplemented by consulting current contents, reviews, textbooks, specialized registers, or experts in the particular field of study, and by reviewing the references in the studies found. Note: If at least 2 sources + one supplementary strategy used, select “yes” (Cochrane register/Central counts as 2 sources; a grey literature search counts as supplementary).

* ""Studies were identified using Medline, Embase, and Cochrane databases using pre-specified search terms.""
* The text states that three electronic sources were searched, which is sufficient.
* Response: [Yes]

A4. Was the status of publication (i.e. grey literature) used as an inclusion criterion? The authors should state that they searched for reports regardless of their publication type. The authors should state whether or not they excluded any reports (from the systematic review), based on their publication status, language etc. Note: If review indicates that there was a search for “grey literature” or “unpublished literature,” indicate “yes.” SIGLE database, dissertations, conference proceedings, and trial registries are all considered grey for this purpose. If searching a source that contains both grey and non-grey, must specify that they were searching for grey/unpublished lit.

* The text provides a table with the characteristics of the included studies.
* Response: [Yes]

A7. Was the scientific quality of the included studies assessed and documented? 'A priori' methods of assessment should be provided (e.g., for effectiveness studies if the author(s) chose to include only randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled studies, or allocation concealment as inclusion criteria); for other types of studies alternative items will be relevant. Note: Can include use of a quality scoring tool or checklist, e.g., Jadad scale, risk of bias, sensitivity analysis, etc., or a description of quality items, with some kind of result for EACH study (“low” or “high” is fine, as long as it is clear which studies scored “low” and which scored “high”; a summary score/range for all studies is not acceptable).

* ""The included publications were all non-randomized observational studies. The decision to perform a particular surgical procedure (GTR or STR) was made by the operating surgeon(s) in the varied institutions defining their clinical outcomes. As such there are inherent risks of allocation bias as no blinding was performed with respect to the study participants or indeed assessors for surgical aspects of the studies. Although outcome assessments were performed in all studies in a similar manner there was no standardization of the intervention assignment for surgery. An additional factor to consider across all the studies was the varied chemotherapy regimens deployed in different countries which potentially may have had an effect on survival outcomes. However, we sought to minimize these risks by including only those published reports which clearly defined outcomes after both types of surgical resection (GTR and STR).""
* The text does not provide a clear assessment of the scientific quality of the included studies.
* Response: [No]

A8. Was the scientific quality of the included studies used appropriately in formulating conclusions? The results of the methodological rigor and scientific quality should be considered in the analysis and the conclusions of the review, and explicitly stated in formulating recommendations. Note: Might say something such as “the results should be interpreted with caution due to poor quality of included studies.” Cannot score “yes” for this question if scored “no” for question A7.

* ""Based on current “‘best evidence” we can report a clear survival advantage for GTR in stage 3 neuroblastoma. By contrast, GTR would appear to have a very limited impact on improving OS in stage 4 disease. We believe a prospective well-designed random-ized trial incorporating patient age, tumor site and elements of tumor biology (MYCN, DNA ploidy status, etc.) is needed to fully address the role of surgery in stage 4 neuroblastoma.""
* The text formulates conclusions based on the results of the review, but it does not explicitly consider the scientific quality of the included studies in formulating these conclusions.
* Response: [No]

A9. Were the methods used to combine the findings of studies appropriate? For the pooled results, a test should be done to ensure the studies were combinable, to assess their homogeneity (i.e., Chi-squared test for homogeneity, I2 ). If heterogeneity exists a random effects model should be used and/or the clinical appropriateness of combining should be taken into consideration (i.e., is it sensible to combine?). Note: Indicate “yes” if they mention or describe heterogeneity, i.e., if they explain that they cannot pool because of heterogeneity/variability between interventions.

* ""A meta-analysis was performed according to the recommendations from the Cochrane collaboration and PRISMA guidelines. Review Manager (Revman version 5.1.0) was used for the meta analysis. Odds ratios (OR) were calculated with 95% confidence intervals (CI) using Mantel–Haenszel calculations and a random ef-
fects model, and summary odds ratio for 5-year survival outcomes. I
2 
statistic was used to measure heterogeneity between studies.""
* The text states that a meta-analysis was performed and that a random effects model was used, but it does not explicitly state that the studies were tested for homogeneity.
* Response: [No]

A10. Was the likelihood of publication bias assessed? An assessment of publication bias should include a combination of graphical aids (e.g., funnel plot, other available tests) and/or statistical tests (e.g., Egger regression test, Hedges-Olken). Note: If no test values or funnel plot included, score “no”. Score “yes” if mentions that publication bias could not be assessed because there were fewer than 10 included studies.

* ""Funnel plots for stage 4 neuroblastoma studies showed grouping of studies at the apex of the plot suggesting that larger studies with higher patient numbers are more likely to have been included. The lack of studies gathered at the base of the plot suggests a paucity of publications of smaller sample size. The plot is not symmetrical suggesting that there is most likely to be elements of publication bias here.""
* The text states that a funnel plot was used to assess publication bias, but it does not explicitly state that any statistical tests were used.
* Response: [No]

A11. Was the conflict of interest included? Potential sources of support should be clearly acknowledged in both the systematic review and the included studies. Note: To get a “yes,” must indicate source of funding or support for the systematic review AND for each of the included studies.

* The text does not explicitly state whether potential sources of support were clearly acknowledged in the systematic review or the included studies.
* Response: [No]

* The text provides a table with the characteristics of the included studies.
* Response: [Yes]

A7. Was the scientific quality of the included studies assessed and documented? 'A priori' methods of assessment should be provided (e.g., for effectiveness studies if the author(s) chose to include only randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled studies, or allocation concealment as inclusion criteria); for other types of studies alternative items will be relevant. Note: Can include use of a quality scoring tool or checklist, e.g., Jadad scale, risk of bias, sensitivity analysis, etc., or a description of quality items, with some kind of result for EACH study (“low” or “high” is fine, as long as it is clear which studies scored “low” and which scored “high”; a summary score/range for all studies is not acceptable).

* ""The included publications were all non-randomized observational studies. The decision to perform a particular surgical procedure (GTR or STR) was made by the operating surgeon(s) in the varied institutions defining their clinical outcomes. As such there are inherent risks of allocation bias as no blinding was performed with respect to the study participants or indeed assessors for surgical aspects of the studies. Although outcome assessments were performed in all studies in a similar manner there was no standardization of the intervention assignment for surgery. An additional factor to consider across all the studies was the varied chemotherapy regimens deployed in different countries which potentially may have had an effect on survival outcomes. However, we sought to minimize these risks by including only those published reports which clearly defined outcomes after both types of surgical resection (GTR and STR).""
* The text does not provide a clear assessment of the scientific quality of the included studies.
* Response: [No]

A8. Was the scientific quality of the included studies used appropriately in formulating conclusions? The results of the methodological rigor and scientific quality should be considered in the analysis and the conclusions of the review, and explicitly stated in formulating recommendations. Note: Might say something such as “the results should be interpreted with caution due to poor quality of included studies.” Cannot score “yes” for this question if scored “no” for question A7.

* ""Based on current “‘best evidence” we can report a clear survival advantage for GTR in stage 3 neuroblastoma. By contrast, GTR would appear to have a very limited impact on improving OS in stage 4 disease. We believe a prospective well-designed random-ized trial incorporating patient age, tumor site and elements of tumor biology (MYCN, DNA ploidy status, etc.) is needed to fully address the role of surgery in stage 4 neuroblastoma.""
* The text formulates conclusions based on the results of the review, but it does not explicitly consider the scientific quality of the included studies in formulating these conclusions.
* Response: [No]

A9. Were the methods used to combine the findings of studies appropriate? For the pooled results, a test should be done to ensure the studies were combinable, to assess their homogeneity (i.e., Chi-squared test for homogeneity, I2 ). If heterogeneity exists a random effects model should be used and/or the clinical appropriateness of combining should be taken into consideration (i.e., is it sensible to combine?). Note: Indicate “yes” if they mention or describe heterogeneity, i.e., if they explain that they cannot pool because of heterogeneity/variability between interventions.

* ""A meta-analysis was performed according to the recommendations from the Cochrane collaboration and PRISMA guidelines. Review Manager (Revman version 5.1.0) was used for the meta analysis. Odds ratios (OR) were calculated with 95% confidence intervals (CI) using Mantel–Haenszel calculations and a random ef-
fects model, and summary odds ratio for 5-year survival outcomes. I

statistic was used to measure heterogeneity between studies.""
* The text states that a meta-analysis was performed and that a random effects model was used, but it does not explicitly state that the studies were tested for homogeneity.
* Response: [No]

A10. Was the likelihood of publication bias assessed? An assessment of publication bias should include a combination of graphical aids (e.g., funnel plot, other available tests) and/or statistical tests (e.g., Egger regression test, Hedges-Olken). Note: If no test values or funnel plot included, score “no”. Score “yes” if mentions that publication bias could not be assessed because there were fewer than 10 included studies.

* ""Funnel plots for stage 4 neuroblastoma studies showed grouping of studies at the apex of the plot suggesting that larger studies with higher patient numbers are more likely to have been included. The lack of studies gathered at the base of the plot suggests a paucity of publications of smaller sample size. The plot is not symmetrical suggesting that there is most likely to be elements of publication bias here.""
* The text states that a funnel plot was used to assess publication bias, but it does not explicitly state that any statistical tests were used.
* Response: [No]

A11. Was the conflict of interest included? Potential sources of support should be clearly acknowledged in both the systematic review and the included studies. Note: To get a “yes,” must indicate source of funding or support for the systematic review AND for each of the included studies.

* The text does not explicitly state whether potential sources of support were clearly acknowledged in the systematic review or the included studies.

Abstract / Structured summary: Provide a structured summary including, as applicable: background; objectives; data sources; study eligibility criteria, participants, and interventions; study appraisal and synthesis methods; results; limitations; conclusions and implications of key findings; systematic review registration number.

* ""Background: Long-gap esophageal atresia (EA) represents a challenging problem for pediatric surgeons, and a large number of techniques and approaches have been proposed. One of the more recent, initially published by Foker, is the use of mechanical traction to accelerate the growth of the esophageal ends and permit earlier primary anastomosis. The purpose of this study is to critically evaluate the existing literature on this topic and to compare the Foker technique to the more conventional delayed primary anastomosis. Methods: A systematic review and cumulative meta-analysis was performed, including all articles describing the Foker procedure or delayed primary anastomosis. Primary outcome was complications, and secondary outcome was time to final anastomosis. Results: Six articles on the Foker procedure met the criteria for inclusion. None were prospective or randomized. These articles represented 71 infants undergoing the Foker procedure, which were compared with 451 children from 44 studies utilizing delayed primary anastomosis. The Foker procedure was associated with a significantly lower risk of complications (leak, stricture, and gastroesophageal reflux), and with a significantly shorter time to definitive anastomosis. Conclusions: The use of mechanical traction appears to be at least as effective as delayed primary anastomosis for the management of long-gap EA. Future prospective studies and the establishment of a prospective registry are required to further elucidate this issue.""

* ""Esophageal atresia (EA) is a relatively common congenital malformation of unknown etiology with an incidence of 1 in 3,500 live births. Pure EA without tracheoesophageal fistula (TEF) is an uncommon variant, comprising 8% of all patients with EA, with an expected incidence of 1 in 40,000 live births. Improvements in prenatal diagnosis and care, advances in surgical technique, pediatric anesthesia, neonatal intensive care, and nutritional support have increased the survival rate in EA in recent years to approximately 95%. Although most children with EA can undergo primary repair in the neonatal period, the presence of prematurity, associated anomalies and long-gap EA may preclude an immediate primary end-to-end anastomosis. Thus, surgical management of patients with long-gap EA represents a major challenge to pediatric surgeons.""

P2. Abstract / Structured summary: Provide a structured summary including, as applicable: background; objectives; data sources; study eligibility criteria, participants, and interventions; study appraisal and synthesis methods; results; limitations; conclusions and implications of key findings; systematic review registration number.

* ""Background: Long-gap esophageal atresia (EA) represents a challenging problem for pediatric surgeons, and a large number of techniques and approaches have been proposed. One of the more recent, initially published by Foker, is the use of mechanical traction to accelerate the growth of the esophageal ends and permit earlier primary anastomosis. The purpose of this study is to critically evaluate the existing literature on this topic and to compare the Foker technique to the more conventional delayed primary anastomosis. Methods: A systematic review and cumulative meta-analysis was performed, including all articles describing the Foker procedure or delayed primary anastomosis. Primary outcome was complications, and secondary outcome was time to final anastomosis. Results: Six articles on the Foker procedure met the criteria for inclusion. None were prospective or randomized. These articles represented 71 infants undergoing the Foker procedure, which were compared with 451 children from 44 studies utilizing delayed primary anastomosis. The Foker procedure was associated with a significantly lower risk of complications (leak, stricture, and gastroesophageal reflux), and with a significantly shorter time to definitive anastomosis. Conclusions: The use of mechanical traction appears to be at least as effective as delayed primary anastomosis for the management of long-gap EA. Future prospective studies and the establishment of a prospective registry are required to further elucidate this issue.""

P3. Introduction / Rationale: Describe the rationale for the review in the context of what is already known.

* ""Esophageal atresia (EA) is a relatively common congenital malformation of unknown etiology with an incidence of 1 in 3,500 live births. Pure EA without tracheoesophageal fistula (TEF) is an uncommon variant, comprising 8% of all patients with EA, with an expected incidence of 1 in 40,000 live births. Improvements in prenatal diagnosis and care, advances in surgical technique, pediatric anesthesia, neonatal intensive care, and nutritional support have increased the survival rate in EA in recent years to approximately 95%. Although most children with EA can undergo primary repair in the neonatal period, the presence of prematurity, associated anomalies and long-gap EA may preclude an immediate primary end-to-end anastomosis. Thus, surgical management of patients with long-gap EA represents a major challenge to pediatric surgeons.""

AMSTAR:

A1. Was an 'a priori' design provided? The research question and inclusion criteria should be established before the conduct of the review. Note: Need to refer to a protocol, ethics approval, or pre-determined/a priori published research objectives to score a “yes.”

* Quote: ""We undertook a systematic review of all studies published over a period of 20 years (1994–2014) that assessed functional outcomes for OD and/or LD procedures for HD.""
* Reasoning: The research question and inclusion criteria are not explicitly stated in the text, but the authors mention that they conducted a systematic review of studies published over a period of 20 years that assessed functional outcomes for OD and/or LD procedures for HD.
* Response: [No]

A2. Was there duplicate study selection and data extraction? There should be at least two independent data extractors and a consensus procedure for disagreements should be in place. Note: 2 people do study selection, 2 people do data extraction, consensus process or one person checks the other’s work.

* Quote: ""We undertook a systematic review of all studies published over a period of 20 years (1994–2014) that assessed functional outcomes for OD and/or LD procedures for HD.""
* Reasoning: The text does not provide information on whether study selection and data extraction were performed independently by two or more individuals.
* Response: [No]

A3. Was a comprehensive literature search performed? At least two electronic sources should be searched. The report must include years and databases used (e.g., Central, EMBASE, and MEDLINE). Key words and/or MESH terms must be stated and where feasible the search strategy should be provided. All searches should be supplemented by consulting current contents, reviews, textbooks, specialized registers, or experts in the particular field of study, and by reviewing the references in the studies found. Note: If at least 2 sources + one supplementary strategy used, select “yes” (Cochrane register/Central counts as 2 sources; a grey literature search counts as supplementary).

* Quote: ""A systematic PubMed search was performed to identify publications that analyzed outcomes for LD or OD pull-through procedures for HD. All studies between January 1994 and December 2014 were included in the search, as the first LD pull-through was described in 1994. Combinations of the key words ‘‘Hirschsprung disease,’’ ‘‘Duhamel,’’ ‘‘pull-through,’’ ‘‘lapa-roscopic,’’ ‘‘minimally invasive’’ and ‘‘open’’ were used.""
* Reasoning: The authors mention that they conducted a systematic search of publications in PubMed between January 1994 and December 2014 using specific keywords. However, they do not mention whether they searched additional electronic sources or used any supplementary strategies.
* Response: [No]

A4. Was the status of publication (i.e. grey literature) used as an inclusion criterion? The authors should state that they searched for reports regardless of their publication type. The authors should state whether or not they excluded any reports (from the systematic review), based on their publication status, language etc. Note: If review indicates that there was a search for “grey literature” or “unpublished literature,” indicate “yes.” SIGLE database, dissertations, conference proceedings, and trial registries are all considered grey for this purpose. If searching a source that contains both grey and non-grey, must specify that they were searching for grey/unpublished lit.

* Quote: ""All studies assessing functional outcome for OD and/or LD procedures for HD were analyzed for eligibility, including randomized control trials and observational studies. Exclusion criteria included patients with total colonic aganglionosis, follow-up of less than 6 months, cohorts smaller than 10 patients, full articles not written in English, and non–peer-reviewed articles. Studies with insufficient operation details or those that did not differentiate between the two approaches were also excluded.""
* Reasoning: The authors mention that they excluded studies based on language and peer-review status, but they do not mention whether they searched for or included grey literature.
* Response: [No]

A5. Was a list of studies (included and excluded) provided? A list of included and excluded studies should be provided. Note: Acceptable if the excluded studies are referenced. If there is an electronic link to the list but the link is dead, select “no.”

* Quote: ""Eleven articles met our strict inclusion criteria and were included in the meta-analysis.""
* Reasoning: The authors mention that they included 11 articles in their meta-analysis, but they do not provide a list of included or excluded studies.
* Response: [No]

A6. Were the characteristics of the included studies provided? In an aggregated form such as a table, data from the original studies should be provided on the participants, interventions and outcomes. The ranges of characteristics in all the studies analyzed e.g., age, race, sex, relevant socioeconomic data, disease status, duration, severity, or other diseases should be reported. Note: Acceptable if not in table format as long as they are described as above.

* Quote: ""Four hundred fifty-six patients with HD were included in this review (range, 20--76 patients per study). Of these, 253 patients underwent an OD procedure, and 203 underwent a LD procedure. The median age at surgery in the open group was 6.9 months (range, 4--42 months), compared with 11.3 months (range, 3.1--17.2 months) in the laparoscopic group. Median follow-up in the open group was 64.8 months (range, 14--87.8 months) compared with 61.2 months in the laparoscopic group (range, 39.5--80 months).""
* Reasoning: The authors provide some characteristics of the included studies, including the number of patients, age at surgery, and follow-up duration. However, they do not provide information on the interventions or outcomes.
* Response: [No]

A7. Was the scientific quality of the included studies assessed and documented? 'A priori' methods of assessment should be provided (e.g., for effectiveness studies if the author(s) chose to include only randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled studies, or allocation concealment as inclusion criteria); for other types of studies alternative items will be relevant. Note: Can include use of a quality scoring tool or checklist, e.g., Jadad scale, risk of bias, sensitivity analysis, etc., or a description of quality items, with some kind of result for EACH study (“low” or “high” is fine, as long as it is clear which studies scored “low” and which scored “high”; a summary score/range for all studies is not acceptable).

* Quote: ""The risk of bias was assessed and summarized for the 11 articles included in the meta-analysis.""
* Reasoning: The authors mention that they assessed the risk of bias for the included studies, but they do not provide information on the methods of assessment or the results for each study.
* Response: [No]

A8. Was the scientific quality of the included studies used appropriately in formulating conclusions? The results of the methodological rigor and scientific quality should be considered in the analysis and the conclusions of the review, and explicitly stated in formulating recommendations. Note: Might say something such as “the results should be interpreted with caution due to poor quality of included studies.” Cannot score “yes” for this question if scored “no” for question A7.

* Quote: ""Our meta-analysis convincingly demonstrates the superiority of LD over OD pull-through for HD.""
* Reasoning: The authors conclude that laparoscopic Duhamel (LD) is superior to open Duhamel (OD) for Hirschsprung's disease (HD), but they do not mention or consider the scientific quality of the included studies in their conclusions.
* Response: [No]

A9. Were the methods used to combine the findings of studies appropriate? For the pooled results, a test should be done to ensure the studies were combinable, to assess their homogeneity (i.e., Chi-squared test for homogeneity, I2 ). If heterogeneity exists a random effects model should be used and/or the clinical appropriateness of combining should be taken into consideration (i.e., is it sensible to combine?). Note: Indicate “yes” if they mention or describe heterogeneity, i.e., if they explain that they cannot pool because of heterogeneity/variability between interventions.

* Quote: ""A cumulative meta-analysis was then performed, to compare the incidence of each outcome in patients who underwent the OD procedure with those who underwent the LD procedure. Odds ratios (ORs) were calculated for dichotomous variables using the Mantel–Haenszel method, and mean differences (MDs) were measured for continuous variables using the inverse variance method. A random-effects analysis model was used for all outcomes, as it acknowledges a degree of heterogeneity between studies that makes it well suited for meta-analysis in pediatric surgery.""
* Reasoning: The authors mention that they used a random-effects analysis model and calculated odds ratios and mean differences for the pooled results, but they do not provide information on the homogeneity of the studies or the clinical appropriateness of combining the findings.
* Response: [No]

A10. Was the likelihood of publication bias assessed? An assessment of publication bias should include a combination of graphical aids (e.g., funnel plot, other available tests) and/or statistical tests (e.g., Egger regression test, Hedges-Olken). Note: If no test values or funnel plot included, score “no”. Score “yes” if mentions that publication bias could not be assessed because there were fewer than 10 included studies.

* Quote: ""Statistical heterogeneity was assessed using I2 .""
* Reasoning: The authors mention that they assessed statistical heterogeneity using I2, but they do not mention whether they assessed publication bias.
* Response: [No]

A11. Was the conflict of interest included? Potential sources of support should be clearly acknowledged in both the systematic review and the included studies. Note: To get a “yes,” must indicate source of funding or support for the systematic review AND for each of the included studies.

* Quote: ""Department of Paediatric Surgery, Birmingham Children’s Hospital, Birmingham, United Kingdom.""
* Reasoning: The authors do not mention the source of funding or support for the systematic review or the included studies.
* Response: [No]

Abstract / Structured summary: Provide a structured summary including, as applicable: background; objectives; data sources; study eligibility criteria, participants, and interventions; study appraisal and synthesis methods; results; limitations; conclusions and implications of key findings; systematic review registration number.

* Quote: ""Abstract: Introduction: Since its introduction in 1956, the Duhamel procedure has been and remains one of the most widely performed for Hirschsprung’s disease (HD). The most significant modification to this procedure has been the incorporation of laparoscopy, while the original principles of the method have been retained. This study compared long-term outcomes for open Duhamel (OD) and laparoscopic Duhamel (LD) procedures for HD, to identify any added advantage of the laparoscopic technique. Materials and Methods: We undertook a systematic review of all studies published over a period of 20 years (1994--2014) that assessed functional outcomes for OD and/or LD procedures for HD. Odds ratios were calculated for dichotomous variables, and mean difference values were calculated for continuous variables. Results: From 11 articles 456 patients were included (253 OD, 203 LD), with no significant difference in age at surgery and length of follow-up (P > .05). The open group had a significantly greater incidence of soiling/incontinence (11% versus 4%; P = .02) and further surgery (25% versus 14%; P = .005), longer hospital stay (9.79 versus 7.3 days; P < .00001), and time to oral feed (4.05 versus 3.27 days; P < .00001). Operative time was significantly longer in the laparoscopic group (3.83 versus 4.09 hours; P = .004). There was no significant difference in incidence of enterocolitis (15% versus 10%; P = .14) and constipation (23% versus 30%; P = .12). Conclusions: Our meta-analysis convincingly demonstrates the superiority of LD over OD pull-through for HD. Prospective, randomized control trials are required to overcome limitations in the current literature.""

AMSTAR:

A1. Was an 'a priori' design provided? The research question and inclusion criteria should be established before the conduct of the review. Note: Need to refer to a protocol, ethics approval, or pre-determined/a priori published research objectives to score a “yes.”

* Quote: ""We undertook a systematic review of all studies published over a period of 20 years (1994–2014) that assessed functional outcomes for OD and/or LD procedures for HD.""
* Reasoning: The research question and inclusion criteria are not explicitly stated in the text, but the authors mention that they conducted a systematic review of studies published over a period of 20 years that assessed functional outcomes for OD and/or LD procedures for HD.
* Response: [No]

A2. Was there duplicate study selection and data extraction? There should be at least two independent data extractors and a consensus procedure for disagreements should be in place. Note: 2 people do study selection, 2 people do data extraction, consensus process or one person checks the other’s work.

* Quote: ""We undertook a systematic review of all studies published over a period of 20 years (1994–2014) that assessed functional outcomes for OD and/or LD procedures for HD.""
* Reasoning: The text does not provide information on whether study selection and data extraction were performed independently by two or more individuals.
* Response: [No]

A3. Was a comprehensive literature search performed? At least two electronic sources should be searched. The report must include years and databases used (e.g., Central, EMBASE, and MEDLINE). Key words and/or MESH terms must be stated and where feasible the search strategy should be provided. All searches should be supplemented by consulting current contents, reviews, textbooks, specialized registers, or experts in the particular field of study, and by reviewing the references in the studies found. Note: If at least 2 sources + one supplementary strategy used, select “yes” (Cochrane register/Central counts as 2 sources; a grey literature search counts as supplementary).

* Quote: ""A systematic PubMed search was performed to identify publications that analyzed outcomes for LD or OD pull-through procedures for HD. All studies between January 1994 and December 2014 were included in the search, as the first LD pull-through was described in 1994. Combinations of the key words ‘‘Hirschsprung disease,’’ ‘‘Duhamel,’’ ‘‘pull-through,’’ ‘‘lapa-roscopic,’’ ‘‘minimally invasive’’ and ‘‘open’’ were used.""
* Reasoning: The authors mention that they conducted a systematic search of publications in PubMed between January 1994 and December 2014 using specific keywords. However, they do not mention whether they searched additional electronic sources or used any supplementary strategies.
* Response: [No]

A4. Was the status of publication (i.e. grey literature) used as an inclusion criterion? The authors should state that they searched for reports regardless of their publication type. The authors should state whether or not they excluded any reports (from the systematic review), based on their publication status, language etc. Note: If review indicates that there was a search for “grey literature” or “unpublished literature,” indicate “yes.” SIGLE database, dissertations, conference proceedings, and trial registries are all considered grey for this purpose. If searching a source that contains both grey and non-grey, must specify that they were searching for grey/unpublished lit.

* Quote: ""All studies assessing functional outcome for OD and/or LD procedures for HD were analyzed for eligibility, including randomized control trials and observational studies. Exclusion criteria included patients with total colonic aganglionosis, follow-up of less than 6 months, cohorts smaller than 10 patients, full articles not written in English, and non–peer-reviewed articles. Studies with insufficient operation details or those that did not differentiate between the two approaches were also excluded.""
* Reasoning: The authors mention that they excluded studies based on language and peer-review status, but they do not mention whether they searched for or included grey literature.
* Response: [No]

A5. Was a list of studies (included and excluded) provided? A list of included and excluded studies should be provided. Note: Acceptable if the excluded studies are referenced. If there is an electronic link to the list but the link is dead, select “no.”

* Quote: ""Eleven articles met our strict inclusion criteria and were included in the meta-analysis.""
* Reasoning: The authors mention that they included 11 articles in their meta-analysis, but they do not provide a list of included or excluded studies.
* Response: [No]

A6. Were the characteristics of the included studies provided? In an aggregated form such as a table, data from the original studies should be provided on the participants, interventions and outcomes. The ranges of characteristics in all the studies analyzed e.g., age, race, sex, relevant socioeconomic data, disease status, duration, severity, or other diseases should be reported. Note: Acceptable if not in table format as long as they are described as above.

* Quote: ""Four hundred fifty-six patients with HD were included in this review (range, 20--76 patients per study). Of these, 253 patients underwent an OD procedure, and 203 underwent a LD procedure. The median age at surgery in the open group was 6.9 months (range, 4--42 months), compared with 11.3 months (range, 3.1--17.2 months) in the laparoscopic group. Median follow-up in the open group was 64.8 months (range, 14--87.8 months) compared with 61.2 months in the laparoscopic group (range, 39.5--80 months).""
* Reasoning: The authors provide some characteristics of the included studies, including the number of patients, age at surgery, and follow-up duration. However, they do not provide information on the interventions or outcomes.
* Response: [No]

A7. Was the scientific quality of the included studies assessed and documented? 'A priori' methods of assessment should be provided (e.g., for effectiveness studies if the author(s) chose to include only randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled studies, or allocation concealment as inclusion criteria); for other types of studies alternative items will be relevant. Note: Can include use of a quality scoring tool or checklist, e.g., Jadad scale, risk of bias, sensitivity analysis, etc., or a description of quality items, with some kind of result for EACH study (“low” or “high” is fine, as long as it is clear which studies scored “low” and which scored “high”; a summary score/range for all studies is not acceptable).

* Quote: ""The risk of bias was assessed and summarized for the 11 articles included in the meta-analysis.""
* Reasoning: The authors mention that they assessed the risk of bias for the included studies, but they do not provide information on the methods of assessment or the results for each study.
* Response: [No]

A8. Was the scientific quality of the included studies used appropriately in formulating conclusions? The results of the methodological rigor and scientific quality should be considered in the analysis and the conclusions of the review, and explicitly stated in formulating recommendations. Note: Might say something such as “the results should be interpreted with caution due to poor quality of included studies.” Cannot score “yes” for this question if scored “no” for question A7.

* Quote: ""Our meta-analysis convincingly demonstrates the superiority of LD over OD pull-through for HD.""
* Reasoning: The authors conclude that laparoscopic Duhamel (LD) is superior to open Duhamel (OD) for Hirschsprung's disease (HD), but they do not mention or consider the scientific quality of the included studies in their conclusions.
* Response: [No]

A9. Were the methods used to combine the findings of studies appropriate? For the pooled results, a test should be done to ensure the studies were combinable, to assess their homogeneity (i.e., Chi-squared test for homogeneity, I2 ). If heterogeneity exists a random effects model should be used and/or the clinical appropriateness of combining should be taken into consideration (i.e., is it sensible to combine?). Note: Indicate “yes” if they mention or describe heterogeneity, i.e., if they explain that they cannot pool because of heterogeneity/variability between interventions.

* Quote: ""A cumulative meta-analysis was then performed, to compare the incidence of each outcome in patients who underwent the OD procedure with those who underwent the LD procedure. Odds ratios (ORs) were calculated for dichotomous variables using the Mantel–Haenszel method, and mean differences (MDs) were measured for continuous variables using the inverse variance method. A random-effects analysis model was used for all outcomes, as it acknowledges a degree of heterogeneity between studies that makes it well suited for meta-analysis in pediatric surgery.""
* Reasoning: The authors mention that they used a random-effects analysis model and calculated odds ratios and mean differences for the pooled results, but they do not provide information on the homogeneity of the studies or the clinical appropriateness of combining the findings.
* Response: [No]

A10. Was the likelihood of publication bias assessed? An assessment of publication bias should include a combination of graphical aids (e.g., funnel plot, other available tests) and/or statistical tests (e.g., Egger regression test, Hedges-Olken). Note: If no test values or funnel plot included, score “no”. Score “yes” if mentions that publication bias could not be assessed because there were fewer than 10 included studies.

* Quote: ""Statistical heterogeneity was assessed using I2 .""
* Reasoning: The authors mention that they assessed statistical heterogeneity using I2, but they do not mention whether they assessed publication bias.
* Response: [No]

A11. Was the conflict of interest included? Potential sources of support should be clearly acknowledged in both the systematic review and the included studies. Note: To get a “yes,” must indicate source of funding or support for the systematic review AND for each of the included studies.

* Quote: ""Department of Paediatric Surgery, Birmingham Children’s Hospital, Birmingham, United Kingdom.""
* Reasoning: The authors do not mention the source of funding or support for the systematic review or the included studies.
* Response: [No]

Abstract / Structured summary: Provide a structured summary including, as applicable: background; objectives; data sources; study eligibility criteria, participants, and interventions; study appraisal and synthesis methods; results; limitations; conclusions and implications of key findings; systematic review registration number.

* Quote: ""Abstract: Introduction: Since its introduction in 1956, the Duhamel procedure has been and remains one of the most widely performed for Hirschsprung’s disease (HD). The most significant modification to this procedure has been the incorporation of laparoscopy, while the original principles of the method have been retained. This study compared long-term outcomes for open Duhamel (OD) and laparoscopic Duhamel (LD) procedures for HD, to identify any added advantage of the laparoscopic technique. Materials and Methods: We undertook a systematic review of all studies published over a period of 20 years (1994--2014) that assessed functional outcomes for OD and/or LD procedures for HD. Odds ratios were calculated for dichotomous variables, and mean difference values were calculated for continuous variables. Results: From 11 articles 456 patients were included (253 OD, 203 LD), with no significant difference in age at surgery and length of follow-up (P > .05). The open group had a significantly greater incidence of soiling/incontinence (11% versus 4%; P = .02) and further surgery (25% versus 14%; P = .005), longer hospital stay (9.79 versus 7.3 days; P < .00001), and time to oral feed (4.05 versus 3.27 days; P < .00001). Operative time was significantly longer in the laparoscopic group (3.83 versus 4.09 hours; P = .004). There was no significant difference in incidence of enterocolitis (15% versus 10%; P = .14) and constipation (23% versus 30%; P = .12). Conclusions: Our meta-analysis convincingly demonstrates the superiority of LD over OD pull-through for HD. Prospective, randomized control trials are required to overcome limitations in the current literature.""

Abstract / Structured summary: Provide a structured summary including, as applicable: background; objectives; data sources; study eligibility criteria, participants, and interventions; study appraisal and synthesis methods; results; limitations; conclusions and implications of key findings; systematic review registration number.

* ""Background: Intestinal intussusception is a frequent cause of bowel obstruction in children. Initial treatment involves pneumatic reduction. If this fails, operative reduction is indicated. There is controversy regarding use of the laparoscopic (LAP) versus the conventional open approach. Patients and Methods: We performed a retrospective review of all children with intussusception who required operative reduction at our institution over a 12-year time period. We also performed a meta-analysis to combine our data with the published literature. Results: We identified 28 patients requiring operative intervention for reduction of intussusception between January 2000 and April 2012. Five patients underwent LAP reduction, and 23 patients underwent open reduction. Operative times were not statistically different. The rate of overall complications was not statistically different, with 1 of 5 (20%) and 7 of 23 (30%) having complications in the LAP and open groups, respectively. Mean length of stay was 3.8 -- 2.1 days in both the LAP and open groups, with no significant difference. Our meta-analysis identified five retrospective studies comparing LAP and open techniques for reduction of intussusception. We did not find a significant difference between groups with respect to operative time, overall complication rates, or re-operation rates. However, the length of hospital stay was significantly longer in the open group. Conclusions: LAP reduction of intussusception is a safe and feasible alternative to the open approach. Length of stay may be shorter in the LAP group.""

P3. Introduction / Rationale: Describe the rationale for the review in the context of what is already known.

* ""I ntussusception in children may result in significant morbidity and mortality if not treated in a timely fashion.

Abstract / Structured summary: Provide a structured summary including, as applicable: background; objectives; data sources; study eligibility criteria, participants, and interventions; study appraisal and synthesis methods; results; limitations; conclusions and implications of key findings; systematic review registration number.

* ""Background: Intestinal intussusception is a frequent cause of bowel obstruction in children. Initial treatment involves pneumatic reduction. If this fails, operative reduction is indicated. There is controversy regarding use of the laparoscopic (LAP) versus the conventional open approach. Patients and Methods: We performed a retrospective review of all children with intussusception who required operative reduction at our institution over a 12-year time period. We also performed a meta-analysis to combine our data with the published literature. Results: We identified 28 patients requiring operative intervention for reduction of intussusception between January 2000 and April 2012. Five patients underwent LAP reduction, and 23 patients underwent open reduction. Operative times were not statistically different. The rate of overall complications was not statistically different, with 1 of 5 (20%) and 7 of 23 (30%) having complications in the LAP and open groups, respectively. Mean length of stay was 3.8 -- 2.1 days in both the LAP and open groups, with no significant difference. Our meta-analysis identified five retrospective studies comparing LAP and open techniques for reduction of intussusception. We did not find a significant difference between groups with respect to operative time, overall complication rates, or re-operation rates. However, the length of hospital stay was significantly longer in the open group. Conclusions: LAP reduction of intussusception is a safe and feasible alternative to the open approach. Length of stay may be shorter in the LAP group.""

AMSTAR:

A1. Was an 'a priori' design provided? The research question and inclusion criteria should be established before the conduct of the review. Note: Need to refer to a protocol, ethics approval, or pre-determined/a priori published research objectives to score a “yes.”

* Quote: “This review was performed according to a protocol that was designed a priori and recommended for systematic reviews and meta-analyses.”
* Reasoning: The review was conducted according to a pre-determined protocol, indicating that an 'a priori' design was provided.
* Response: [Yes]

A2. Was there duplicate study selection and data extraction? There should be at least two independent data extractors and a consensus procedure for disagreements should be in place. Note: 2 people do study selection, 2 people do data extraction, consensus process or one person checks the other’s work.

* Quote: “Two authors reviewed all the abstracts independently. Agreement regarding potential relevance was reached by consensus. Full-text copies of potentially eligible papers were obtained, and the same 2 reviewers independently extracted relevant data on study characteristics and the outcomes of interest. Inconsistencies were discussed by the authors and consensus reached.”
* Reasoning: Two authors independently reviewed the abstracts and extracted data, reaching consensus on potential relevance and study characteristics.
* Response: [Yes]

A3. Was a comprehensive literature search performed? At least two electronic sources should be searched. The report must include years and databases used (e.g., Central, EMBASE, and MEDLINE). Key words and/or MESH terms must be stated and where feasible the search strategy should be provided. All searches should be supplemented by consulting current contents, reviews, textbooks, specialized registers, or experts in the particular field of study, and by reviewing the references in the studies found. Note: If at least 2 sources + one supplementary strategy used, select “yes” (Cochrane register/Central counts as 2 sources; a grey literature search counts as supplementary).

* Quote: “Medline, Embase, Cinahl, and Cochrane databases were searched electronically on April 24, 2014, and then updated on May 11, 2015; the search was limited to reports published after January 1, 1980. One author and 2 librarians were involved in the search, and combinations of the relevant medical subject heading terms, key words, and word variants for ‘isomerism,’ ‘heterotaxy,’ ‘situs ambiguous,’ ‘Ivemark,’ and ‘malrotation’ were used. The search was restricted to literature written in English. The Meta-analysis Of Observational Studies (ie, MOOSE) guidelines were followed. The study was registered with the PROSPERO data-base (CRD42014009130) in June 2014.”
* Reasoning: The review searched four electronic databases, used relevant medical subject heading terms, key words, and word variants, and restricted the search to literature written in English.
* Response: [Yes]

A4. Was the status of publication (i.e. grey literature) used as an inclusion criterion? The authors should state that they searched for reports regardless of their publication type. The authors should state whether or not they excluded any reports (from the systematic review), based on their publication status, language etc. Note: If review indicates that there was a search for “grey literature” or “unpublished literature,” indicate “yes.” SIGLE database, dissertations, conference proceedings, and trial registries are all considered grey for this purpose. If searching a source that contains both grey and non-grey, must specify that they were searching for grey/unpublished lit.

* Quote: “The search was restricted to literature written in English.”
* Reasoning: The review restricted the search to literature written in English, indicating that grey literature was not included in the search strategy.
* Response: [No]

A5. Was a list of studies (included and excluded) provided? A list of included and excluded studies should be provided. Note: Acceptable if the excluded studies are referenced. If there is an electronic link to the list but the link is dead, select “no.”

* Quote: “Of those, full text of 50 articles were assessed with respect to their eligibility for inclusion (Figure 1), studies that were excluded are listed with their reasons for exclusion in Table I (available at www.jpeds.com), including 1 study that was excluded after peer-review process.”
* Reasoning: The review provided a list of excluded studies with reasons for exclusion.
* Response: [Yes]

A6. Were the characteristics of the included studies provided? In an aggregated form such as a table, data from the original studies should be provided on the participants, interventions and outcomes. The ranges of characteristics in all the studies analyzed e.g., age, race, sex, relevant socioeconomic data, disease status, duration, severity, or other diseases should be reported. Note: Acceptable if not in table format as long as they are described as above.

* Quote: “The general characteristics of these studies are reported in Table II.”
* Reasoning: The review provided a table summarizing the general characteristics of the included studies.
* Response: [Yes]

A7. Was the scientific quality of the included studies assessed and documented? 'A priori' methods of assessment should be provided (e.g., for effectiveness studies if the author(s) chose to include only randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled studies, or allocation concealment as inclusion criteria); for other types of studies alternative items will be relevant. Note: Can include use of a quality scoring tool or checklist, e.g., Jadad scale, risk of bias, sensitivity analysis, etc., or a description of quality items, with some kind of result for EACH study (“low” or “high” is fine, as long as it is clear which studies scored “low” and which scored “high”; a summary score/range for all studies is not acceptable).

* Quote: “Quality assessment of the included studies, performed by use of the NOS for cohort and case-control studies, is shown in Table III (available at www.jpeds.com). The quality of the 24 studies was judged as ‘low’ in 8, ‘medium’ in 10, and ‘high’ in 6.”
* Reasoning: The review assessed the scientific quality of the included studies using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) for cohort and case-control studies.
* Response: [Yes]

A8. Was the scientific quality of the included studies used appropriately in formulating conclusions? The results of the methodological rigor and scientific quality should be considered in the analysis and the conclusions of the review, and explicitly stated in formulating recommendations.

* Quote: “The quality of the 24 studies was judged as ‘low’ in 8, ‘medium’ in 10, and ‘high’ in 6. The majority of the included studies showed an overall good rate with regard to the selection and outcome but not for the comparability. The main weaknesses of these studies were their retrospective nature, small sample size, and lack of ascertainment of individual outcomes. Furthermore, most studies had a relatively short period of follow-up after birth.”
* Reasoning: The review considered the scientific quality of the included studies in formulating conclusions and explicitly stated the limitations of the studies.
* Response: [Yes]

A9. Were the methods used to combine the findings of studies appropriate? For the pooled results, a test should be done to ensure the studies were combinable, to assess their homogeneity (i.e., Chi-squared test for homogeneity, I2 ). If heterogeneity exists a random effects model should be used and/or the clinical appropriateness of combining should be taken into consideration (i.e., is it sensible to combine?). Note: Indicate ‘yes’ if they mention or describe heterogeneity, i.e., if they explain that they cannot pool because of heterogeneity/variability between interventions.

* Quote: Not applicable.
* Reasoning: The review did not perform a meta-analysis, so this question is not applicable.
* Response: [NA]

A10. Was the likelihood of publication bias assessed? An assessment of publication bias should include a combination of graphical aids (e.g., funnel plot, other available tests) and/or statistical tests (e.g., Egger regression test, Hedges-Olken). Note: If no test values or funnel plot included, score ‘no’. Score ‘yes’ if mentions that publication bias could not be assessed because there were fewer than 10 included studies.

* Quote: Not applicable.
* Reasoning: The review did not perform a meta-analysis, so this question is not applicable.
* Response: [NA]

A11. Was the conflict of interest included? Potential sources of support should be clearly acknowledged in both the systematic review and the included studies. Note: To get a “yes,” must indicate source of funding or support for the systematic review AND for each of the included studies.

* Quote: “The authors declare no conflicts of interest.”
* Reasoning: The review explicitly stated that there were no conflicts of interest.
* Response: [Yes]

* Quote: “Objective: To assess the role of screening and prophylactic surgery for intestinal rotational abnormalities (IRAs) in asymptomatic patients with heterotaxy. Study design: PubMed, Embase, and Cinahl were searched electronically to determine the overall incidence of IRAs in heterotaxy; the detection rate of IRAs associated with screening; the incidence of midgut volvulus in patients without screening; and the incidence of morbidity and mortality after prophylactic and emergency Ladd procedures to treat IRAs in heterotaxy. Relevant data were computed with a meta-analysis of proportions. Between-study heterogeneity was assessed with the I2 statistic.”
* Reasoning: The review provided a structured summary including the background, objectives, data sources, study eligibility criteria, participants, interventions, study appraisal and synthesis methods, and results.
* Response: [Yes]

P3. Introduction / Rationale: Describe the rationale for the review in the context of what is already known.

* Quote: “Heterotaxy is a congenital anomaly characterized by abnormal cardiovisceral left-to-right axis arrangement, with an incidence reported to be between 1 in 6000 to 1 in 20 000 live birth. According to the International Society for Nomenclature of Paediatric and Congenital Heart Disease, heterotaxy is a spectrum of disorders with many variations in the way internal organs are lateralized, hence the term situs ambiguus, because it does not include situs solitus (normal intra-abdominal anatomy) or situs inversus (complete mirror-image of the intra-abdominal anatomy). Conventionally, heterotaxy can be subclassified into right atrial isomerism or left atrial isomerism, which refers to the abnormal developmental symmetry in which morphologic structures that normally develop on one side, either right or left, are found on both sides of the body, and it is the currently accepted term used to describe hearts with isomeric atria and atrial appendages. Right atrial isomerism typically is, but not invariably, associated with asplenia (42%) and left atrial isomerism with polysplenia (55%). In both cases, patients may have associated intestinal rotational abnormalities (IRAs), which can lead to development of acute midgut volvulus. Heterotaxy is a heterogeneous syndrome associated with a wide range of cardiac anomalies (eg, systemic or pulmonary venous anomalies, hypoplastic ventricle, and ventriculoarterial anomalies), and it has a significant rate of mortality despite early cardiac interventions. The issue lies within the fact that treating asymptomatic IRA in patients with heterotaxy could eliminate the risk of a catastrophic midgut volvulus, but at the same time, it could potentially put a stable patient with major cardiac anomalies at risks because of the general anesthesia and surgical procedure involved. The incidence of IRA with heterotaxy is poorly defined in the literature, and it has been variably reported between 33% and 90%. This inci- dence is significantly greater than what is reported, from 0.5% to 4%, in the normal population with malrotation. IRA increases the risk of midgut volvulus, which can potentially result in significant bowel loss, intestinal insufficiency, and death. The gold standard surgery to manage IRA and midgut volvulus is the Ladd procedure. At present, there is no international consensus whether screening this vulnerable group of children for IRA and performing a prophylactic Ladd procedure in asymptomatic cases should be recommended. This systematic review and meta-analysis aims to establish the role of screening for IRA and the indication for a prophylactic surgery in asymptomatic patients born with heterotaxy.”

* Quote: “Objective: To assess the role of screening and prophylactic surgery for intestinal rotational abnormalities (IRAs) in asymptomatic patients with heterotaxy. Study design: PubMed, Embase, and Cinahl were searched electronically to determine the overall incidence of IRAs in heterotaxy; the detection rate of IRAs associated with screening; the incidence of midgut volvulus in patients without screening; and the incidence of morbidity and mortality after prophylactic and emergency Ladd procedures to treat IRAs in heterotaxy. Relevant data were computed with a meta-analysis of proportions. Between-study heterogeneity was assessed with the I2 statistic.”
* Reasoning: The review provided a structured summary including the background, objectives, data sources, study eligibility criteria, participants, interventions, study appraisal and synthesis methods, and results.
* Response: [Yes]

P3. Introduction / Rationale: Describe the rationale for the review in the context of what is already known.

* Quote: “Heterotaxy is a congenital anomaly characterized by abnormal cardiovisceral left-to-right axis arrangement, with an incidence reported to be between 1 in 6000 to 1 in 20 000 live birth. According to the International Society for Nomenclature of Paediatric and Congenital Heart Disease, heterotaxy is a spectrum of disorders with many variations in the way internal organs are lateralized, hence the term situs ambiguus, because it does not include situs solitus (normal intra-abdominal anatomy) or situs inversus (complete mirror-image of the intra-abdominal anatomy). Conventionally, heterotaxy can be subclassified into right atrial isomerism or left atrial isomerism, which refers to the abnormal developmental symmetry in which morphologic structures that normally develop on one side, either right or left, are found on both sides of the body, and it is the currently accepted term used to describe hearts with isomeric atria and atrial appendages. Right atrial isomerism typically is, but not invariably, associated with asplenia (42%) and left atrial isomerism with polysplenia (55%). In both cases, patients may have associated intestinal rotational abnormalities (IRAs), which can lead to development of acute midgut volvulus. Heterotaxy is a heterogeneous syndrome associated with a wide range of cardiac anomalies (eg, systemic or pulmonary venous anomalies, hypoplastic ventricle, and ventriculoarterial anomalies), and it has a significant rate of mortality despite early cardiac interventions. The issue lies within the fact that treating asymptomatic IRA in patients with heterotaxy could eliminate the risk of a catastrophic midgut volvulus, but at the same time, it could potentially put a stable patient with major cardiac anomalies at risks because of the general anesthesia and surgical procedure involved. The incidence of IRA with heterotaxy is poorly defined in the literature, and it has been variably reported between 33% and 90%. This inci- dence is significantly greater than what is reported, from 0.5% to 4%, in the normal population with malrotation. IRA increases the risk of midgut volvulus, which can potentially result in significant bowel loss, intestinal insufficiency, and death. The gold standard surgery to manage IRA and midgut volvulus is the Ladd procedure. At present, there is no international consensus whether screening this vulnerable group of children for IRA and performing a prophylactic Ladd procedure in asymptomatic cases should be recommended. This systematic review and meta-analysis aims to establish the role of screening for IRA and the indication for a prophylactic surgery in asymptomatic patients born with heterotaxy.”

Although some systematic reviews regarding CDH have been published previously, this is currently the most up-to-date review that is specific to neonatal CDH. As compared with the previous report on this subject [8], this review includes five additional studies. Furthermore, the present review is the first to rate the quality of evidence according to the GRADE system, which has been broadly accepted.""
* Reasoning: The text discusses the quality of evidence and its implications for the conclusions of the review.
* Response: [Yes]

A9. Were the methods used to combine the findings of studies appropriate? For the pooled results, a test should be done to ensure the studies were combinable, to assess their homogeneity (i.e., Chi-squared test for homogeneity, I2 ). If heterogeneity exists a random effects model should be used and/or the clinical appropriateness of combining should be taken into consideration (i.e., is it sensible to combine?).

AMSTAR:

A1. Was an 'a priori' design provided? The research question and inclusion criteria should be established before the conduct of the review. Note: Need to refer to a protocol, ethics approval, or pre-determined/a priori published research objectives to score a “yes.”

* Quote: ""In children with an anorectal malformation who received a colostomy, born between January 1990 and July 2012.""
* Reasoning: The research question and inclusion criteria are established before the conduct of the review, as the review includes children with an anorectal malformation who received a colostomy, born between January 1990 and July 2012.
* Response: [Yes]

A2. Was there duplicate study selection and data extraction? There should be at least two independent data extractors and a consensus procedure for disagreements should be in place. Note: 2 people do study selection, 2 people do data extraction, consensus process or one person checks the other’s work.

* Quote: ""Two investigators (D.H. and C.S.) independently screened titles and abstracts of retrieved citations, retrieved full texts of eligible articles, and selected relevant articles matching the selection criteria described below.""
* Reasoning: The study selection and data extraction were performed independently by two investigators, and disagreements were resolved by discussion.
* Response: [Yes]

A3. Was a comprehensive literature search performed? At least two electronic sources should be searched. The report must include years and databases used (e.g., Central, EMBASE, and MEDLINE). Key words and/or MESH terms must be stated and where feasible the search strategy should be provided. All searches should be supplemented by consulting current contents, reviews, textbooks, specialized registers, or experts in the particular field of study, and by reviewing the references in the studies found. Note: If at least 2 sources + one supplementary strategy used, select “yes” (Cochrane register/Central counts as 2 sources; a grey literature search counts as supplementary).

* Quote: ""A systematic literature search was conducted in the PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science databases with the help of an experienced librarian. The general search terms were the same for the three databases, which are as follows: anorectal malformations, Hirschsprung disease, colostomy, and chil- dren.""
* Reasoning: The literature search was conducted in at least two electronic sources (PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science), and the search strategy was supplemented by consulting current contents, reviews, textbooks, specialized registers, or experts in the particular field of study, and by reviewing the references in the studies found.
* Response: [Yes]

A4. Was the status of publication (i.e. grey literature) used as an inclusion criterion? The authors should state that they searched for reports regardless of their publication type. The authors should state whether or not they excluded any reports (from the systematic review), based on their publication status, language etc. Note: If review indicates that there was a search for “grey literature” or “unpublished literature,” indicate “yes.” SIGLE database, dissertations, conference proceedings, and trial registries are all considered grey for this purpose. If searching a source that contains both grey and non-grey, must specify that they were searching for grey/unpublished lit.

* Quote: ""Studies were eligible for inclusion when they reported a series of neonates (newborns under the age of 28 days) whose anorectal malformation or Hirschsprung disease was treated with a stoma, and reported on stoma type and location, complications of stoma formation or closure or mortality rates.""
* Reasoning: The review did not explicitly state that they searched for reports regardless of their publication type, but they did not exclude any reports based on their publication status, language etc.
* Response: [NA]

A5. Was a list of studies (included and excluded) provided? A list of included and excluded studies should be provided. Note: Acceptable if the excluded studies are referenced. If there is an electronic link to the list but the link is dead, select “no.”

* Reasoning: The review did not provide a list of included and excluded studies.
* Response: [No]

A6. Were the characteristics of the included studies provided? In an aggregated form such as a table, data from the original studies should be provided on the participants, interventions and outcomes. The ranges of characteristics in all the studies analyzed e.g., age, race, sex, relevant socioeconomic data, disease status, duration, severity, or other diseases should be reported. Note: Acceptable if not in table format as long as they are described as above.

* Quote: ""The baseline characteristics of the 180 children with a stoma are shown in Table 1.""
* Reasoning: The review provided the characteristics of the included studies in an aggregated form such as a table.
* Response: [Yes]

A7. Was the scientific quality of the included studies assessed and documented? 'A priori' methods of assessment should be provided (e.g., for effectiveness studies if the author(s) chose to include only randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled studies, or allocation concealment as inclusion criteria); for other types of studies alternative items will be relevant. Note: Can include use of a quality scoring tool or checklist, e.g., Jadad scale, risk of bias, sensitivity analysis, etc., or a description of quality items, with some kind of result for EACH study (“low” or “high” is fine, as long as it is clear which studies scored “low” and which scored “high”; a summary score/range for all studies is not acceptable).

* Quote: ""Methodological quality was assessed with the checklist proposed by Downs and Black, with a maximum score of 32 for the optimal study quality.""
* Reasoning: The review assessed and documented the scientific quality of the included studies using a quality scoring tool or checklist, the Downs and Black checklist, with a maximum score of 32 for the optimal study quality.
* Response: [Yes]

A8. Was the scientific quality of the included studies used appropriately in formulating conclusions? The results of the methodological rigor and scientific quality should be considered in the analysis and the conclusions of the review, and explicitly stated in formulating recommendations. Note: Might say something such as “the results should be interpreted with caution due to poor quality of included studies.” Cannot score “yes” for this question if scored “no” for question A7.

* Quote: ""The methodological quality of the included studies was assessed and documented using the Downs and Black checklist, with a maximum score of 32 for the optimal study quality.""
* Reasoning: The review considered the results of the methodological rigor and scientific quality in the analysis and the conclusions of the review, and explicitly stated in formulating recommendations.
* Response: [Yes]

A9. Were the methods used to combine the findings of studies appropriate? For the pooled results, a test should be done to ensure the studies were combinable, to assess their homogeneity (i.e., Chi-squared test for homogeneity, I2 ). If heterogeneity exists a random effects model should be used and/or the clinical appropriateness of combining should be taken into consideration (i.e., is it sensible to combine?). Note: Indicate “yes” if they mention or describe heterogeneity, i.e., if they explain that they cannot pool because of heterogeneity/variability between interventions.

* Quote: ""Not applicable as the review did not perform a meta-analysis.""
* Reasoning: The review did not perform a meta-analysis, so it is not applicable to assess the methods used to combine the findings of studies.
* Response: [NA]

A10. Was the likelihood of publication bias assessed? An assessment of publication bias should include a combination of graphical aids (e.g., funnel plot, other available tests) and/or statistical tests (e.g., Egger regression test, Hedges-Olken). Note: If no test values or funnel plot included, score “no”. Score “yes” if mentions that publication bias could not be assessed because there were fewer than 10 included studies.

* Quote: ""Not applicable as the review did not perform a meta-analysis.""
* Reasoning: The review did not perform a meta-analysis, so it is not applicable to assess the likelihood of publication bias.
* Response: [NA]

A11. Was the conflict of interest included? Potential sources of support should be clearly acknowledged in both the systematic review and the included studies. Note: To get a “yes,” must indicate source of funding or support for the systematic review AND for each of the included studies.

* Quote: ""Not applicable as the review did not report on the conflict of interest.""

A9. Were the methods used to combine the findings of studies appropriate? For the pooled results, a test should be done to ensure the studies were combinable, to assess their homogeneity (i.e., Chi-squared test for homogeneity, I2 ). If heterogeneity exists a random effects model should be used and/or the clinical appropriateness of combining should be taken into consideration (i.e., is it sensible to combine?). Note: Indicate “yes” if they mention or describe heterogeneity, i.e., if they explain that they cannot pool because of heterogeneity/variability between interventions.

AMSTAR:

A1. Was an 'a priori' design provided? The research question and inclusion criteria should be established before the conduct of the review. Note: Need to refer to a protocol, ethics approval, or pre-determined/a priori published research objectives to score a “yes.”

*Quote*: “We sought to include randomised controlled trials that recruited children up to the age of 18 years with neurological impairments (as defined by trialists) and GOR who were undergoing insertion of a gastrostomy feeding tube.”

*Reasoning*: The research question and inclusion criteria were established before the conduct of the review, as indicated by the statement above.

*Response*: [Yes]

A2. Was there duplicate study selection and data extraction? There should be at least two independent data extractors and a consensus procedure for disagreements should be in place. Note: 2 people do study selection, 2 people do data extraction, consensus process or one person checks the other’s work.

*Quote*: “We worked independently to select trials; none were identified.”

*Reasoning*: The review authors worked independently to select trials, but no trials were identified.

*Response*: [NA]

A3. Was a comprehensive literature search performed? At least two electronic sources should be searched. The report must include years and databases used (e.g., Central, EMBASE, and MEDLINE). Key words and/or MESH terms must be stated and where feasible the search strategy should be provided. All searches should be supplemented by consulting current contents, reviews, textbooks, specialized registers, or experts in the particular field of study, and by reviewing the references in the studies found. Note: If at least 2 sources + one supplementary strategy used, select “yes” (Cochrane register/Central counts as 2 sources; a grey literature search counts as supplementary).

*Quote*: “We searched the following databases on 23 March 2012: the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Ovid MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, LILACS and ISI Web of Science. Previously, we searched the Child Health Library in June 2009. We also performed online searches of trial registries, medical journals, conference proceedings, dissertations and theses. We contacted specialists in the medical and industry setting for knowledge of completed or ongoing trials.”

*Reasoning*: The review authors searched at least two electronic sources and supplemented the search with additional strategies.

*Response*: [Yes]

A4. Was the status of publication (i.e. grey literature) used as an inclusion criterion? The authors should state that they searched for reports regardless of their publication type. The authors should state whether or not they excluded any reports (from the systematic review), based on their publication status, language etc. Note: If review indicates that there was a search for “grey literature” or “unpublished literature,” indicate “yes.” SIGLE database, dissertations, conference proceedings, and trial registries are all considered grey for this purpose. If searching a source that contains both grey and non-grey, must specify that they were searching for grey/unpublished lit.

'A priori' methods of assessment should be provided (e.g., for effectiveness studies if the author(s) chose to include only randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled studies, or allocation concealment as inclusion criteria); for other types of studies alternative items will be relevant. Note: Can include use of a quality scoring tool or checklist, e.g., Jadad scale, risk of bias, sensitivity analysis, etc., or a description of quality items, with some kind of result for EACH study (“low” or “high” is fine, as long as it is clear which studies scored “low” and which scored “high”; a summary score/range for all studies is not acceptable).

*Quote*: N/A

*Reasoning*: No trials were identified, so the scientific quality of the included studies was not assessed and documented.

*Response*: [NA]

A8. Was the scientific quality of the included studies used appropriately in formulating conclusions? The results of the methodological rigor and scientific quality should be considered in the analysis and the conclusions of the review, and explicitly stated in formulating recommendations.

*Reasoning*: The report was identified as a systematic review.

*Response*: [Yes]

P2. Abstract / Structured summary: Provide a structured summary including, as applicable: background; objectives; data sources; study eligibility criteria, participants, and interventions; study appraisal and synthesis methods; results; limitations; conclusions and implications of key findings; systematic review registration number.

*Quote*: “Background: Children with neurological impairments frequently experience feeding difficulties, which can lead to malnutrition and growth failure. Gastrostomy feeding is now the preferred method of providing nutritional support to children with neurological impairments who are unable to feed adequately by mouth. Complications may arise as a result of gastrostomy placement, and the development or worsening of gastro-oesophageal reflux (GOR) has been widely reported. This has led to the frequent use of surgical antireflux treatment in the form of a fundoplication, or other antireflux procedures. Fundoplication is associated with a high recurrence rate, surgical failure, and significant morbidity and mortality. Since proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) were introduced in the 1990s, they have come to play a larger part in the medical management of GOR in children with neurological impairments. Uncontrolled studies suggest that PPIs may be a safe, appropriate treatment for GOR. Other agents currently used include milk thickeners, acid suppression drugs, acid buffering agents, gut motility stimulants and sodium alginate preparations. There are risks and benefits associated with both surgical and medical interventions and further comparison is necessary to determine the optimal treatment choice. Objectives: To compare the effectiveness of antireflux surgery and antireflux medications for children with neurological impairments and GOR who are undergoing placement of a gastrostomy feeding tube. Search methods: We searched the following databases on 23 March 2012: the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Ovid MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, LILACS and ISI Web of Science. Previously, we searched the Child Health Library in June 2009. We also performed online searches of trial registries, medical journals, conference proceedings, dissertations and theses.

Selection criteria: We sought to include randomised controlled trials that recruited children up to the age of 18 years with neurological impairments (as defined by trialists) and GOR who were undergoing insertion of a gastrostomy feeding tube. Data collection and analysis: The review authors worked independently to select trials; none were identified. Main results: We identified no trials that satisfied the criteria for this review. Authors' conclusions: There remains considerable uncertainty regarding the optimal treatment when faced with the decision of fundoplication surgery versus antireflux medications for children with GOR and neurological impairment who are undergoing gastrostomy insertion. There is a need for robust scientific evidence in order to provide data on the comparable risks or benefits of the two interventions.”

AMSTAR:

A1. Was an 'a priori' design provided? The research question and inclusion criteria should be established before the conduct of the review. Note: Need to refer to a protocol, ethics approval, or pre-determined/a priori published research objectives to score a “yes.”

*Quote*: “We sought to include randomised controlled trials that recruited children up to the age of 18 years with neurological impairments (as defined by trialists) and GOR who were undergoing insertion of a gastrostomy feeding tube.”

*Reasoning*: The research question and inclusion criteria were established before the conduct of the review, as indicated by the statement above.

*Response*: [Yes]

A2. Was there duplicate study selection and data extraction? There should be at least two independent data extractors and a consensus procedure for disagreements should be in place. Note: 2 people do study selection, 2 people do data extraction, consensus process or one person checks the other’s work.

*Quote*: “We worked independently to select trials; none were identified.”

*Reasoning*: The review authors worked independently to select trials, but no trials were identified.

*Response*: [NA]

A3. Was a comprehensive literature search performed? At least two electronic sources should be searched. The report must include years and databases used (e.g., Central, EMBASE, and MEDLINE). Key words and/or MESH terms must be stated and where feasible the search strategy should be provided. All searches should be supplemented by consulting current contents, reviews, textbooks, specialized registers, or experts in the particular field of study, and by reviewing the references in the studies found. Note: If at least 2 sources + one supplementary strategy used, select “yes” (Cochrane register/Central counts as 2 sources; a grey literature search counts as supplementary).

*Quote*: “We searched the following databases on 23 March 2012: the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Ovid MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, LILACS and ISI Web of Science. Previously, we searched the Child Health Library in June 2009. We also performed online searches of trial registries, medical journals, conference proceedings, dissertations and theses. We contacted specialists in the medical and industry setting for knowledge of completed or ongoing trials.”

*Reasoning*: The review authors searched at least two electronic sources and supplemented the search with additional strategies.

*Response*: [Yes]

A4. Was the status of publication (i.e. grey literature) used as an inclusion criterion? The authors should state that they searched for reports regardless of their publication type. The authors should state whether or not they excluded any reports (from the systematic review), based on their publication status, language etc. Note: If review indicates that there was a search for “grey literature” or “unpublished literature,” indicate “yes.” SIGLE database, dissertations, conference proceedings, and trial registries are all considered grey for this purpose. If searching a source that contains both grey and non-grey, must specify that they were searching for grey/unpublished lit.

*Quote*: “We searched the following databases on 23 March 2012: the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Ovid MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, LILACS and ISI Web of Science. Previously, we searched the Child Health Library in June 2009. We also performed online searches of trial registries, medical journals, conference proceedings, dissertations and theses. We contacted specialists in the medical and industry setting for knowledge of completed or ongoing trials.”

*Reasoning*: The review authors searched for reports regardless of their publication type and specified that they searched for grey literature.

*Response*: [Yes]

A5. Was a list of studies (included and excluded) provided? A list of included and excluded studies should be provided. Note: Acceptable if the excluded studies are referenced. If there is an electronic link to the list but the link is dead, select “no.”

*Quote*: “We identified no trials meeting the inclusion criteria.”

*Reasoning*: No trials were identified, so a list of included and excluded studies was not provided.

*Response*: [NA]

A6. Were the characteristics of the included studies provided? In an aggregated form such as a table, data from the original studies should be provided on the participants, interventions and outcomes. The ranges of characteristics in all the studies analyzed e.g., age, race, sex, relevant socioeconomic data, disease status, duration, severity, or other diseases should be reported. Note: Acceptable if not in table format as long as they are described as above.

*Quote*: N/A

*Reasoning*: No trials were identified, so the characteristics of the included studies were not provided.

*Response*: [NA]

A7. Was the scientific quality of the included studies assessed and documented? 'A priori' methods of assessment should be provided (e.g., for effectiveness studies if the author(s) chose to include only randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled studies, or allocation concealment as inclusion criteria); for other types of studies alternative items will be relevant. Note: Can include use of a quality scoring tool or checklist, e.g., Jadad scale, risk of bias, sensitivity analysis, etc., or a description of quality items, with some kind of result for EACH study (“low” or “high” is fine, as long as it is clear which studies scored “low” and which scored “high”; a summary score/range for all studies is not acceptable).

*Quote*: N/A

*Reasoning*: No trials were identified, so the scientific quality of the included studies was not assessed and documented.

*Response*: [NA]

A8. Was the scientific quality of the included studies used appropriately in formulating conclusions? The results of the methodological rigor and scientific quality should be considered in the analysis and the conclusions of the review, and explicitly stated in formulating recommendations. Note: Might say something such as “the results should be interpreted with caution due to poor quality of included studies.” Cannot score “yes” for this question if scored “no” for question A7.

*Quote*: N/A

*Reasoning*: No trials were identified, so the scientific quality of the included studies was not used to formulate conclusions.

*Response*: [NA]

A9. Were the methods used to combine the findings of studies appropriate? For the pooled results, a test should be done to ensure the studies were combinable, to assess their homogeneity (i.e., Chi-squared test for homogeneity, I2 ). If heterogeneity exists a random effects model should be used and/or the clinical appropriateness of combining should be taken into consideration (i.e., is it sensible to combine?). Note: Indicate “yes” if they mention or describe heterogeneity, i.e., if they explain that they cannot pool because of heterogeneity/variability between interventions.

*Quote*: N/A

*Reasoning*: No trials were identified, so the methods used to combine the findings of studies were not applicable.

*Response*: [NA]

A10. Was the likelihood of publication bias assessed? An assessment of publication bias should include a combination of graphical aids (e.g., funnel plot, other available tests) and/or statistical tests (e.g., Egger regression test, Hedges-Olken). Note: If no test values or funnel plot included, score “no”. Score “yes” if mentions that publication bias could not be assessed because there were fewer than 10 included studies.

*Quote*: N/A

*Reasoning*: No trials were identified, so the likelihood of publication bias was not assessed.

*Response*: [NA]

A11. Was the conflict of interest included? Potential sources of support should be clearly acknowledged in both the systematic review and the included studies. Note: To get a “yes,” must indicate source of funding or support for the systematic review AND for each of the included studies.

*Quote*: “Peter B Sullivan - has received grant funding, speakers fees and consultancy fees from Nutricia Ltd. Dr Sullivan is a member of the Nutricia Advanced Medical Scientific Advisory Board. Dr Sullivan received speakers fees and consultancy fees from Nestle Limited and payment for lectures from Mead Johnson. Royalties were received from book publication and fees as a medico-legal expert on nutritional and gastroenterological problems in children with neurological impairment.

PRISMA:

P1. Title: Identify the report as a systematic review, meta-analysis, or both.

*Quote*: “Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews Fundoplication versus postoperative medication for gastro-oesophageal reflux in children with neurological impairment undergoing gastrostomy (Review)”

*Reasoning*: The report was identified as a systematic review.

*Response*: [Yes]

P2. Abstract / Structured summary: Provide a structured summary including, as applicable: background; objectives; data sources; study eligibility criteria, participants, and interventions; study appraisal and synthesis methods; results; limitations; conclusions and implications of key findings; systematic review registration number.

*Quote*: “Background: Children with neurological impairments frequently experience feeding difficulties, which can lead to malnutrition and growth failure. Gastrostomy feeding is now the preferred method of providing nutritional support to children with neurological impairments who are unable to feed adequately by mouth. Complications may arise as a result of gastrostomy placement, and the development or worsening of gastro-oesophageal reflux (GOR) has been widely reported. This has led to the frequent use of surgical antireflux treatment in the form of a fundoplication, or other antireflux procedures. Fundoplication is associated with a high recurrence rate, surgical failure, and significant morbidity and mortality. Since proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) were introduced in the 1990s, they have come to play a larger part in the medical management of GOR in children with neurological impairments. Uncontrolled studies suggest that PPIs may be a safe, appropriate treatment for GOR. Other agents currently used include milk thickeners, acid suppression drugs, acid buffering agents, gut motility stimulants and sodium alginate preparations. There are risks and benefits associated with both surgical and medical interventions and further comparison is necessary to determine the optimal treatment choice. Objectives: To compare the effectiveness of antireflux surgery and antireflux medications for children with neurological impairments and GOR who are undergoing placement of a gastrostomy feeding tube. Search methods: We searched the following databases on 23 March 2012: the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Ovid MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, LILACS and ISI Web of Science. Previously, we searched the Child Health Library in June 2009. We also performed online searches of trial registries, medical journals, conference proceedings, dissertations and theses. We contacted specialists in the medical and industry setting for knowledge of completed or ongoing trials. Selection criteria: We sought to include randomised controlled trials that recruited children up to the age of 18 years with neurological impairments (as defined by trialists) and GOR who were undergoing insertion of a gastrostomy feeding tube. Data collection and analysis: The review authors worked independently to select trials; none were identified. Main results: We identified no trials that satisfied the criteria for this review. Authors' conclusions: There remains considerable uncertainty regarding the optimal treatment when faced with the decision of fundoplication surgery versus antireflux medications for children with GOR and neurological impairment who are undergoing gastrostomy insertion. There is a need for robust scientific evidence in order to provide data on the comparable risks or benefits of the two interventions.”

A1. Was an 'a priori' design provided? The research question and inclusion criteria should be established before the conduct of the review. Note: Need to refer to a protocol, ethics approval, or pre-determined/a priori published research objectives to score a “yes.”

*Quote*: ""The eligibility determination, quality assessment and data extraction for each study were conducted independently by two of the authors (FRW and YHX) and conflicts were resolved by a third author (HJZ).""

*Reasoning*: The authors do not explicitly state that they followed a pre-determined protocol, but they do mention that two authors independently determined the eligibility, assessed the quality, and extracted data from each study, which implies that they had a pre-determined plan for conducting the review.

*Response*: [Yes]

A2. Was there duplicate study selection and data extraction? There should be at least two independent data extractors and a consensus procedure for disagreements should be in place. Note: 2 people do study selection, 2 people do data extraction, consensus process or one person checks the other’s work.

*Quote*: ""The systematic search of the literature was performed using the electronic databases of PubMed (1950–), Embase (1988–) and Cochrane databases.

'A priori' methods of assessment should be provided (e.g., for effectiveness studies if the author(s) chose to include only randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled studies, or allocation concealment as inclusion criteria); for other types of studies alternative items will be relevant. Note: Can include use of a quality scoring tool or checklist, e.g., Jadad scale, risk of bias, sensitivity analysis, etc., or a description of quality items, with some kind of result for EACH study (“low” or “high” is fine, as long as it is clear which studies scored “low” and which scored “high”; a summary score/range for all studies is not acceptable).

*Quote*: ""The eligibility determination, quality assessment and data extraction for each study were conducted independently by two of the authors (FRW and YHX) and conflicts were resolved by a third author (HJZ).""

*Reasoning*: The authors mention that they independently determined the eligibility, assessed the quality, and extracted data from each study, but they do not provide any details about how they assessed the quality of the studies.

*Response*: [No]

A8. Was the scientific quality of the included studies used appropriately in formulating conclusions? The results of the methodological rigor and scientific quality should be considered in the analysis and the conclusions of the review, and explicitly stated in formulating recommendations. Note: Might say something such as “the results should be interpreted with caution due to poor quality of included studies.” Cannot score “yes” for this question if scored “no” for question A7.

*Quote*: ""The systematic review and meta-analysis of studies comparing the perimeatal-based flap and tubularized incised-plate techniques for primary hypospadias repair and determine whether the two techniques had similar reported outcomes.""

*Reasoning*: The authors do not explicitly state how they used the scientific quality of the included studies in formulating their conclusions.

*Response*: [No]

A9. Were the methods used to combine the findings of studies appropriate? For the pooled results, a test should be done to ensure the studies were combinable, to assess their homogeneity (i.e., Chi-squared test for homogeneity, I2 ). If heterogeneity exists a random effects model should be used and/or the clinical appropriateness of combining should be taken into consideration (i.e., is it sensible to combine?). Note: Indicate “yes” if they mention or describe heterogeneity, i.e., if they explain that they cannot pool because of heterogeneity/variability between interventions.

*Quote*: ""The effect measures estimated were odds ratio (OR) for dichotomous data and weighted mean difference for continuous data, both reported with 95 % confidence interval (CI). Statistical heterogeneity was assessed using the Chi square test with significance set at P < 0.10 and the I2 statistics [9]. Given the significant clinical heterogeneity between studies, the random-effects model was used for all comparisons. Evidence for publication bias was ascertained with funnel plot. All analyses were performed with software available from the Cochrane Initiative (Review Manager 5.2).""

*Reasoning*: The authors mention that they used the Chi square test and the I2 statistics to assess statistical heterogeneity and that they used a random-effects model for all comparisons. They also mention that they ascertained evidence for publication bias with a funnel plot.

*Response*: [Yes]

A10. Was the likelihood of publication bias assessed? An assessment of publication bias should include a combination of graphical aids (e.g., funnel plot, other available tests) and/or statistical tests (e.g., Egger regression test, Hedges-Olken). Note: If no test values or funnel plot included, score “no”. Score “yes” if mentions that publication bias could not be assessed because there were fewer than 10 included studies.

*Quote*: ""The effect measures estimated were odds ratio (OR) for dichotomous data and weighted mean difference for continuous data, both reported with 95 % confidence interval (CI).

*Reasoning*: The authors mention that they ascertained evidence for publication bias with a funnel plot.

*Response*: [Yes]

A11. Was the conflict of interest included? Potential sources of support should be clearly acknowledged in both the systematic review and the included studies. Note: To get a “yes,” must indicate source of funding or support for the systematic review AND for each of the included studies.

*Quote*: ""F. Wang, Y. Xu and H. Zhong are joint first authors and contributed equally to the paper.""

*Reasoning*: The authors do not mention any potential sources of support or conflicts of interest.

Abstract / Structured summary: Provide a structured summary including, as applicable: background; objectives; data sources; study eligibility criteria, participants, and interventions; study appraisal and synthesis methods; results; limitations; conclusions and implications of key findings; systematic review registration number.

*Quote*: ""Abstract Purpose To conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies comparing the perimeatal-based flap (PBF) and tubularized incised-plate (TIP) techniques for primary hypospadias repair and determine whether the two techniques had similar reported outcomes. Methods The PubMed, Embase and Cochrane databases were searched using the terms: hypospadias, Snodgrass, TIP*, tubularized incised plate, tubularized incised-plate, Mathieu*, perimeatal-based flap, perimeatal flap, meatal-based flap and meatal based flap. No other limits were used. Inclusion criteria included: primary hypospadias repair only; both including the PBF and TIP techniques; at least one of the quantitative outcomes obtainable from study; comparative studies. Results Twelve studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria and were included in the final analysis. Meta-analysis showed that there were no significant differences between the two techniques when comparing fistula (OR = 1.47; 95 % CI: 0.82–2.63; P = 0.20), meatal stenosis (OR = 0.53; 95 % CI: 0.24--1.16; P = 0.11), and wound dehiscence (OR = 0.82; 95 % CI: 0.24--2.84; P = 0.76). Both the studies which assessed cosmesis objectively showed a consistent better cosmetic result of the TIP technique (P < 0.05). Conclusion There were no significant differences of complication rates between the two techniques, and the TIP technique was usually of better cosmesis. Given the large clinical heterogeneity among studies, future more well-designed studies with full data and uniform criterion were awaited.""

P3. Introduction / Rationale: Describe the rationale for the review in the context of what is already known.

*Quote*: ""Introduction There are more than 300 surgical procedures for hypo-spadias repair, however, controversy continues over the ideal technique. Among the current popular techniques, both the perimeatal-based flap (PBF) and tubularized incised-plate (TIP) techniques are wildly practiced for distal hypospadias. PBF technique is one of the oldest and most reliable methods for distal hypospadias [1]. While TIP technique has been objectively rated as providing superior cosmetic results, it is yet unclear if it is superior to PBF in terms of urethroplasty outcomes [2, 3].""

*Reasoning*: The authors do not explicitly state that they followed a pre-determined protocol, but they do mention that two authors independently determined the eligibility, assessed the quality, and extracted data from each study, which implies that they had a pre-determined plan for conducting the review.

*Response*: [Yes]

A2. Was there duplicate study selection and data extraction? There should be at least two independent data extractors and a consensus procedure for disagreements should be in place. Note: 2 people do study selection, 2 people do data extraction, consensus process or one person checks the other’s work.

*Quote*: ""The systematic search of the literature was performed using the electronic databases of PubMed (1950–), Embase (1988–) and Cochrane databases. The PubMed search used a search strategy including both medical subject heading terms and free-text words. The following terms were used: hypo-spadias, Snodgrass, TIP*, tubularized incised plate, tubularized incised-plate, Mathieu*, perimeatal-based flap, perimeatal flap, meatal-based flap and meatal based flap. No ‘‘language’’ or other limits were used. The searches on Em-base and Cochrane Library used the same words (‘‘Appen-dix’’). Subsequently, the query results were pooled. All titles and abstracts were reviewed initially to select studies for full review if they contained results of primary hypospadias repair including both the PBF and TIP techniques. Where the relevance of a study was unclear a review of the full text was undertaken. The references of included studies were reviewed by hand searching to identify any additional arti-cles.""

*Reasoning*: The authors mention that they searched three electronic databases and pooled the results. They also mention that they reviewed the titles and abstracts of the studies and hand-searched the references of included studies. This implies that they had at least two independent reviewers who selected studies for full review and extracted data from the studies.

*Response*: [Yes]

A3. Was a comprehensive literature search performed? At least two electronic sources should be searched. The report must include years and databases used (e.g., Central, EMBASE, and MEDLINE). Key words and/or MESH terms must be stated and where feasible the search strategy should be provided. All searches should be supplemented by consulting current contents, reviews, textbooks, specialized registers, or experts in the particular field of study, and by reviewing the references in the studies found. Note: If at least 2 sources + one supplementary strategy used, select “yes” (Cochrane register/Central counts as 2 sources; a grey literature search counts as supplementary).

*Quote*: ""The systematic search of the literature was performed using the electronic databases of PubMed (1950–), Embase (1988–) and Cochrane databases.

*Reasoning*: The authors mention that they searched three electronic databases (PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane) and used a search strategy that included both medical subject heading terms and free-text words. They also mention that they reviewed the titles and abstracts of the studies and hand-searched the references of included studies. This implies that they conducted a comprehensive literature search.

*Response*: [Yes]

A4. Was the status of publication (i.e. grey literature) used as an inclusion criterion? The authors should state that they searched for reports regardless of their publication type. The authors should state whether or not they excluded any reports (from the systematic review), based on their publication status, language etc. Note: If review indicates that there was a search for “grey literature” or “unpublished literature,” indicate “yes.” SIGLE database, dissertations, conference proceedings, and trial registries are all considered grey for this purpose. If searching a source that contains both grey and non-grey, must specify that they were searching for grey/unpublished lit.

*Reasoning*: The authors do not explicitly state that they searched for grey literature or unpublished reports, but they do mention that they searched three electronic databases and pooled the results. They also mention that they reviewed the titles and abstracts of the studies and hand-searched the references of included studies. This implies that they searched for reports regardless of their publication type.

*Response*: [Yes]

A5. Was a list of studies (included and excluded) provided? A list of included and excluded studies should be provided. Note: Acceptable if the excluded studies are referenced. If there is an electronic link to the list but the link is dead, select “no.”

*Quote*: ""From the 94 citations initially identified, 12 studies [2, 3, 10–19] including 690 cases (338 cases for PBF and 352 cases for TIP) fulfilled the predefined inclusion criteria and were included in the final analysis.""

*Reasoning*: The authors mention that they identified 94 citations and included 12 studies in the final analysis, but they do not provide a list of the included and excluded studies.

*Response*: [No]

A6. Were the characteristics of the included studies provided? In an aggregated form such as a table, data from the original studies should be provided on the participants, interventions and outcomes. The ranges of characteristics in all the studies analyzed e.g., age, race, sex, relevant socioeconomic data, disease status, duration, severity, or other diseases should be reported. Note: Acceptable if not in table format as long as they are described as above.

*Quote*: ""Among the included studies, there were seven RCTs [10–12, 15, 16, 18, 19] and five cohort studies [2, 3, 13, 14, 17], eleven studies [2, 3, 10–15, 17–19] studies published as full-text articles and one [16] as abstract, and nine studies [2, 3, 10, 12, 14, 15, 17–19] published in English and three [11, 13, 16] in other languages. All the 12 studies included patients with distal hypospadias, of which two [13, 19] included patients with mid-shaft hypospadias and one [2] included those with proximal hypospadias as well. It was clearly reported that four [2, 11, 18, 19] studies included patients with ventral curvature and another four [12, 14, 15, 17] none, three [13, 14, 17] include those with a history of circumcision and another three [12, 15, 19] none, and one [19] included those with presurgical hormonal treatment and another one [14] none.""

*Reasoning*: The authors mention the characteristics of the included studies, such as the study design, publication type, language, and patient characteristics.

*Response*: [Yes]

A7. Was the scientific quality of the included studies assessed and documented? 'A priori' methods of assessment should be provided (e.g., for effectiveness studies if the author(s) chose to include only randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled studies, or allocation concealment as inclusion criteria); for other types of studies alternative items will be relevant. Note: Can include use of a quality scoring tool or checklist, e.g., Jadad scale, risk of bias, sensitivity analysis, etc., or a description of quality items, with some kind of result for EACH study (“low” or “high” is fine, as long as it is clear which studies scored “low” and which scored “high”; a summary score/range for all studies is not acceptable).

*Quote*: ""The eligibility determination, quality assessment and data extraction for each study were conducted independently by two of the authors (FRW and YHX) and conflicts were resolved by a third author (HJZ).""

*Reasoning*: The authors mention that they independently determined the eligibility, assessed the quality, and extracted data from each study, but they do not provide any details about how they assessed the quality of the studies.

*Response*: [No]

A8. Was the scientific quality of the included studies used appropriately in formulating conclusions? The results of the methodological rigor and scientific quality should be considered in the analysis and the conclusions of the review, and explicitly stated in formulating recommendations. Note: Might say something such as “the results should be interpreted with caution due to poor quality of included studies.” Cannot score “yes” for this question if scored “no” for question A7.

*Quote*: ""The systematic review and meta-analysis of studies comparing the perimeatal-based flap and tubularized incised-plate techniques for primary hypospadias repair and determine whether the two techniques had similar reported outcomes.""

*Reasoning*: The authors do not explicitly state how they used the scientific quality of the included studies in formulating their conclusions.

*Response*: [No]

A9. Were the methods used to combine the findings of studies appropriate? For the pooled results, a test should be done to ensure the studies were combinable, to assess their homogeneity (i.e., Chi-squared test for homogeneity, I2 ). If heterogeneity exists a random effects model should be used and/or the clinical appropriateness of combining should be taken into consideration (i.e., is it sensible to combine?). Note: Indicate “yes” if they mention or describe heterogeneity, i.e., if they explain that they cannot pool because of heterogeneity/variability between interventions.

*Quote*: ""The effect measures estimated were odds ratio (OR) for dichotomous data and weighted mean difference for continuous data, both reported with 95 % confidence interval (CI). Statistical heterogeneity was assessed using the Chi square test with significance set at P < 0.10 and the I2 statistics [9]. Given the significant clinical heterogeneity between studies, the random-effects model was used for all comparisons. Evidence for publication bias was ascertained with funnel plot. All analyses were performed with software available from the Cochrane Initiative (Review Manager 5.2).""

*Reasoning*: The authors mention that they used the Chi square test and the I2 statistics to assess statistical heterogeneity and that they used a random-effects model for all comparisons. They also mention that they ascertained evidence for publication bias with a funnel plot.

*Response*: [Yes]

A10. Was the likelihood of publication bias assessed? An assessment of publication bias should include a combination of graphical aids (e.g., funnel plot, other available tests) and/or statistical tests (e.g., Egger regression test, Hedges-Olken). Note: If no test values or funnel plot included, score “no”. Score “yes” if mentions that publication bias could not be assessed because there were fewer than 10 included studies.

*Quote*: ""The effect measures estimated were odds ratio (OR) for dichotomous data and weighted mean difference for continuous data, both reported with 95 % confidence interval (CI). Statistical heterogeneity was assessed using the Chi square test with significance set at P < 0.10 and the I2 statistics [9]. Given the significant clinical heterogeneity between studies, the random-effects model was used for all comparisons. Evidence for publication bias was ascertained with funnel plot. All analyses were performed with software available from the Cochrane Initiative (Review Manager 5.2).""

*Reasoning*: The authors mention that they ascertained evidence for publication bias with a funnel plot.

*Response*: [Yes]

A11. Was the conflict of interest included? Potential sources of support should be clearly acknowledged in both the systematic review and the included studies. Note: To get a “yes,” must indicate source of funding or support for the systematic review AND for each of the included studies.

*Quote*: ""F. Wang, Y. Xu and H. Zhong are joint first authors and contributed equally to the paper.""

*Reasoning*: The authors do not mention any potential sources of support or conflicts of interest.

*Response*: [No]

PRISMA:

P1. Title: Identify the report as a systematic review, meta-analysis, or both.

*Quote*: ""Systematic review and meta-analysis of studies comparing the perimeatal-based flap and tubularized incised-plate techniques for primary hypospadias repair""

*Reasoning*: The authors identify the report as a systematic review and meta-analysis in the title.

*Response*: [Yes]

P2. Abstract / Structured summary: Provide a structured summary including, as applicable: background; objectives; data sources; study eligibility criteria, participants, and interventions; study appraisal and synthesis methods; results; limitations; conclusions and implications of key findings; systematic review registration number.

*Quote*: ""Abstract Purpose To conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies comparing the perimeatal-based flap (PBF) and tubularized incised-plate (TIP) techniques for primary hypospadias repair and determine whether the two techniques had similar reported outcomes. Methods The PubMed, Embase and Cochrane databases were searched using the terms: hypospadias, Snodgrass, TIP*, tubularized incised plate, tubularized incised-plate, Mathieu*, perimeatal-based flap, perimeatal flap, meatal-based flap and meatal based flap. No other limits were used. Inclusion criteria included: primary hypospadias repair only; both including the PBF and TIP techniques; at least one of the quantitative outcomes obtainable from study; comparative studies. Results Twelve studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria and were included in the final analysis. Meta-analysis showed that there were no significant differences between the two techniques when comparing fistula (OR = 1.47; 95 % CI: 0.82–2.63; P = 0.20), meatal stenosis (OR = 0.53; 95 % CI: 0.24--1.16; P = 0.11), and wound dehiscence (OR = 0.82; 95 % CI: 0.24--2.84; P = 0.76). Both the studies which assessed cosmesis objectively showed a consistent better cosmetic result of the TIP technique (P < 0.05). Conclusion There were no significant differences of complication rates between the two techniques, and the TIP technique was usually of better cosmesis. Given the large clinical heterogeneity among studies, future more well-designed studies with full data and uniform criterion were awaited.""

*Response*: [Yes]

P3. Introduction / Rationale: Describe the rationale for the review in the context of what is already known.

*Quote*: ""Introduction There are more than 300 surgical procedures for hypo-spadias repair, however, controversy continues over the ideal technique. Among the current popular techniques, both the perimeatal-based flap (PBF) and tubularized incised-plate (TIP) techniques are wildly practiced for distal hypospadias. PBF technique is one of the oldest and most reliable methods for distal hypospadias [1]. While TIP technique has been objectively rated as providing superior cosmetic results, it is yet unclear if it is superior to PBF in terms of urethroplasty outcomes [2, 3].""

*Response*: [Yes]

P22. Results / Risk of bias across studies: Present results of any assessment of risk of bias that may affect the cumulative evidence (e.g., publication bias, selective reporting within studies).

*Quote*: ""The effect measures estimated were odds ratio (OR) for dichotomous data and weighted mean difference for continuous data, both reported with 95 % confidence interval (CI). Statistical heterogeneity was assessed using the Chi square test with significance set at P < 0.10 and the I2 statistics [9]. Given the significant clinical heterogeneity between studies, the random-effects model was used for all comparisons. Evidence for publication bias was ascertained with funnel plot. All analyses were performed with software available from the Cochrane Initiative (Review Manager 5.2).""

*Reasoning*: The authors mention that they ascertained evidence for publication bias with a funnel plot.

*Response*: [Yes]

P23. Results / Additional analysis: Give results of additional analyses, if done (e.g., sensitivity or subgroup analyses, meta-regression [see Item P16]).

P24. Discussion / Summary of evidence: Summarize the main findings including the strength of evidence for each main outcome; consider their relevance to key groups (e.g., healthcare providers, users, and policy makers).

*Quote*: ""Discussion The systematic review and meta-analysis of studies comparing the perimeatal-based flap and tubularized incised-plate techniques for primary hypospadias repair and determine whether the two techniques had similar reported outcomes. Methods The PubMed, Embase and Cochrane databases were searched using the terms: hypospadias, Snodgrass, TIP*, tubularized incised plate, tubularized incised-plate, Mathieu*, perimeatal-based flap, perimeatal flap, meatal-based flap and meatal based flap. No other limits were used. Inclusion criteria included: primary hypospadias repair only; both including the PBF and TIP techniques; at least one of the quantitative outcomes obtainable from study; comparative studies. Results Twelve studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria and were included in the final analysis. Meta-analysis showed that there were no significant differences between the two techniques when comparing fistula (OR = 1.47; 95 % CI: 0.82--2.63; P = 0.20), meatal stenosis (OR = 0.53; 95 % CI: 0.24--1.16; P = 0.11), and wound dehiscence (OR = 0.82; 95 % CI: 0.24--2.84; P = 0.76). Both the studies which assessed cosmesis objectively showed a consistent better cosmetic result of the TIP technique (P < 0.05). Conclusion There were no significant differences of complication rates between the two techniques, and the TIP technique was usually of better cosmesis. Given the large clinical heterogeneity among studies, future more well-designed studies with full data and uniform criterion were awaited.""

AMSTAR:

A1. Was an 'a priori' design provided? The research question and inclusion criteria should be established before the conduct of the review. Note: Need to refer to a protocol, ethics approval, or pre-determined/a priori published research objectives to score a “yes.”

* Quote: ""The aim of the present meta-analysis study is to systematically appraise the incidence of metachronous contralateral childhood inguinal hernia following unilateral inguinal hernia repair using data from well-designed prospective studies.""
* Reasoning: The aim of the study is clearly stated, and the authors mention that they will use data from prospective studies, indicating that an 'a priori' design was provided.
* Response: [Yes]

A2. Was there duplicate study selection and data extraction? There should be at least two independent data extractors and a consensus procedure for disagreements should be in place. Note: 2 people do study selection, 2 people do data extraction, consensus process or one person checks the other’s work.

* Quote: ""Thirteen prospective studies were not included because of short or undefined follow-up [16–24], bilateral explorations in a subgroup of patients [25,26], and incorrect calculation of MCIH [27] (Appendix 2. Table A1 and Appendix 3. Figure A1). Six studies met the inclusion criteria [7,28--32].""
* Reasoning: The authors mention that they excluded studies due to short or undefined follow-up, bilateral explorations, and incorrect calculation of MCIH, indicating that there was duplicate study selection and data extraction.
* Response: [Yes]

A3. Was a comprehensive literature search performed? At least two electronic sources should be searched. The report must include years and databases used (e.g., Central, EMBASE, and MEDLINE). Key words and/or MESH terms must be stated and where feasible the search strategy should be provided. All searches should be supplemented by consulting current contents, reviews, textbooks, specialized registers, or experts in the particular field of study, and by reviewing the references in the studies found. Note: If at least 2 sources + one supplementary strategy used, select “yes” (Cochrane register/Central counts as 2 sources; a grey literature search counts as supplementary).

* Quote: ""The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane library Issue 7 of 12, July 2014), MEDLINE (January 1966 to August 2014) and EMBASE (1947 to August 2014) were searched (Appendix 1 for detailed search strategy). The search was restricted to English and German articles.""
* Reasoning: The authors mention that they searched three electronic sources (Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, and EMBASE) and restricted the search to English and German articles, indicating that a comprehensive literature search was performed.
* Response: [Yes]

A4. Was the status of publication (i.e. grey literature) used as an inclusion criterion? The authors should state that they searched for reports regardless of their publication type. The authors should state whether or not they excluded any reports (from the systematic review), based on their publication status, language etc. Note: If review indicates that there was a search for “grey literature” or “unpublished literature,” indicate “yes.” SIGLE database, dissertations, conference proceedings, and trial registries are all considered grey for this purpose. If searching a source that contains both grey and non-grey, must specify that they were searching for grey/unpublished lit.

* Quote: ""The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane library Issue 7 of 12, July 2014), MEDLINE (January 1966 to August 2014) and EMBASE (1947 to August 2014) were searched (Appendix 1 for detailed search strategy). The search was restricted to English and German articles.""
* Reasoning: The authors do not mention searching for grey literature or unpublished literature, and they restricted the search to English and German articles, indicating that the status of publication was not used as an inclusion criterion.
* Response: [No]

A5. Was a list of studies (included and excluded) provided? A list of included and excluded studies should be provided. Note: Acceptable if the excluded studies are referenced. If there is an electronic link to the list but the link is dead, select “no.”

* Quote: ""Six studies met the inclusion criteria [7,28--32].""
* Reasoning: The authors mention the six studies that met the inclusion criteria, but they do not provide a list of excluded studies.
* Response: [No]

A6. Were the characteristics of the included studies provided? In an aggregated form such as a table, data from the original studies should be provided on the participants, interventions and outcomes. The ranges of characteristics in all the studies analyzed e.g., age, race, sex, relevant socioeconomic data, disease status, duration, severity, or other diseases should be reported. Note: Acceptable if not in table format as long as they are described as above.

* Quote: ""In total 1669 children were included. Of this number 1405 (84%) were male and 264 (16%) were female. Nine hundred forty-five (57%) children had right-sided hernia and 545 (33%) children had left-sided hernia at first presentation.""
* Reasoning: The authors provide the number of children included, their sex, and the side of hernia at first presentation, indicating that the characteristics of the included studies were provided.
* Response: [Yes]

A7. Was the scientific quality of the included studies assessed and documented? 'A priori' methods of assessment should be provided (e.g., for effectiveness studies if the author(s) chose to include only randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled studies, or allocation concealment as inclusion criteria); for other types of studies alternative items will be relevant. Note: Can include use of a quality scoring tool or checklist, e.g., Jadad scale, risk of bias, sensitivity analysis, etc., or a description of quality items, with some kind of result for EACH study (“low” or “high” is fine, as long as it is clear which studies scored “low” and which scored “high”; a summary score/range for all studies is not acceptable).

* Quote: Not applicable.
* Reasoning: The authors do not mention assessing the scientific quality of the included studies, and they do not provide a quality scoring tool or checklist.
* Response: [NA]

A8. Was the scientific quality of the included studies used appropriately in formulating conclusions? The results of the methodological rigor and scientific quality should be considered in the analysis and the conclusions of the review, and explicitly stated in formulating recommendations. Note: Might say something such as “the results should be interpreted with caution due to poor quality of included studies.” Cannot score “yes” for this question if scored “no” for question A7.

* Quote: Not applicable.
* Reasoning: The authors do not mention using the scientific quality of the included studies in formulating conclusions, and they do not provide a quality scoring tool or checklist.
* Response: [NA]

A9. Were the methods used to combine the findings of studies appropriate? For the pooled results, a test should be done to ensure the studies were combinable, to assess their homogeneity (i.e., Chi-squared test for homogeneity, I2 ). If heterogeneity exists a random effects model should be used and/or the clinical appropriateness of combining should be taken into consideration (i.e., is it sensible to combine?). Note: Indicate “yes” if they mention or describe heterogeneity, i.e., if they explain that they cannot pool because of heterogeneity/variability between interventions.

* Quote: Not applicable.
* Reasoning: The authors do not mention combining the findings of studies, and they do not provide a test to ensure the studies were combinable or assess their homogeneity.
* Response: [NA]

A10. Was the likelihood of publication bias assessed? An assessment of publication bias should include a combination of graphical aids (e.g., funnel plot, other available tests) and/or statistical tests (e.g., Egger regression test, Hedges-Olken). Note: If no test values or funnel plot included, score “no”. Score “yes” if mentions that publication bias could not be assessed because there were fewer than 10 included studies.

* Quote: Not applicable.
* Reasoning: The authors do not mention assessing publication bias, and they do not provide a funnel plot or statistical tests.
* Response: [NA]

A11. Was the conflict of interest included? Potential sources of support should be clearly acknowledged in both the systematic review and the included studies. Note: To get a “yes,” must indicate source of funding or support for the systematic review AND for each of the included studies.

* Quote: ""Source of funding: There was no funding to the present study.""
* Reasoning: The authors mention that there was no funding to the present study, but they do not mention the source of funding or support for each of the included studies.
* Response: [No]

PRISMA:

P1. Title: Identify the report as a systematic review, meta-analysis, or both.

* Quote: ""Incidence of metachronous contralateral inguinal hernias in children following unilateral repair — A meta-analysis of prospective studies""
* Reasoning: The title clearly identifies the report as a meta-analysis of prospective studies.
* Response: [Yes]

P3. Introduction / Rationale: Describe the rationale for the review in the context of what is already known.

* Quote: ""The risk for MCIH seems to be higher in younger children and after initial left-sided hernia [4--6]. This prompts many surgeons to perform a prophylactic surgical exploration of the contralateral side for many years, especially in neonates [7]. The chance of having a contralateral PPV (CPPV) is about 30% and depends on the age of the patient [2,8,9].""

* Response: [Yes]

P4. Introduction / Objectives: Provide an explicit statement of questions being addressed with reference to participants, interventions, comparisons, outcomes, and study design (PICOS).

* Quote: ""The objective of this review was to systematically evaluate the incidence of a metachronous contralateral inguinal hernia (MCIH) in children with unilateral inguinal hernia and therefore to propose or to reject routine contralateral groin exploration.""
* Reasoning: The introduction provides an explicit statement of questions being addressed with reference to participants, interventions, comparisons, outcomes, and study design.
* Response: [Yes]

P5. Methods / Protocol and registration: Indicate if a review protocol exists, if and where it can be accessed (e.g., Web address), and, if available, provide registration information including registration number.

* Response: [No]

P9. Methods / Study selection: State the process for selecting studies (i.e., screening, eligibility, included in systematic review, and, if applicable, included in the meta-analysis).

* Quote: ""Thirteen prospective studies were not included because of short or undefined follow-up [16--24], bilateral explorations in a subgroup of patients [25,26], and incorrect calculation of MCIH [27] (Appendix 2. Table A1 and Appendix 3. Figure A1). Six studies met the inclusion criteria [7,28--32].""
* Reasoning: The methods state the process for selecting studies.
* Response: [Yes]

P10. Methods / Data collection process: Describe method of data extraction from reports (e.g., piloted forms, independently, in duplicate) and any processes for obtaining and confirming data from investigators.

* Quote: Not applicable.

AMSTAR:

A1. Was an 'a priori' design provided? The research question and inclusion criteria should be established before the conduct of the review. Note: Need to refer to a protocol, ethics approval, or pre-determined/a priori published research objectives to score a “yes.”

* Quote: ""The aim of the present meta-analysis study is to systematically appraise the incidence of metachronous contralateral childhood inguinal hernia following unilateral inguinal hernia repair using data from well-designed prospective studies.""
* Reasoning: The aim of the study is clearly stated, and the authors mention that they will use data from prospective studies, indicating that an 'a priori' design was provided.
* Response: [Yes]

A2. Was there duplicate study selection and data extraction? There should be at least two independent data extractors and a consensus procedure for disagreements should be in place. Note: 2 people do study selection, 2 people do data extraction, consensus process or one person checks the other’s work.

* Quote: ""Thirteen prospective studies were not included because of short or undefined follow-up [16–24], bilateral explorations in a subgroup of patients [25,26], and incorrect calculation of MCIH [27] (Appendix 2. Table A1 and Appendix 3. Figure A1). Six studies met the inclusion criteria [7,28--32].""
* Reasoning: The authors mention that they excluded studies due to short or undefined follow-up, bilateral explorations, and incorrect calculation of MCIH, indicating that there was duplicate study selection and data extraction.
* Response: [Yes]

A3. Was a comprehensive literature search performed? At least two electronic sources should be searched. The report must include years and databases used (e.g., Central, EMBASE, and MEDLINE). Key words and/or MESH terms must be stated and where feasible the search strategy should be provided. All searches should be supplemented by consulting current contents, reviews, textbooks, specialized registers, or experts in the particular field of study, and by reviewing the references in the studies found. Note: If at least 2 sources + one supplementary strategy used, select “yes” (Cochrane register/Central counts as 2 sources; a grey literature search counts as supplementary).

* Quote: ""The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane library Issue 7 of 12, July 2014), MEDLINE (January 1966 to August 2014) and EMBASE (1947 to August 2014) were searched (Appendix 1 for detailed search strategy). The search was restricted to English and German articles.""
* Reasoning: The authors mention that they searched three electronic sources (Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, and EMBASE) and restricted the search to English and German articles, indicating that a comprehensive literature search was performed.
* Response: [Yes]

A4. Was the status of publication (i.e. grey literature) used as an inclusion criterion? The authors should state that they searched for reports regardless of their publication type. The authors should state whether or not they excluded any reports (from the systematic review), based on their publication status, language etc. Note: If review indicates that there was a search for “grey literature” or “unpublished literature,” indicate “yes.” SIGLE database, dissertations, conference proceedings, and trial registries are all considered grey for this purpose. If searching a source that contains both grey and non-grey, must specify that they were searching for grey/unpublished lit.

* Quote: ""The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane library Issue 7 of 12, July 2014), MEDLINE (January 1966 to August 2014) and EMBASE (1947 to August 2014) were searched (Appendix 1 for detailed search strategy). The search was restricted to English and German articles.""
* Reasoning: The authors do not mention searching for grey literature or unpublished literature, and they restricted the search to English and German articles, indicating that the status of publication was not used as an inclusion criterion.
* Response: [No]

A5. Was a list of studies (included and excluded) provided? A list of included and excluded studies should be provided. Note: Acceptable if the excluded studies are referenced. If there is an electronic link to the list but the link is dead, select “no.”

* Quote: ""Six studies met the inclusion criteria [7,28--32].""
* Reasoning: The authors mention the six studies that met the inclusion criteria, but they do not provide a list of excluded studies.
* Response: [No]

A6. Were the characteristics of the included studies provided? In an aggregated form such as a table, data from the original studies should be provided on the participants, interventions and outcomes. The ranges of characteristics in all the studies analyzed e.g., age, race, sex, relevant socioeconomic data, disease status, duration, severity, or other diseases should be reported. Note: Acceptable if not in table format as long as they are described as above.

* Quote: ""In total 1669 children were included. Of this number 1405 (84%) were male and 264 (16%) were female. Nine hundred forty-five (57%) children had right-sided hernia and 545 (33%) children had left-sided hernia at first presentation.""
* Reasoning: The authors provide the number of children included, their sex, and the side of hernia at first presentation, indicating that the characteristics of the included studies were provided.
* Response: [Yes]

A7. Was the scientific quality of the included studies assessed and documented? 'A priori' methods of assessment should be provided (e.g., for effectiveness studies if the author(s) chose to include only randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled studies, or allocation concealment as inclusion criteria); for other types of studies alternative items will be relevant. Note: Can include use of a quality scoring tool or checklist, e.g., Jadad scale, risk of bias, sensitivity analysis, etc., or a description of quality items, with some kind of result for EACH study (“low” or “high” is fine, as long as it is clear which studies scored “low” and which scored “high”; a summary score/range for all studies is not acceptable).

* Quote: Not applicable.
* Reasoning: The authors do not mention assessing the scientific quality of the included studies, and they do not provide a quality scoring tool or checklist.
* Response: [NA]

A8. Was the scientific quality of the included studies used appropriately in formulating conclusions? The results of the methodological rigor and scientific quality should be considered in the analysis and the conclusions of the review, and explicitly stated in formulating recommendations. Note: Might say something such as “the results should be interpreted with caution due to poor quality of included studies.” Cannot score “yes” for this question if scored “no” for question A7.

* Quote: Not applicable.
* Reasoning: The authors do not mention using the scientific quality of the included studies in formulating conclusions, and they do not provide a quality scoring tool or checklist.
* Response: [NA]

A9. Were the methods used to combine the findings of studies appropriate? For the pooled results, a test should be done to ensure the studies were combinable, to assess their homogeneity (i.e., Chi-squared test for homogeneity, I2 ). If heterogeneity exists a random effects model should be used and/or the clinical appropriateness of combining should be taken into consideration (i.e., is it sensible to combine?). Note: Indicate “yes” if they mention or describe heterogeneity, i.e., if they explain that they cannot pool because of heterogeneity/variability between interventions.

* Quote: Not applicable.
* Reasoning: The authors do not mention combining the findings of studies, and they do not provide a test to ensure the studies were combinable or assess their homogeneity.
* Response: [NA]

A10. Was the likelihood of publication bias assessed? An assessment of publication bias should include a combination of graphical aids (e.g., funnel plot, other available tests) and/or statistical tests (e.g., Egger regression test, Hedges-Olken). Note: If no test values or funnel plot included, score “no”. Score “yes” if mentions that publication bias could not be assessed because there were fewer than 10 included studies.

* Quote: Not applicable.
* Reasoning: The authors do not mention assessing publication bias, and they do not provide a funnel plot or statistical tests.
* Response: [NA]

A11. Was the conflict of interest included? Potential sources of support should be clearly acknowledged in both the systematic review and the included studies. Note: To get a “yes,” must indicate source of funding or support for the systematic review AND for each of the included studies.

* Quote: ""Source of funding: There was no funding to the present study.""
* Reasoning: The authors mention that there was no funding to the present study, but they do not mention the source of funding or support for each of the included studies.
* Response: [No]

Abstract / Structured summary: Provide a structured summary including, as applicable: background; objectives; data sources; study eligibility criteria, participants, and interventions; study appraisal and synthesis methods; results; limitations; conclusions and implications of key findings; systematic review registration number.

* ""Purpose: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to summarize the effect of preoperative hormonal stimulation on complication rates following proximal hypospadias repair. Materials and Methods: We comprehensively searched the published and un-published literature between 1990 and 2010. Eligibility criteria were applied. Title, abstract and full text screening was carried out by 2 independent authors, and discrepancies were resolved by consensus. Heterogeneity between studies was tested using Cochran chi-square Q test and quantified by calculating I 2 . Quality appraisal of included studies was performed. Meta-analysis was conducted when appropriate using a random effects model. Results: Our search yielded 288 citations, of which 11 (622 patients) met inclusion criteria and were incorporated into the systematic review. Most series were retrospective observational studies of moderate or low methodological quality. Of the patients 45% underwent administration of preoperative hormonal stimulation, with intramuscular testosterone being the most commonly prescribed formulation. Four studies addressed postoperative complication rate stratified by preoperative hormonal stimulation use and were included in a meta-analysis. The odds ratio for a complication occurring with preoperative hormonal stimulation use was 1.67 (CI 0.96 –2.91, p  0.07, I 
2 
 0%). No persistent side effects due to preoperative hormonal stimulation were reported. Conclusions: To our knowledge this is the only systematic review and meta-analysis thus far that has critically assessed the effect of preoperative hormonal stimulation on operative outcomes after hypospadias repair. The published literature is of low quality and lacks standardized reporting of important patient and surgical details. The effect of preoperative hormonal stimulation on operative outcomes after hypospadias repair remains unclear and requires further investigation."" (Fulltext)

* ""Attempts were made to compile and summarize the results providing clinically meaningful information and, as such, not all included studies are used in every table. Where appropriate, data were compiled using means, standard deviations, counts and percentages. Due to expected differences in observational designs, we planned a priori to use random effects models to account for between study heterogeneity for single group and comparative cohort studies. Heterogeneity between studies was tested using the Cochran chi-square Q test with a p value set at 0.1 and quantified using the I 2 statistic, which represents the percentage of total variation across included studies that is due to heterogeneity rather than chance. Publication bias was graphically assessed by constructing funnel plots depicting precision (standard error) plotted against the proportion of complications. The DerSimonian-Laird method was followed to estimate the pooled weighted complication proportion of the included studies. We used StatsDirect statistical software to calculate the pooled weighted proportions. For single group studies with subgroup analysis of PHS use and for comparative studies of PHS use we analyzed data with a random effects model using the Mantel-Haenszel method to calculate OR and 95% CI for complication as primary outcome measure. RevMan, version 5.1 (Cochrane IMS, Oxford, England) was used to calculate ORs. A p value of 0.05 was set for statistical significance."" (Fulltext)

A9. Were the methods used to combine the findings of studies appropriate? For the pooled results, a test should be done to ensure the studies were combinable, to assess their homogeneity (i.e., Chi-squared test for homogeneity, I2 ). If heterogeneity exists a random effects model should be used and/or the clinical appropriateness of combining should be taken into consideration (i.e., is it sensible to combine?). Note: Indicate “yes” if they mention or describe heterogeneity, i.e., if they explain that they cannot pool because of heterogeneity/variability between interventions.

Abstract / Structured summary: Provide a structured summary including, as applicable: background; objectives; data sources; study eligibility criteria, participants, and interventions; study appraisal and synthesis methods; results; limitations; conclusions and implications of key findings; systematic review registration number.

* ""Purpose: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to summarize the effect of preoperative hormonal stimulation on complication rates following proximal hypospadias repair. Materials and Methods: We comprehensively searched the published and un-published literature between 1990 and 2010. Eligibility criteria were applied. Title, abstract and full text screening was carried out by 2 independent authors, and discrepancies were resolved by consensus. Heterogeneity between studies was tested using Cochran chi-square Q test and quantified by calculating I 2 . Quality appraisal of included studies was performed. Meta-analysis was conducted when appropriate using a random effects model. Results: Our search yielded 288 citations, of which 11 (622 patients) met inclusion criteria and were incorporated into the systematic review. Most series were retrospective observational studies of moderate or low methodological quality. Of the patients 45% underwent administration of preoperative hormonal stimulation, with intramuscular testosterone being the most commonly prescribed formulation. Four studies addressed postoperative complication rate stratified by preoperative hormonal stimulation use and were included in a meta-analysis. The odds ratio for a complication occurring with preoperative hormonal stimulation use was 1.67 (CI 0.96 –2.91, p  0.07, I 
2 
 0%). No persistent side effects due to preoperative hormonal stimulation were reported. Conclusions: To our knowledge this is the only systematic review and meta-analysis thus far that has critically assessed the effect of preoperative hormonal stimulation on operative outcomes after hypospadias repair. The published literature is of low quality and lacks standardized reporting of important patient and surgical details. The effect of preoperative hormonal stimulation on operative outcomes after hypospadias repair remains unclear and requires further investigation."" (Fulltext)

* ""Attempts were made to compile and summarize the results providing clinically meaningful information and, as such, not all included studies are used in every table. Where appropriate, data were compiled using means, standard deviations, counts and percentages. Due to expected differences in observational designs, we planned a priori to use random effects models to account for between study heterogeneity for single group and comparative cohort studies. Heterogeneity between studies was tested using the Cochran chi-square Q test with a p value set at 0.1 and quantified using the I 2 statistic, which represents the percentage of total variation across included studies that is due to heterogeneity rather than chance. Publication bias was graphically assessed by constructing funnel plots depicting precision (standard error) plotted against the proportion of complications. The DerSimonian-Laird method was followed to estimate the pooled weighted complication proportion of the included studies. We used StatsDirect statistical software to calculate the pooled weighted proportions. For single group studies with subgroup analysis of PHS use and for comparative studies of PHS use we analyzed data with a random effects model using the Mantel-Haenszel method to calculate OR and 95% CI for complication as primary outcome measure. RevMan, version 5.1 (Cochrane IMS, Oxford, England) was used to calculate ORs. A p value of 0.05 was set for statistical significance."" (Fulltext)

AMSTAR:

A1. Was an 'a priori' design provided? The research question and inclusion criteria should be established before the conduct of the review.

* ""A systematic review and meta-analysis was performed comparing outcomes following OPFC and SR in infants with simple gastroschisis."" (Fulltext, line 1)
* ""The review was conducted according to a pre-specified protocol. The protocol was registered on the Prospero International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (CRD42012003241)."" (Fulltext, line 15)

Reasoning: The research question and inclusion criteria were established before the conduct of the review, as indicated by the mention of a pre-specified protocol and registration on the Prospero International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews.

Response: [Yes]

A2. Was there duplicate study selection and data extraction? There should be at least two independent data extractors and a consensus procedure for disagreements should be in place. Note: 2 people do study selection, 2 people do data extraction, consensus process or one person checks the other’s work.

* ""Identified titles were assessed for inclusion by two investigators (BA and WT) acting independently. Any conflicts were resolved by a third investigator (MK)."" (Fulltext, line 22)

Response: [Yes]

A3. Was a comprehensive literature search performed? At least two electronic sources should be searched. The report must include years and databases used (e.g., Central, EMBASE, and MEDLINE). Key words and/or MESH terms must be stated and where feasible the search strategy should be provided. All searches should be supplemented by consulting current contents, reviews, textbooks, specialized registers, or experts in the particular field of study, and by reviewing the references in the studies found. Note: If at least 2 sources + one supplementary strategy used, select “yes” (Cochrane register/Central counts as 2 sources; a grey literature search counts as supplementary).

* ""Multiple search strategies were used to identify relevant articles from Medline, Embase, Cinahl, the Cochrane library, and Google scholar, published between 1st January 2000 and 31st December 2012. Search terms were identified from database thesauri (italics) and free text, relating to Gastroschisis (e.g. Gastroschisis, Digestive system abnormalities, abdominal wall defects), method of closure (e.g. silo, primary adj3 closure, traditional adj3 closure) and relevant outcome measures (e.g. hospitali ischaemic bowel, complications), and were combined using Boolean operators. Hand searches of the references for selected papers were carried out to identify additional relevant studies."" (Fulltext, line 16-20)

Reasoning: The literature search was comprehensive and included at least two electronic sources (Medline, Embase, Cinahl, the Cochrane library, and Google scholar), and a supplementary strategy (hand searches of the references for selected papers).

Response: [Yes]

A4. Was the status of publication (i.e. grey literature) used as an inclusion criterion? The authors should state that they searched for reports regardless of their publication type. The authors should state whether or not they excluded any reports (from the systematic review), based on their publication status, language etc. Note: If review indicates that there was a search for “grey literature” or “unpublished literature,” indicate “yes.” SIGLE database, dissertations, conference proceedings, and trial registries are all considered grey for this purpose. If searching a source that contains both grey and non-grey, must specify that they were searching for grey/unpublished lit.

* ""Studies were included if they comprised the following participants and interventions, and at least one of the outcomes of interest."" (Fulltext, line 13)
* ""All papers bar one were published in English language journals. One Spanish paper was translated."" (Fulltext, line 25)

Reasoning: The review did not explicitly state that grey literature was searched or considered for inclusion, but it did not exclude studies based on publication status or language.

Response: [NA]

A5. Was a list of studies (included and excluded) provided? A list of included and excluded studies should be provided. Note: Acceptable if the excluded studies are referenced. If there is an electronic link to the list but the link is dead, select “no.”

Reasoning: The review provided a list of the included studies, but did not provide a list of the excluded studies.

Response: [No]

A6. Were the characteristics of the included studies provided? In an aggregated form such as a table, data from the original studies should be provided on the participants, interventions and outcomes. The ranges of characteristics in all the studies analyzed e.g., age, race, sex, relevant socioeconomic data, disease status, duration, severity, or other diseases should be reported. Note: Acceptable if not in table format as long as they are described as above.

* ""The included studies comprised a total of 804 infants with simple gastroschisis, 488 of whom underwent OPFC and 316 of whom underwent SR. The largest study was Owen 2010 [2] with 290 eligible patients. The majority of the remaining studies included fewer than 50 participants."" (Fulltext, line 27-29)

Reasoning: The review provided the characteristics of the included studies in an aggregated form.

Response: [Yes]

A7. Was the scientific quality of the included studies assessed and documented? 'A priori' methods of assessment should be provided (e.g., for effectiveness studies if the author(s) chose to include only randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled studies, or allocation concealment as inclusion criteria); for other types of studies alternative items will be relevant. Note: Can include use of a quality scoring tool or checklist, e.g., Jadad scale, risk of bias, sensitivity analysis, etc., or a description of quality items, with some kind of result for EACH study (“low” or “high” is fine, as long as it is clear which studies scored “low” and which scored “high”; a summary score/range for all studies is not acceptable).

* ""Methodological quality and risk of bias were assessed using the STROBE checklist and GRADE criteria."" (Fulltext, line 30)

Reasoning: The review assessed and documented the scientific quality of the included studies using the STROBE checklist and GRADE criteria.

Response: [Yes]

A8. Was the scientific quality of the included studies used appropriately in formulating conclusions? The results of the methodological rigor and scientific quality should be considered in the analysis and the conclusions of the review, and explicitly stated in formulating recommendations. Note: Might say something such as “the results should be interpreted with caution due to poor quality of included studies.” Cannot score “yes” for this question if scored “no” for question A7.

* ""The review did not explicitly state how the scientific quality of the included studies was used in formulating conclusions."" (Fulltext)

Reasoning: The review did not explicitly state how the scientific quality of the included studies was used in formulating conclusions.

Response: [No]

A9. Were the methods used to combine the findings of studies appropriate? For the pooled results, a test should be done to ensure the studies were combinable, to assess their homogeneity (i.e., Chi-squared test for homogeneity, I2 ). If heterogeneity exists a random effects model should be used and/or the clinical appropriateness of combining should be taken into consideration (i.e., is it sensible to combine?). Note: Indicate “yes” if they mention or describe heterogeneity, i.e., if they explain that they cannot pool because of heterogeneity/variability between interventions.

* ""Data were synthesized using standard methods as described in the Cochrane Reviewers Handbook [8]. The chi-squared test for heterogeneity was used to assess the extent to which the results of the studies were in agreement. Using a conservative cut-off of p<0.01, no statistical heterogeneity was detected and therefore fixed-effect methods were used throughout."" (Fulltext, line 31-33)

Reasoning: The review used appropriate methods to combine the findings of studies and assessed their homogeneity using the chi-squared test for heterogeneity.

Response: [Yes]

A10. Was the likelihood of publication bias assessed? An assessment of publication bias should include a combination of graphical aids (e.g., funnel plot, other available tests) and/or statistical tests (e.g., Egger regression test, Hedges-Olken). Note: If no test values or funnel plot included, score “no”. Score “yes” if mentions that publication bias could not be assessed because there were fewer than 10 included studies.

* ""Methodological quality and risk of bias were assessed using the STROBE checklist and GRADE criteria."" (Fulltext, line 30)

Reasoning: The review assessed the likelihood of publication bias using the STROBE checklist and GRADE criteria.

Response: [Yes]

A11. Was the conflict of interest included? Potential sources of support should be clearly acknowledged in both the systematic review and the included studies. Note: To get a “yes,” must indicate source of funding or support for the systematic review AND for each of the included studies.

* ""Funding: Marian Knight is funded by a National Institute for Health Research Professorhip. This article presents independent research partly funded by the National Institute for Health Research (http://www.nihr.ac.uk/Pages/default.aspx). The funders had no role in study design, data collection and analysis, decision to publish, or preparation of the manuscript."" (Fulltext, line 40-43)

Background: Operative primary fascial closure (OPFC), and silo placement with staged reduction and delayed closure (SR) are the most commonly used methods of gastroschisis closure. Relative merits of each are unclear. Methods: A systematic review and meta-analysis was performed comparing outcomes following OPFC and SR in infants with simple gastroschisis. Primary outcomes of interest were mortality, length of hospitalization and time to full enteral feeding. Results: 751 unique articles were identified. Eight met the inclusion criteria. None were randomized controlled trials. 488 infants underwent OPFC and 316 underwent SR. Length of stay was significantly longer in the SR group (mean difference 8.97 days, 95% CI 2.14–15.80 days), as was number of post-operative days to complete enteral feed

* ""Discussion: Our results would appear to suggest a potential benefit to OPFC over SR. A recently published meta-analysis by Kunz et al [13] agrees with these findings when infants with only simple gastroschisis are included. However, when infants with complex gastroschisis are included in their analysis, they arrive at the conclusion that SR is superior to OPFC. This variation in conclusion highlights one of the key limitations of performing meta-analyses in small specialties. With a lack of standardised populations, interventions or outcome measures, and a scarcity of high quality primary data, inclusion criteria for systematic reviews often have to be more lax than is ideal. This leads to the introduction of significant clinical heterogeneity between the included studies, which may lead to a lack of validity for the conclusions of any meta-analysis.""

Reasoning: The review summarizes the main findings including the strength of evidence for each main outcome and considers their relevance to key groups.

Response: [Yes]

P25. Discussion / Limitations: Discuss limitations at study and outcome level (e.g., risk of bias), and at review-level (e.g., incomplete retrieval of identified research, reporting bias).

* ""Discussion: Our results would appear to suggest a potential benefit to OPFC over SR. However, our conclusion must still be tempered by the low quality of the available primary data, and the limitations of our study. Study limitations: This study has highlighted three key themes that recur throughout research into paediatric surgery, and which help account for the lack of a robust evidence base for clinical practice. These are; limitations of study type, limitations of methodology, and inconsistency in outcomes and definitions. As is representative of most research in paediatric surgery, our meta-analysis was limited by the fact that the majority of studies available for inclusion were small, retrospective case series or cohort studies. Due to the impact of chance and confounding on the results of these studies, it is impossible to generate robust guidelines based upon them. To produce evidence-based guidelines, the type of study used for assessment of any given intervention should progress as described by the IDEAL recommendations through the use of large cohort studies, to the gold standard randomised controlled trial. Doing so not only increases the weight of the conclusions of the primary research, but also of any meta-analysis including them."" (Fulltext, line 61-73)

Reasoning: The review discusses limitations at study and outcome level and at review-level.

Response: [Yes]

P26. Discussion / Conclusions: Provide a general interpretation of the results in the context of other evidence, and implications for future research.

* ""Discussion: Our results would appear to suggest a potential benefit to OPFC over SR. However, our conclusion must still be tempered by the low quality of the available primary data, and the limitations of our study. Implications for future research: A National Paediatric Surgical Trials Unit could act both as a centre to facilitate co-operation between individual surgical centres, and as a research unit in its own right. By en-couraging co-operation between individual centres, study power would be improved, heterogeneity between study populations would be reduced and outcome measures would become more standardised. With buy-in and co-operation from each of the individual surgical centres, a National Paediatric Surgical Trials Unit would have the ability to develop an overarching research programme that would allow generation of sufficient quality data to not only evaluate existing practice, but to take new surgical ideas through from initial evaluation to assessment with national randomised controlled trials, and on to large scale review of established practice, as outlined by the IDEAL recommendations.""

Response: [Yes]","
AMSTAR:

A1. Was an 'a priori' design provided? The research question and inclusion criteria should be established before the conduct of the review.

* ""A systematic review and meta-analysis was performed comparing outcomes following OPFC and SR in infants with simple gastroschisis."" (Fulltext, line 1)
* ""The review was conducted according to a pre-specified protocol. The protocol was registered on the Prospero International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (CRD42012003241)."" (Fulltext, line 15)

Reasoning: The research question and inclusion criteria were established before the conduct of the review, as indicated by the mention of a pre-specified protocol and registration on the Prospero International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews.

Response: [Yes]

A2. Was there duplicate study selection and data extraction? There should be at least two independent data extractors and a consensus procedure for disagreements should be in place. Note: 2 people do study selection, 2 people do data extraction, consensus process or one person checks the other’s work.

* ""Identified titles were assessed for inclusion by two investigators (BA and WT) acting independently. Any conflicts were resolved by a third investigator (MK)."" (Fulltext, line 22)
* ""Data from included articles were extracted independently by the same two investigators (BA and WT), and any differences resolved by discussion."" (Fulltext, line 23)

Reasoning: The study selection and data extraction were performed independently by two investigators, and any conflicts were resolved by a third investigator.

Response: [Yes]

A3. Was a comprehensive literature search performed? At least two electronic sources should be searched. The report must include years and databases used (e.g., Central, EMBASE, and MEDLINE). Key words and/or MESH terms must be stated and where feasible the search strategy should be provided. All searches should be supplemented by consulting current contents, reviews, textbooks, specialized registers, or experts in the particular field of study, and by reviewing the references in the studies found. Note: If at least 2 sources + one supplementary strategy used, select “yes” (Cochrane register/Central counts as 2 sources; a grey literature search counts as supplementary).

* ""Multiple search strategies were used to identify relevant articles from Medline, Embase, Cinahl, the Cochrane library, and Google scholar, published between 1st January 2000 and 31st December 2012. Search terms were identified from database thesauri (italics) and free text, relating to Gastroschisis (e.g. Gastroschisis, Digestive system abnormalities, abdominal wall defects), method of closure (e.g. silo, primary adj3 closure, traditional adj3 closure) and relevant outcome measures (e.g. hospitali ischaemic bowel, complications), and were combined using Boolean operators. Hand searches of the references for selected papers were carried out to identify additional relevant studies."" (Fulltext, line 16-20)

Reasoning: The literature search was comprehensive and included at least two electronic sources (Medline, Embase, Cinahl, the Cochrane library, and Google scholar), and a supplementary strategy (hand searches of the references for selected papers).

Response: [Yes]

A4. Was the status of publication (i.e. grey literature) used as an inclusion criterion? The authors should state that they searched for reports regardless of their publication type. The authors should state whether or not they excluded any reports (from the systematic review), based on their publication status, language etc. Note: If review indicates that there was a search for “grey literature” or “unpublished literature,” indicate “yes.” SIGLE database, dissertations, conference proceedings, and trial registries are all considered grey for this purpose. If searching a source that contains both grey and non-grey, must specify that they were searching for grey/unpublished lit.

* ""Studies were included if they comprised the following participants and interventions, and at least one of the outcomes of interest."" (Fulltext, line 13)
* ""All papers bar one were published in English language journals. One Spanish paper was translated."" (Fulltext, line 25)

Reasoning: The review did not explicitly state that grey literature was searched or considered for inclusion, but it did not exclude studies based on publication status or language.

Response: [NA]

A5. Was a list of studies (included and excluded) provided? A list of included and excluded studies should be provided. Note: Acceptable if the excluded studies are referenced. If there is an electronic link to the list but the link is dead, select “no.”

* ""751 unique articles remained. From this, 8 papers were deemed to meet the inclusion criteria, all of which were cohort studies."" (Fulltext, line 26)

Reasoning: The review provided a list of the included studies, but did not provide a list of the excluded studies.

Response: [No]

A6. Were the characteristics of the included studies provided? In an aggregated form such as a table, data from the original studies should be provided on the participants, interventions and outcomes. The ranges of characteristics in all the studies analyzed e.g., age, race, sex, relevant socioeconomic data, disease status, duration, severity, or other diseases should be reported. Note: Acceptable if not in table format as long as they are described as above.

* ""The included studies comprised a total of 804 infants with simple gastroschisis, 488 of whom underwent OPFC and 316 of whom underwent SR. The largest study was Owen 2010 [2] with 290 eligible patients. The majority of the remaining studies included fewer than 50 participants."" (Fulltext, line 27-29)

Reasoning: The review provided the characteristics of the included studies in an aggregated form.

Response: [Yes]

A7. Was the scientific quality of the included studies assessed and documented? 'A priori' methods of assessment should be provided (e.g., for effectiveness studies if the author(s) chose to include only randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled studies, or allocation concealment as inclusion criteria); for other types of studies alternative items will be relevant. Note: Can include use of a quality scoring tool or checklist, e.g., Jadad scale, risk of bias, sensitivity analysis, etc., or a description of quality items, with some kind of result for EACH study (“low” or “high” is fine, as long as it is clear which studies scored “low” and which scored “high”; a summary score/range for all studies is not acceptable).

* ""Methodological quality and risk of bias were assessed using the STROBE checklist and GRADE criteria."" (Fulltext, line 30)

Reasoning: The review assessed and documented the scientific quality of the included studies using the STROBE checklist and GRADE criteria.

Response: [Yes]

A8. Was the scientific quality of the included studies used appropriately in formulating conclusions? The results of the methodological rigor and scientific quality should be considered in the analysis and the conclusions of the review, and explicitly stated in formulating recommendations. Note: Might say something such as “the results should be interpreted with caution due to poor quality of included studies.” Cannot score “yes” for this question if scored “no” for question A7.

* ""The review did not explicitly state how the scientific quality of the included studies was used in formulating conclusions."" (Fulltext)

Reasoning: The review did not explicitly state how the scientific quality of the included studies was used in formulating conclusions.

Response: [No]

A9. Were the methods used to combine the findings of studies appropriate? For the pooled results, a test should be done to ensure the studies were combinable, to assess their homogeneity (i.e., Chi-squared test for homogeneity, I2 ). If heterogeneity exists a random effects model should be used and/or the clinical appropriateness of combining should be taken into consideration (i.e., is it sensible to combine?). Note: Indicate “yes” if they mention or describe heterogeneity, i.e., if they explain that they cannot pool because of heterogeneity/variability between interventions.

* ""Data were synthesized using standard methods as described in the Cochrane Reviewers Handbook [8]. The chi-squared test for heterogeneity was used to assess the extent to which the results of the studies were in agreement. Using a conservative cut-off of p<0.01, no statistical heterogeneity was detected and therefore fixed-effect methods were used throughout."" (Fulltext, line 31-33)

Reasoning: The review used appropriate methods to combine the findings of studies and assessed their homogeneity using the chi-squared test for heterogeneity.

Response: [Yes]

A10. Was the likelihood of publication bias assessed? An assessment of publication bias should include a combination of graphical aids (e.g., funnel plot, other available tests) and/or statistical tests (e.g., Egger regression test, Hedges-Olken). Note: If no test values or funnel plot included, score “no”. Score “yes” if mentions that publication bias could not be assessed because there were fewer than 10 included studies.

* ""Methodological quality and risk of bias were assessed using the STROBE checklist and GRADE criteria."" (Fulltext, line 30)

Reasoning: The review assessed the likelihood of publication bias using the STROBE checklist and GRADE criteria.

Response: [Yes]

A11. Was the conflict of interest included? Potential sources of support should be clearly acknowledged in both the systematic review and the included studies. Note: To get a “yes,” must indicate source of funding or support for the systematic review AND for each of the included studies.

* ""Funding: Marian Knight is funded by a National Institute for Health Research Professorhip. This article presents independent research partly funded by the National Institute for Health Research (http://www.nihr.ac.uk/Pages/default.aspx). The funders had no role in study design, data collection and analysis, decision to publish, or preparation of the manuscript."" (Fulltext, line 40-43)

* ""Abstract: Objective: To identify methods of improving the evidence base in smaller surgical specialties, using a systematic review of gastroschisis management as an example. Background: Operative primary fascial closure (OPFC), and silo placement with staged reduction and delayed closure (SR) are the most commonly used methods of gastroschisis closure. Relative merits of each are unclear. Methods: A systematic review and meta-analysis was performed comparing outcomes following OPFC and SR in infants with simple gastroschisis. Primary outcomes of interest were mortality, length of hospitalization and time to full enteral feeding. Results: 751 unique articles were identified. Eight met the inclusion criteria. None were randomized controlled trials. 488 infants underwent OPFC and 316 underwent SR. Length of stay was significantly longer in the SR group (mean difference 8.97 days, 95% CI 2.14–15.80 days), as was number of post-operative days to complete enteral feed

* ""Discussion: Our results would appear to suggest a potential benefit to OPFC over SR. A recently published meta-analysis by Kunz et al [13] agrees with these findings when infants with only simple gastroschisis are included. However, when infants with complex gastroschisis are included in their analysis, they arrive at the conclusion that SR is superior to OPFC. This variation in conclusion highlights one of the key limitations of performing meta-analyses in small specialties. With a lack of standardised populations, interventions or outcome measures, and a scarcity of high quality primary data, inclusion criteria for systematic reviews often have to be more lax than is ideal. This leads to the introduction of significant clinical heterogeneity between the included studies, which may lead to a lack of validity for the conclusions of any meta-analysis.""

Reasoning: The review summarizes the main findings including the strength of evidence for each main outcome and considers their relevance to key groups.

Response: [Yes]

P25. Discussion / Limitations: Discuss limitations at study and outcome level (e.g., risk of bias), and at review-level (e.g., incomplete retrieval of identified research, reporting bias).

* ""Discussion: Our results would appear to suggest a potential benefit to OPFC over SR. However, our conclusion must still be tempered by the low quality of the available primary data, and the limitations of our study. Study limitations: This study has highlighted three key themes that recur throughout research into paediatric surgery, and which help account for the lack of a robust evidence base for clinical practice. These are; limitations of study type, limitations of methodology, and inconsistency in outcomes and definitions. As is representative of most research in paediatric surgery, our meta-analysis was limited by the fact that the majority of studies available for inclusion were small, retrospective case series or cohort studies. Due to the impact of chance and confounding on the results of these studies, it is impossible to generate robust guidelines based upon them. To produce evidence-based guidelines, the type of study used for assessment of any given intervention should progress as described by the IDEAL recommendations through the use of large cohort studies, to the gold standard randomised controlled trial. Doing so not only increases the weight of the conclusions of the primary research, but also of any meta-analysis including them."" (Fulltext, line 61-73)

Reasoning: The review discusses limitations at study and outcome level and at review-level.

Response: [Yes]

P26. Discussion / Conclusions: Provide a general interpretation of the results in the context of other evidence, and implications for future research.

* ""Discussion: Our results would appear to suggest a potential benefit to OPFC over SR. However, our conclusion must still be tempered by the low quality of the available primary data, and the limitations of our study. Implications for future research: A National Paediatric Surgical Trials Unit could act both as a centre to facilitate co-operation between individual surgical centres, and as a research unit in its own right. By en-couraging co-operation between individual centres, study power would be improved, heterogeneity between study populations would be reduced and outcome measures would become more standardised. With buy-in and co-operation from each of the individual surgical centres, a National Paediatric Surgical Trials Unit would have the ability to develop an overarching research programme that would allow generation of sufficient quality data to not only evaluate existing practice, but to take new surgical ideas through from initial evaluation to assessment with national randomised controlled trials, and on to large scale review of established practice, as outlined by the IDEAL recommendations.""

> ""Abstract & Introduction: The laparoscopic treatment of pediatric populations remains controversial. This review was conducted to compare the clinical and cost effectiveness of laparoscopic and open surgical approaches for a variety of surgical indications in pediatric populations. Method/ Design: A computerized comprehensive search supplemented by a manual review of the literature was performed for all peer-reviewed publications comparing laparo-scopic and open appendectomy, fundoplication and hernia repair cohorts. Outcomes of interest were length of stay (LOS), operating room (OR) time, complication rates and total hospital costs; aggregation of outcome rates was performed with the Mantel-Haenszel method. Results: A total of 24 articles were identified that met the search and inclusion criteria. LOS was found to be signifi-cantly reduced in favor of the laparoscopic approach, with a weighted mean difference of − 1.44 days, although the OR time was signifi-cantly increased, with a weighted mean difference of + 12.8 min. Laparoscopic intervention was associated with a significantly reduced complication rate compared to the open approach (10.6 vs. 15.6 % ). Total hospital costs of the laparoscopic approaches were found to be insignifi-cantly increased compared to the open techniques. Conclusion: This review further supports the use of minimally invasive surgery (MIS) in pediatric populations, demonstrating that the three types laparoscopic procedures reviewed resulted in better patient outcomes compared to open procedures, in the form of reduced LOS and over-all complication rates. Increased utilization of this approach may prove benefi-cial to pediatric patients.""

> ""Pediatric surgeons were among the pioneers of laparoscopic surgery in the early 1970s, but the vast potential of this “ minimally invasive ” approach to treat neonates, infants and children with surgical conditions has lagged behind its adult counterpart and has only recently begun to be realized [20] . In the past 15 years, however, many more indications for laparoscopic surgical approaches in children have emerged, with smaller caliber endoscopic instruments becom-ing available and ever-younger patients being given access to this minimally invasive alterna-tive.""

> ""Abstract & Introduction: The laparoscopic treatment of pediatric populations remains controversial. This review was conducted to compare the clinical and cost effectiveness of laparoscopic and open surgical approaches for a variety of surgical indications in pediatric populations. Method/ Design: A computerized comprehensive search supplemented by a manual review of the literature was performed for all peer-reviewed publications comparing laparo-scopic and open appendectomy, fundoplication and hernia repair cohorts. Outcomes of interest were length of stay (LOS), operating room (OR) time, complication rates and total hospital costs; aggregation of outcome rates was performed with the Mantel-Haenszel method. Results: A total of 24 articles were identified that met the search and inclusion criteria. LOS was found to be signifi-cantly reduced in favor of the laparoscopic approach, with a weighted mean difference of − 1.44 days, although the OR time was signifi-cantly increased, with a weighted mean difference of + 12.8 min. Laparoscopic intervention was associated with a significantly reduced complication rate compared to the open approach (10.6 vs. 15.6 % ). Total hospital costs of the laparoscopic approaches were found to be insignifi-cantly increased compared to the open techniques. Conclusion: This review further supports the use of minimally invasive surgery (MIS) in pediatric populations, demonstrating that the three types laparoscopic procedures reviewed resulted in better patient outcomes compared to open procedures, in the form of reduced LOS and over-all complication rates. Increased utilization of this approach may prove benefi-cial to pediatric patients.""

P20. Results / Results of individual studies: For all outcomes considered (benefits or harms), present, for each study: (a) simple summary data for each intervention group (b) effect estimates and confidence intervals, ideally with a forest plot.

* Quote: ""Based on the literature, curvature should be addressed stepwise starting with ventral dissection that extends underneath the urethral plate (urethral plate mobilization). Contrary to former practice, urethral plate division seems to have more of a role if significant curvature persists. Dorsal plication seems sufficient to correct only minor degrees of curvature, while a minority of cases require ventral lengthening.""
* Reasoning: The text presents the results of individual studies, but it does not provide simple summary data for each intervention group or effect estimates and confidence intervals.
* Response: [No]

P21. Results / Synthesis of results: Present results of each meta-analysis done, including confidence intervals and measures of consistency.

* Quote: Not applicable.
* Reasoning: The text does not present results of each meta-analysis.
* Response: [NA]

P22. Results / Risk of bias across studies: Present results of any assessment of risk of bias that may affect the cumulative evidence (see Item P15).

* Quote: Not applicable.
* Reasoning: The text does not present results of any assessment of risk of bias that may affect the cumulative evidence.

* Quote: Not applicable.
* Reasoning: The text does not describe or give results of additional analyses.
* Response: [NA]

P24. Discussion / Summary of evidence: Summarize the main findings including the strength of evidence for each main outcome; consider their relevance to key groups (e.g., healthcare providers, users, and policy makers).

* Quote: ""The present systematic review shows the weak evidence backing current management of primary severe hypospadias.""
* Reasoning: The text summarizes the main findings and the strength of evidence for each main outcome.
* Response: [Yes]

P25. Discussion / Limitations: Discuss limitations at study and outcome level (e.g., risk of bias), and at review-level (e.g., incomplete retrieval of identified research, reporting bias).

* Quote: ""The present systematic review shows the weak evidence backing current management of primary severe hypospadias.""
* Reasoning: The text discusses limitations at study and outcome level, indicating that the review-level limitations were considered.
* Response: [Yes]

P26. Discussion / Conclusions: Provide a general interpretation of the results in the context of other evidence, and implications for future research.

* Quote: ""The present systematic review shows the weak evidence backing current management of primary severe hypospadias. We even lack a clear-cut definition of severe hypospadias and associated curvature. Hence, while we developed general recommendations for treatment based on our review of available evidence, we emphasize the need to establish shared criteria for accurate preoperative or introperative patient stratification, and to define objective out- come measures and followup intervals for data reporting to make comparison of surgical approaches reliable.""
* Reasoning: The text provides a general interpretation of the results in the context of other evidence and implications for future research.
* Response: [Yes]

P27. Funding: Describe sources of funding for the systematic review and other support (e.g., supply of data); role of funders for the systematic review.

* Quote: ""The authors declare no conflict of interest.""
* Reasoning: The text states that there is no conflict of interest, indicating that sources of funding for the systematic review and other support were not provided.

AMSTAR:

A1. Was an 'a priori' design provided? The research question and inclusion criteria should be established before the conduct of the review. Note: Need to refer to a protocol, ethics approval, or pre-determined/a priori published research objectives to score a “yes.”

* Quote: ""A systematic review and meta-analysis comparing the clinical outcomes of TERPT and TAB.""
* Reasoning: The research question and inclusion criteria are established before the conduct of the review, as it is a systematic review and meta-analysis.
* Response: [Yes]

A2. Was there duplicate study selection and data extraction? There should be at least two independent data extractors and a consensus procedure for disagreements should be in place. Note: 2 people do study selection, 2 people do data extraction, consensus process or one person checks the other’s work.

* Quote: ""Each included study was independently appraised by 3 reviewers (C.Y., S.N., N.K.L.) and data were extracted and entered into a database. Any disagreements were resolved by consensus.""
* Reasoning: The reviewers independently appraised the studies and resolved any disagreements by consensus.
* Response: [Yes]

A3. Was a comprehensive literature search performed? At least two electronic sources should be searched. The report must include years and databases used (e.g., Central, EMBASE, and MEDLINE). Key words and/or MESH terms must be stated and where feasible the search strategy should be provided. All searches should be supplemented by consulting current contents, reviews, textbooks, specialized registers, or experts in the particular field of study, and by reviewing the references in the studies found. Note: If at least 2 sources + one supplementary strategy used, select “yes” (Cochrane register/Central counts as 2 sources; a grey literature search counts as supplementary).

* Quote: ""We searched all publications from August 1998 to March 2012 in the MEDLINE, EMBASE and Cochrane library databases and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register using different combinations of the following terms: 'Hirschsprung's disease', 'transanal', 'perineal approach', 'transabdominal' and 'pull-through'.""
* Reasoning: The reviewers searched at least two electronic sources (MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane library databases) and supplemented the search by reviewing the references in the studies found.
* Response: [Yes]

A4. Was the status of publication (i.e. grey literature) used as an inclusion criterion? The authors should state that they searched for reports regardless of their publication type. The authors should state whether or not they excluded any reports (from the systematic review), based on their publication status, language etc. Note: If review indicates that there was a search for 'grey literature' or 'unpublished literature', indicate 'yes'. SIGLE database, dissertations, conference proceedings, and trial registries are all considered grey for this purpose. If searching a source that contains both grey and non-grey, must specify that they were searching for grey/unpublished lit.

* Quote: ""We searched all publications from August 1998 to March 2012 in the MEDLINE, EMBASE and Cochrane library databases and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register using different combinations of the following terms: 'Hirschsprung's disease', 'transanal', 'perineal approach', 'transabdominal' and 'pull-through'.""
* Reasoning: The reviewers did not explicitly state that they searched for grey literature or unpublished literature.
* Response: [No]

A5. Was a list of studies (included and excluded) provided? A list of included and excluded studies should be provided. Note: Acceptable if the excluded studies are referenced. If there is an electronic link to the list but the link is dead, select “no.”

* Quote: ""Of 93 studies reporting the outcome of the transanal approach in treating Hirschsprung's disease, 18 studies that compared outcome after TERPT with those after TAB were eligible for inclusion in our analysis.""
* Reasoning: The reviewers provided a list of included studies, but not a list of excluded studies.
* Response: [No]

A6. Were the characteristics of the included studies provided? In an aggregated form such as a table, data from the original studies should be provided on the participants, interventions and outcomes. The ranges of characteristics in all the studies analyzed e.g., age, race, sex, relevant socioeconomic data, disease status, duration, severity, or other diseases should be reported. Note: Acceptable if not in table format as long as they are described as above.

* Quote: ""Table 1 Characteristics of studies included in the meta-analysis.""
* Reasoning: The reviewers provided the characteristics of the included studies in a table.
* Response: [Yes]

A7. Was the scientific quality of the included studies assessed and documented? 'A priori' methods of assessment should be provided (e.g., for effectiveness studies if the author(s) chose to include only randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled studies, or allocation concealment as inclusion criteria); for other types of studies alternative items will be relevant. Note: Can include use of a quality scoring tool or checklist, e.g., Jadad scale, risk of bias, sensitivity analysis, etc., or a description of quality items, with some kind of result for EACH study (“low” or “high” is fine, as long as it is clear which studies scored “low” and which scored “high”; a summary score/range for all studies is not acceptable).

* Quote: ""Each included study was independently appraised by 3 reviewers (C.Y., S.N., N.K.L.) and data were extracted and entered into a database. Any disagreements were resolved by consensus.""
* Reasoning: The reviewers assessed the scientific quality of the included studies, but did not provide a description of the quality items or results for each study.
* Response: [No]

A8. Was the scientific quality of the included studies used appropriately in formulating conclusions? The results of the methodological rigor and scientific quality should be considered in the analysis and the conclusions of the review, and explicitly stated in formulating recommendations. Note: Might say something such as 'the results should be interpreted with caution due to poor quality of included studies'. Cannot score 'yes' for this question if scored 'no' for question A7.

* Quote: ""However, more randomized controlled trials are necessary to verify the benefit of TERPT for Hirschsprung's disease.""
* Reasoning: The reviewers acknowledged the need for more randomized controlled trials to verify the benefit of TERPT for Hirschsprung's disease.
* Response: [Yes]

A9. Were the methods used to combine the findings of studies appropriate? For the pooled results, a test should be done to ensure the studies were combinable, to assess their homogeneity (i.e., Chi-squared test for homogeneity, I2 ). If heterogeneity exists a random effects model should be used and/or the clinical appropriateness of combining should be taken into consideration (i.e., is it sensible to combine?). Note: Indicate 'yes' if they mention or describe heterogeneity, i.e., if they explain that they cannot pool because of heterogeneity/variability between interventions.

* Quote: ""Statistical heterogeneity was assessed using I2 .""
* Reasoning: The reviewers assessed statistical heterogeneity using I2.
* Response: [Yes]

A10. Was the likelihood of publication bias assessed? An assessment of publication bias should include a combination of graphical aids (e.g., funnel plot, other available tests) and/or statistical tests (e.g., Egger regression test, Hedges-Olken). Note: If no test values or funnel plot included, score 'no'. Score 'yes' if mentions that publication bias could not be assessed because there were fewer than 10 included studies.

* Quote: ""Not applicable as there was no meta-analysis conducted.""
* Reasoning: The reviewers did not conduct a meta-analysis, so they could not assess publication bias.
* Response: [NA]

A11. Was the conflict of interest included? Potential sources of support should be clearly acknowledged in both the systematic review and the included studies. Note: To get a 'yes', must indicate source of funding or support for the systematic review AND for each of the included studies.

* Quote: ""Not applicable as there was no information on funding or support for the systematic review or the included studies.""
* Reasoning: The reviewers did not provide information on funding or support for the systematic review or the included studies.
* Response: [NA]

PRISMA:

P1. Title: Identify the report as a systematic review, meta-analysis, or both.

* Quote: ""Transanal endorectal pull-through versus transabdominal approach for Hirschsprung's disease: A systematic review and meta-analysis""
* Reasoning: The title identifies the report as a systematic review and meta-analysis.
* Response: [Yes]

P2. Abstract / Structured summary: Provide a structured summary including, as applicable: background; objectives; data sources; study eligibility criteria, participants, and interventions; study appraisal and synthesis methods; results; limitations; conclusions and implications of key findings; systematic review registration number.

* Response: [Yes]

P3. Introduction / Rationale: Describe the rationale for the review in the context of what is already known.

* Quote: ""Aim: Transanal endorectal pull-through (TERPT) has become popular for single-stage treatment of Hirschsprung's disease. The benefitsof TERPT over the conventional transabdominal approach(TAB)are still unclear.""
* Reasoning: The introduction describes the rationale for the review in the context of what is already known.
* Response: [Yes]

P4. Introduction / Objectives: Provide an explicit statement of questions being addressed with reference to participants, interventions, comparisons, outcomes, and study design (PICOS).

* Quote: ""Methods: Original articles published from 1998 to 2012 were searched from Medline, Embase, and Cochrane databases. Randomized controlled trials (RCT) and observational clinical studies (OCS) comparing TERPT and TAB were included. Outcomes evaluated included operative time, hospital stay and incidence of postoperative incontinence/soiling, constipation and enterocolitis.""
* Reasoning: The introduction provides an explicit statement of questions being addressed with reference to participants, interventions, comparisons, outcomes, and study design.
* Response: [Yes]

AMSTAR:

A1. Was an 'a priori' design provided? The research question and inclusion criteria should be established before the conduct of the review. Note: Need to refer to a protocol, ethics approval, or pre-determined/a priori published research objectives to score a “yes.”

* Quote: ""A systematic review and meta-analysis comparing the clinical outcomes of TERPT and TAB.""
* Reasoning: The research question and inclusion criteria are established before the conduct of the review, as it is a systematic review and meta-analysis.
* Response: [Yes]

A2. Was there duplicate study selection and data extraction? There should be at least two independent data extractors and a consensus procedure for disagreements should be in place. Note: 2 people do study selection, 2 people do data extraction, consensus process or one person checks the other’s work.

* Quote: ""Each included study was independently appraised by 3 reviewers (C.Y., S.N., N.K.L.) and data were extracted and entered into a database. Any disagreements were resolved by consensus.""
* Reasoning: The reviewers independently appraised the studies and resolved any disagreements by consensus.
* Response: [Yes]

A3. Was a comprehensive literature search performed? At least two electronic sources should be searched. The report must include years and databases used (e.g., Central, EMBASE, and MEDLINE). Key words and/or MESH terms must be stated and where feasible the search strategy should be provided. All searches should be supplemented by consulting current contents, reviews, textbooks, specialized registers, or experts in the particular field of study, and by reviewing the references in the studies found. Note: If at least 2 sources + one supplementary strategy used, select “yes” (Cochrane register/Central counts as 2 sources; a grey literature search counts as supplementary).

* Quote: ""We searched all publications from August 1998 to March 2012 in the MEDLINE, EMBASE and Cochrane library databases and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register using different combinations of the following terms: 'Hirschsprung's disease', 'transanal', 'perineal approach', 'transabdominal' and 'pull-through'.""
* Reasoning: The reviewers searched at least two electronic sources (MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane library databases) and supplemented the search by reviewing the references in the studies found.
* Response: [Yes]

A4. Was the status of publication (i.e. grey literature) used as an inclusion criterion? The authors should state that they searched for reports regardless of their publication type. The authors should state whether or not they excluded any reports (from the systematic review), based on their publication status, language etc. Note: If review indicates that there was a search for 'grey literature' or 'unpublished literature', indicate 'yes'. SIGLE database, dissertations, conference proceedings, and trial registries are all considered grey for this purpose. If searching a source that contains both grey and non-grey, must specify that they were searching for grey/unpublished lit.

* Quote: ""We searched all publications from August 1998 to March 2012 in the MEDLINE, EMBASE and Cochrane library databases and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register using different combinations of the following terms: 'Hirschsprung's disease', 'transanal', 'perineal approach', 'transabdominal' and 'pull-through'.""
* Reasoning: The reviewers did not explicitly state that they searched for grey literature or unpublished literature.
* Response: [No]

A5. Was a list of studies (included and excluded) provided? A list of included and excluded studies should be provided. Note: Acceptable if the excluded studies are referenced. If there is an electronic link to the list but the link is dead, select “no.”

* Quote: ""Of 93 studies reporting the outcome of the transanal approach in treating Hirschsprung's disease, 18 studies that compared outcome after TERPT with those after TAB were eligible for inclusion in our analysis.""
* Reasoning: The reviewers provided a list of included studies, but not a list of excluded studies.
* Response: [No]

A6. Were the characteristics of the included studies provided? In an aggregated form such as a table, data from the original studies should be provided on the participants, interventions and outcomes. The ranges of characteristics in all the studies analyzed e.g., age, race, sex, relevant socioeconomic data, disease status, duration, severity, or other diseases should be reported. Note: Acceptable if not in table format as long as they are described as above.

* Quote: ""Table 1 Characteristics of studies included in the meta-analysis.""
* Reasoning: The reviewers provided the characteristics of the included studies in a table.
* Response: [Yes]

A7. Was the scientific quality of the included studies assessed and documented? 'A priori' methods of assessment should be provided (e.g., for effectiveness studies if the author(s) chose to include only randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled studies, or allocation concealment as inclusion criteria); for other types of studies alternative items will be relevant. Note: Can include use of a quality scoring tool or checklist, e.g., Jadad scale, risk of bias, sensitivity analysis, etc., or a description of quality items, with some kind of result for EACH study (“low” or “high” is fine, as long as it is clear which studies scored “low” and which scored “high”; a summary score/range for all studies is not acceptable).

* Quote: ""Each included study was independently appraised by 3 reviewers (C.Y., S.N., N.K.L.) and data were extracted and entered into a database. Any disagreements were resolved by consensus.""
* Reasoning: The reviewers assessed the scientific quality of the included studies, but did not provide a description of the quality items or results for each study.
* Response: [No]

A8. Was the scientific quality of the included studies used appropriately in formulating conclusions? The results of the methodological rigor and scientific quality should be considered in the analysis and the conclusions of the review, and explicitly stated in formulating recommendations. Note: Might say something such as 'the results should be interpreted with caution due to poor quality of included studies'. Cannot score 'yes' for this question if scored 'no' for question A7.

* Quote: ""However, more randomized controlled trials are necessary to verify the benefit of TERPT for Hirschsprung's disease.""
* Reasoning: The reviewers acknowledged the need for more randomized controlled trials to verify the benefit of TERPT for Hirschsprung's disease.
* Response: [Yes]

A9. Were the methods used to combine the findings of studies appropriate? For the pooled results, a test should be done to ensure the studies were combinable, to assess their homogeneity (i.e., Chi-squared test for homogeneity, I2 ). If heterogeneity exists a random effects model should be used and/or the clinical appropriateness of combining should be taken into consideration (i.e., is it sensible to combine?). Note: Indicate 'yes' if they mention or describe heterogeneity, i.e., if they explain that they cannot pool because of heterogeneity/variability between interventions.

* Quote: ""Statistical heterogeneity was assessed using I2 .""
* Reasoning: The reviewers assessed statistical heterogeneity using I2.
* Response: [Yes]

A10. Was the likelihood of publication bias assessed? An assessment of publication bias should include a combination of graphical aids (e.g., funnel plot, other available tests) and/or statistical tests (e.g., Egger regression test, Hedges-Olken). Note: If no test values or funnel plot included, score 'no'. Score 'yes' if mentions that publication bias could not be assessed because there were fewer than 10 included studies.

* Quote: ""Not applicable as there was no meta-analysis conducted.""
* Reasoning: The reviewers did not conduct a meta-analysis, so they could not assess publication bias.
* Response: [NA]

A11. Was the conflict of interest included? Potential sources of support should be clearly acknowledged in both the systematic review and the included studies. Note: To get a 'yes', must indicate source of funding or support for the systematic review AND for each of the included studies.

* Quote: ""Not applicable as there was no information on funding or support for the systematic review or the included studies.""
* Reasoning: The reviewers did not provide information on funding or support for the systematic review or the included studies.

AMSTAR:

A1. Was an 'a priori' design provided? The research question and inclusion criteria should be established before the conduct of the review. Note: Need to refer to a protocol, ethics approval, or pre-determined/a priori published research objectives to score a “yes.”

* Quote: ""The publications were identified by searching the major medical databases such as MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library for relevant papers published between January 1992 and July 2012. The search strategy was as follows: (single-port or single-incision or single-access or single-site or single or one) AND (laparoscopic or laparoscopy or minimal invasive surgery) AND (appendec-tomy or appendix).""
* Reasoning: The search strategy was pre-determined, indicating an 'a priori' design.
* Response: [Yes]

A2. Was there duplicate study selection and data extraction? There should be at least two independent data extractors and a consensus procedure for disagreements should be in place. Note: 2 people do study selection, 2 people do data extraction, consensus process or one person checks the other’s work.

* Quote: ""Three researchers extracted data from each study by using a structured sheet and entered the data into a database. The extracted information comprised: author, year of publication, source journal, sample size, research design, clinical and pathological features of included patients, operative parameters (conversion rate, operative time and blood loss, surgical difficulty), postoperative recovery (time to oral intake and length of hospital stay), postoperative pain, postoperative complications (wound infection, abdominal abscess, omphalitis, umbilical hernia and ileus) and hospital charges.""
* Reasoning: Three researchers extracted data independently, indicating duplicate data extraction.
* Response: [Yes]

A3. Was a comprehensive literature search performed? At least two electronic sources should be searched. The report must include years and databases used (e.g., Central, EMBASE, and MEDLINE). Key words and/or MESH terms must be stated and where feasible the search strategy should be provided. All searches should be supplemented by consulting current contents, reviews, textbooks, specialized registers, or experts in the particular field of study, and by reviewing the references in the studies found. Note: If at least 2 sources + one supplementary strategy used, select “yes” (Cochrane register/Central counts as 2 sources; a grey literature search counts as supplementary).

* Quote: ""The publications were identified by searching the major medical databases such as MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library for relevant papers published between January 1992 and July 2012. The search strategy was as follows: (single-port or single-incision or single-access or single-site or single or one) AND (laparoscopic or laparoscopy or minimal invasive surgery) AND (appendec-tomy or appendix).""
* Reasoning: Three electronic sources were searched, and the search strategy was provided.
* Response: [Yes]

A4. Was the status of publication (i.e. grey literature) used as an inclusion criterion? The authors should state that they searched for reports regardless of their publication type. The authors should state whether or not they excluded any reports (from the systematic review), based on their publication status, language etc. Note: If review indicates that there was a search for “grey literature” or “unpublished literature,” indicate “yes.” SIGLE database, dissertations, conference proceedings, and trial registries are all considered grey for this purpose. If searching a source that contains both grey and non-grey, must specify that they were searching for grey/unpublished lit.

* Quote: ""The publications were identified by searching the major medical databases such as MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library for relevant papers published between January 1992 and July 2012. The search strategy was as follows: (single-port or single-incision or single-access or single-site or single or one) AND (laparoscopic or laparoscopy or minimal invasive surgery) AND (appendec-tomy or appendix).""
* Reasoning: The search strategy did not mention grey literature or unpublished literature.
* Response: [No]

A5. Was a list of studies (included and excluded) provided? A list of included and excluded studies should be provided. Note: Acceptable if the excluded studies are referenced. If there is an electronic link to the list but the link is dead, select “no.”

* Quote: ""The characteristics of the 17 studies (1 randomized controlled trial [22] and 16 retrospective studies [5,15–21,23–30]) are shown in Table 1.""
* Reasoning: The characteristics of the 17 included studies were provided, but the excluded studies were not listed.
* Response: [No]

A6. Were the characteristics of the included studies provided? In an aggregated form such as a table, data from the original studies should be provided on the participants, interventions and outcomes. The ranges of characteristics in all the studies analyzed e.g., age, race, sex, relevant socioeconomic data, disease status, duration, severity, or other diseases should be reported. Note: Acceptable if not in table format as long as they are described as above.

* Quote: ""The characteristics of the 17 studies (1 randomized controlled trial [22] and 16 retrospective studies [5,15–21,23–30]) are shown in Table 1.""
* Reasoning: The characteristics of the 17 included studies were provided in Table 1.
* Response: [Yes]

A7. Was the scientific quality of the included studies assessed and documented? 'A priori' methods of assessment should be provided (e.g., for effectiveness studies if the author(s) chose to include only randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled studies, or allocation concealment as inclusion criteria); for other types of studies alternative items will be relevant. Note: Can include use of a quality scoring tool or checklist, e.g., Jadad scale, risk of bias, sensitivity analysis, etc., or a description of quality items, with some kind of result for EACH study (“low” or “high” is fine, as long as it is clear which studies scored “low” and which scored “high”; a summary score/range for all studies is not acceptable).

* Quote: ""Quality assessment of the reported studies is shown in Table 2, and 12 studies had a score of more than 6 points [5,15–17,20–23,25,26,28,30], 5 studies had a score of 5 points [18,19,24,27,29].""
* Reasoning: The scientific quality of the included studies was assessed and documented using a star scoring system based on criteria related to study design, comparability of patient groups, and outcome assessment.
* Response: [Yes]

A8. Was the scientific quality of the included studies used appropriately in formulating conclusions? The results of the methodological rigor and scientific quality should be considered in the analysis and the conclusions of the review, and explicitly stated in formulating recommendations. Note: Might say something such as “the results should be interpreted with caution due to poor quality of included studies.” Cannot score “yes” for this question if scored “no” for question A7.

* Quote: ""In conclusion, this study suggests that SILA is a safe technical alternative to TILA for patients with appendicitis. It involves significantly shorter hospital stay and possible improvement in cosmesis [22], and comparable operative time, blood loss, postoperative recovery, postoperative pain and complications with TILA. The drawback is that SILA is associated with higher conversion rate, and perhaps more surgical difficulty and hospitalization costs. Most of the studies included in our meta-analysis were retrospective studies, which could have led to some selection bias. Therefore, more well-designed, multicenter, prospective randomized controlled trials are expected to be published to allow for a more convincing evaluation.""
* Reasoning: The scientific quality of the included studies was considered in formulating conclusions.
* Response: [Yes]

A9. Were the methods used to combine the findings of studies appropriate? For the pooled results, a test should be done to ensure the studies were combinable, to assess their homogeneity (i.e., Chi-squared test for homogeneity, I2 ). If heterogeneity exists a random effects model should be used and/or the clinical appropriateness of combining should be taken into consideration (i.e., is it sensible to combine?). Note: Indicate “yes” if they mention or describe heterogeneity, i.e., if they explain that they cannot pool because of heterogeneity/variability between interventions.

* Quote: ""The heterogeneity was evident, therefore, the random-effect model was used to combine the data. In the pooled data, there were no significant differences in the time to oral intake between SILA and TILA (WMD: − 0.15, 95% CI: − 0.41 to 0.11, P = 0.25, Fig. 3A). The length of hospital stay was significantly shorter in SILA than in TILA (WMD, − 0.19; 95% CI: − 0.36 to − 0.01; P = 0.03) (Fig. 3B).""
* Reasoning: The methods used to combine the findings of studies were appropriate, and the heterogeneity was taken into consideration.
* Response: [Yes]

A10. Was the likelihood of publication bias assessed? An assessment of publication bias should include a combination of graphical aids (e.g., funnel plot, other available tests) and/or statistical tests (e.g., Egger regression test, Hedges-Olken). Note: If no test values or funnel plot included, score “no”. Score “yes” if mentions that publication bias could not be assessed because there were fewer than 10 included studies.

* Quote: ""The funnel plot of standard of error by effect size for the measurements of wound infection, showed an equal distribution of studies around the middle line, indicating that publication bias was not evident (Fig. 6).""
* Reasoning: The likelihood of publication bias was assessed using a funnel plot.
* Response: [Yes]

A11. Was the conflict of interest included? Potential sources of support should be clearly acknowledged in both the systematic review and the included studies. Note: To get a “yes,” must indicate source of funding or support for the systematic review AND for each of the included studies.

* Quote: ""Jie Ding, Yu Xia, Zhong-min Zhang, Guo-qing Liao, Yang Pan, Sheng Liu, Yi Zhang and Zhongshu Yan have no conflicts of interest of financial ties to disclose.""
* Reasoning: The conflict of interest was not included for the systematic review or the included studies.
* Response: [No]

* Quote: ""Abstract Background: This meta-analysis was designed to investigate the safety and efficacy of single-incision laparoscopic appendicectomy (SILA) and three-incision laparoscopic appendicectomy (TILA) in the treatment of appendicitis. Materials and Methods: Studies published since 1992 that compared SILA versus TILA in laparoscopic appendicectomy were collected. Data on operative parameters, postoperative recovery, postoperative pain and complications, and hospitalization costs for SILA and TILA were meta-analyzed using fixed-effect and random-effect models. Results: Seventeen studies (1 randomized controlled trial and 16 retrospective studies) that included 1809 patients were studied. Of these patients, 793 and 1016 had undergone SILA and TILA, respectively. There was significantly shorter length of hospital stay; however, there were evidently higher conversion rate, and perhaps higher surgical difficulty and hospitalization costs for SILA compared with TILA. Other outcome variables such as operative time, blood loss, time to first oral intake, postoperative pain and complications were not found to be statistically significant for either group. Conclusions: Compared with TILA, SILA has the advantage of shorter hospital stay, and it can achieve comparable operative time, blood loss, postoperative recovery, postoperative pain and complications with TILA. The drawback is that SILA is associated with higher conversion rate, and perhaps higher surgical difficulty and hospitalization costs. Whether it can achieve improvement in cosmesis remains to be confirmed.""

AMSTAR:

A1. Was an 'a priori' design provided? The research question and inclusion criteria should be established before the conduct of the review. Note: Need to refer to a protocol, ethics approval, or pre-determined/a priori published research objectives to score a “yes.”

* Quote: ""The publications were identified by searching the major medical databases such as MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library for relevant papers published between January 1992 and July 2012. The search strategy was as follows: (single-port or single-incision or single-access or single-site or single or one) AND (laparoscopic or laparoscopy or minimal invasive surgery) AND (appendec-tomy or appendix).""
* Reasoning: The search strategy was pre-determined, indicating an 'a priori' design.
* Response: [Yes]

A2. Was there duplicate study selection and data extraction? There should be at least two independent data extractors and a consensus procedure for disagreements should be in place. Note: 2 people do study selection, 2 people do data extraction, consensus process or one person checks the other’s work.

* Quote: ""Three researchers extracted data from each study by using a structured sheet and entered the data into a database. The extracted information comprised: author, year of publication, source journal, sample size, research design, clinical and pathological features of included patients, operative parameters (conversion rate, operative time and blood loss, surgical difficulty), postoperative recovery (time to oral intake and length of hospital stay), postoperative pain, postoperative complications (wound infection, abdominal abscess, omphalitis, umbilical hernia and ileus) and hospital charges.""
* Reasoning: Three researchers extracted data independently, indicating duplicate data extraction.
* Response: [Yes]

A3. Was a comprehensive literature search performed? At least two electronic sources should be searched. The report must include years and databases used (e.g., Central, EMBASE, and MEDLINE). Key words and/or MESH terms must be stated and where feasible the search strategy should be provided. All searches should be supplemented by consulting current contents, reviews, textbooks, specialized registers, or experts in the particular field of study, and by reviewing the references in the studies found. Note: If at least 2 sources + one supplementary strategy used, select “yes” (Cochrane register/Central counts as 2 sources; a grey literature search counts as supplementary).

* Quote: ""The publications were identified by searching the major medical databases such as MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library for relevant papers published between January 1992 and July 2012. The search strategy was as follows: (single-port or single-incision or single-access or single-site or single or one) AND (laparoscopic or laparoscopy or minimal invasive surgery) AND (appendec-tomy or appendix).""
* Reasoning: Three electronic sources were searched, and the search strategy was provided.
* Response: [Yes]

A4. Was the status of publication (i.e. grey literature) used as an inclusion criterion? The authors should state that they searched for reports regardless of their publication type. The authors should state whether or not they excluded any reports (from the systematic review), based on their publication status, language etc. Note: If review indicates that there was a search for “grey literature” or “unpublished literature,” indicate “yes.” SIGLE database, dissertations, conference proceedings, and trial registries are all considered grey for this purpose. If searching a source that contains both grey and non-grey, must specify that they were searching for grey/unpublished lit.

* Quote: ""The characteristics of the 17 studies (1 randomized controlled trial [22] and 16 retrospective studies [5,15–21,23–30]) are shown in Table 1.""
* Reasoning: The characteristics of the 17 included studies were provided, but the excluded studies were not listed.
* Response: [No]

A6. Were the characteristics of the included studies provided? In an aggregated form such as a table, data from the original studies should be provided on the participants, interventions and outcomes. The ranges of characteristics in all the studies analyzed e.g., age, race, sex, relevant socioeconomic data, disease status, duration, severity, or other diseases should be reported. Note: Acceptable if not in table format as long as they are described as above.

* Reasoning: The characteristics of the 17 included studies were provided in Table 1.
* Response: [Yes]

A7. Was the scientific quality of the included studies assessed and documented? 'A priori' methods of assessment should be provided (e.g., for effectiveness studies if the author(s) chose to include only randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled studies, or allocation concealment as inclusion criteria); for other types of studies alternative items will be relevant. Note: Can include use of a quality scoring tool or checklist, e.g., Jadad scale, risk of bias, sensitivity analysis, etc., or a description of quality items, with some kind of result for EACH study (“low” or “high” is fine, as long as it is clear which studies scored “low” and which scored “high”; a summary score/range for all studies is not acceptable).

* Quote: ""Quality assessment of the reported studies is shown in Table 2, and 12 studies had a score of more than 6 points [5,15–17,20–23,25,26,28,30], 5 studies had a score of 5 points [18,19,24,27,29].""

* Response: [Yes]

A8. Was the scientific quality of the included studies used appropriately in formulating conclusions? The results of the methodological rigor and scientific quality should be considered in the analysis and the conclusions of the review, and explicitly stated in formulating recommendations. Note: Might say something such as “the results should be interpreted with caution due to poor quality of included studies.” Cannot score “yes” for this question if scored “no” for question A7.

* Quote: ""In conclusion, this study suggests that SILA is a safe technical alternative to TILA for patients with appendicitis. It involves significantly shorter hospital stay and possible improvement in cosmesis [22], and comparable operative time, blood loss, postoperative recovery, postoperative pain and complications with TILA.

* Reasoning: The scientific quality of the included studies was considered in formulating conclusions.
* Response: [Yes]

A9. Were the methods used to combine the findings of studies appropriate? For the pooled results, a test should be done to ensure the studies were combinable, to assess their homogeneity (i.e., Chi-squared test for homogeneity, I2 ). If heterogeneity exists a random effects model should be used and/or the clinical appropriateness of combining should be taken into consideration (i.e., is it sensible to combine?). Note: Indicate “yes” if they mention or describe heterogeneity, i.e., if they explain that they cannot pool because of heterogeneity/variability between interventions.

* Quote: ""The heterogeneity was evident, therefore, the random-effect model was used to combine the data. In the pooled data, there were no significant differences in the time to oral intake between SILA and TILA (WMD: − 0.15, 95% CI: − 0.41 to 0.11, P = 0.25, Fig. 3A). The length of hospital stay was significantly shorter in SILA than in TILA (WMD, − 0.19; 95% CI: − 0.36 to − 0.01; P = 0.03) (Fig. 3B).""
* Reasoning: The methods used to combine the findings of studies were appropriate, and the heterogeneity was taken into consideration.
* Response: [Yes]

A10. Was the likelihood of publication bias assessed? An assessment of publication bias should include a combination of graphical aids (e.g., funnel plot, other available tests) and/or statistical tests (e.g., Egger regression test, Hedges-Olken). Note: If no test values or funnel plot included, score “no”. Score “yes” if mentions that publication bias could not be assessed because there were fewer than 10 included studies.

* Quote: ""The funnel plot of standard of error by effect size for the measurements of wound infection, showed an equal distribution of studies around the middle line, indicating that publication bias was not evident (Fig. 6).""
* Reasoning: The likelihood of publication bias was assessed using a funnel plot.
* Response: [Yes]

A11. Was the conflict of interest included? Potential sources of support should be clearly acknowledged in both the systematic review and the included studies. Note: To get a “yes,” must indicate source of funding or support for the systematic review AND for each of the included studies.

* Quote: ""Jie Ding, Yu Xia, Zhong-min Zhang, Guo-qing Liao, Yang Pan, Sheng Liu, Yi Zhang and Zhongshu Yan have no conflicts of interest of financial ties to disclose.""
* Reasoning: The conflict of interest was not included for the systematic review or the included studies.
* Response: [No]

Abstract / Structured summary: Provide a structured summary including, as applicable: background; objectives; data sources; study eligibility criteria, participants, and interventions; study appraisal and synthesis methods; results; limitations; conclusions and implications of key findings; systematic review registration number.

* Quote: ""Abstract Background: This meta-analysis was designed to investigate the safety and efficacy of single-incision laparoscopic appendicectomy (SILA) and three-incision laparoscopic appendicectomy (TILA) in the treatment of appendicitis. Materials and Methods: Studies published since 1992 that compared SILA versus TILA in laparoscopic appendicectomy were collected. Data on operative parameters, postoperative recovery, postoperative pain and complications, and hospitalization costs for SILA and TILA were meta-analyzed using fixed-effect and random-effect models. Results: Seventeen studies (1 randomized controlled trial and 16 retrospective studies) that included 1809 patients were studied. Of these patients, 793 and 1016 had undergone SILA and TILA, respectively. There was significantly shorter length of hospital stay; however, there were evidently higher conversion rate, and perhaps higher surgical difficulty and hospitalization costs for SILA compared with TILA. Other outcome variables such as operative time, blood loss, time to first oral intake, postoperative pain and complications were not found to be statistically significant for either group. Conclusions: Compared with TILA, SILA has the advantage of shorter hospital stay, and it can achieve comparable operative time, blood loss, postoperative recovery, postoperative pain and complications with TILA. The drawback is that SILA is associated with higher conversion rate, and perhaps higher surgical difficulty and hospitalization costs. Whether it can achieve improvement in cosmesis remains to be confirmed.""

AMSTAR:

A1. Was an 'a priori' design provided? The research question and inclusion criteria should be established before the conduct of the review. Note: Need to refer to a protocol, ethics approval, or pre-determined/a priori published research objectives to score a “yes.”

* Quote: ""A review of literature was performed.""
* Reasoning: There is no mention of an 'a priori' design or a protocol.
* Response: [No]

A2. Was there duplicate study selection and data extraction? There should be at least two independent data extractors and a consensus procedure for disagreements should be in place. Note: 2 people do study selection, 2 people do data extraction, consensus process or one person checks the other’s work.

* Quote: ""One reviewer (GF) screened all titles and abstracts to assess whether each report was potentially eligible for inclusion, and whether or not the full text was available. Then, the relevant full text articles of all studies, which were considered as appropriate ones, were reviewed by one researcher (GF) who evaluated the articles and extracted their data. Afterwards, two other reviewers checked the data extraction of studies to estimate reliability (SW and AN). Any disagreement during study selection and data extraction process was resolved by discussion between first author (GF) and senior authors (AM, SHC).""
* Reasoning: One reviewer screened all titles and abstracts, and one researcher reviewed and extracted data from the relevant full text articles. However, there is no mention of duplicate data extraction or a consensus procedure for disagreements.
* Response: [No]

A3. Was a comprehensive literature search performed? At least two electronic sources should be searched. The report must include years and databases used (e.g., Central, EMBASE, and MEDLINE). Key words and/or MESH terms must be stated and where feasible the search strategy should be provided. All searches should be supplemented by consulting current contents, reviews, textbooks, specialized registers, or experts in the particular field of study, and by reviewing the references in the studies found. Note: If at least 2 sources + one supplementary strategy used, select “yes” (Cochrane register/Central counts as 2 sources; a grey literature search counts as supplementary).

* Quote: ""A systematic literature search was carried out using the search terms 'bowel lengthening', 'intestinal lengthening', 'longitudinal intestinal lengthening and tailoring', 'LILT', 'Bianchi procedure', 'serial transverse enteroplasty' and 'step procedure'. The last search was done on December, 10th, 2012. The reference lists of retrieved relevant articles were also cross-screened for additional studies.""
* Reasoning: The review used multiple search terms and searched multiple electronic sources. However, the specific databases used are not mentioned.
* Response: [NA]

A4. Was the status of publication (i.e. grey literature) used as an inclusion criterion? The authors should state that they searched for reports regardless of their publication type. The authors should state whether or not they excluded any reports (from the systematic review), based on their publication status, language etc. Note: If review indicates that there was a search for 'grey literature' or 'unpublished literature', indicate 'yes'. SIGLE database, dissertations, conference proceedings, and trial registries are all considered grey for this purpose. If searching a source that contains both grey and non-grey, must specify that they were searching for grey/unpublished lit.

* Quote: ""The articles published in languages other than English or German and those articles providing insufficient data were excluded from the literature review.""
* Reasoning: The review excluded articles published in languages other than English or German, and those providing insufficient data.
* Response: [No]

A5. Was a list of studies (included and excluded) provided? A list of included and excluded studies should be provided. Note: Acceptable if the excluded studies are referenced. If there is an electronic link to the list but the link is dead, select “no.”

* Quote: ""N = 39 articles with useable information (LILT n = 24 articles, STEP n = 15 articles), including n = 472 patients (LILT n = 363 patients, STEP n = 109 patients) remained to be analyzed and are reviewed here.""
* Reasoning: The review provides a list of included studies, but not a list of excluded studies.
* Response: [No]

A6. Were the characteristics of the included studies provided? In an aggregated form such as a table, data from the original studies should be provided on the participants, interventions and outcomes. The ranges of characteristics in all the studies analyzed e.g., age, race, sex, relevant socioeconomic data, disease status, duration, severity, or other diseases should be reported. Note: Acceptable if not in table format as long as they are described as above.

* Quote: ""The distribution of LILT cases within reports was as follows: less than 5 cases [11--17], 5 to 19 cases [18--26], 20 to 50 cases [9,27--31] and more than 50 cases [8,32]. The distribution of STEP cases within reports was as follows: less than 5 procedures [3,6,33--39], 5 to 19 procedures [20,40--43] and 38 procedures [44].""
* Reasoning: The review provides some characteristics of the included studies, but not in an aggregated form such as a table.
* Response: [NA]

A7. Was the scientific quality of the included studies assessed and documented? 'A priori' methods of assessment should be provided (e.g., for effectiveness studies if the author(s) chose to include only randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled studies, or allocation concealment as inclusion criteria); for other types of studies alternative items will be relevant. Note: Can include use of a quality scoring tool or checklist, e.g., Jadad scale, risk of bias, sensitivity analysis, etc., or a description of quality items, with some kind of result for EACH study (“low” or “high” is fine, as long as it is clear which studies scored “low” and which scored “high”; a summary score/range for all studies is not acceptable).

* Quote: ""Included studies revealed significant methodological and clinical heterogeneity. Thus, a quantitative meta-analysis for diagnostic and interventional outcomes was not justified. However, mean rates for patients pre-operative data as well as for interventional success are presented to allow a cautious estimation of effectiveness.""
* Reasoning: The review did not assess and document the scientific quality of the included studies.
* Response: [No]

A8. Was the scientific quality of the included studies used appropriately in formulating conclusions? The results of the methodological rigor and scientific quality should be considered in the analysis and the conclusions of the review, and explicitly stated in formulating recommendations. Note: Might say something such as 'the results should be interpreted with caution due to poor quality of included studies'. Cannot score 'yes' for this question if scored 'no' for question A7.

* Quote: ""Included studies revealed significant methodological and clinical heterogeneity. Thus, a quantitative meta-analysis for diagnostic and interventional outcomes was not justified. However, mean rates for patients pre-operative data as well as for interventional success are presented to allow a cautious estimation of effectiveness.""
* Reasoning: The review did not use the scientific quality of the included studies appropriately in formulating conclusions.
* Response: [No]

A9. Were the methods used to combine the findings of studies appropriate? For the pooled results, a test should be done to ensure the studies were combinable, to assess their homogeneity (i.e., Chi-squared test for homogeneity, I2 ). If heterogeneity exists a random effects model should be used and/or the clinical appropriateness of combining should be taken into consideration (i.e., is it sensible to combine?). Note: Indicate 'yes' if they mention or describe heterogeneity, i.e., if they explain that they cannot pool because of heterogeneity/variability between interventions.

* Quote: ""Included studies revealed significant methodological and clinical heterogeneity. Thus, a quantitative meta-analysis for diagnostic and interventional outcomes was not justified.""
* Reasoning: The review did not use appropriate methods to combine the findings of studies.
* Response: [No]

A10. Was the likelihood of publication bias assessed? An assessment of publication bias should include a combination of graphical aids (e.g., funnel plot, other available tests) and/or statistical tests (e.g., Egger regression test, Hedges-Olken). Note: If no test values or funnel plot included, score 'no'. Score 'yes' if mentions that publication bias could not be assessed because there were fewer than 10 included studies.

* Quote: ""Included studies revealed significant methodological and clinical heterogeneity. Thus, a quantitative meta-analysis for diagnostic and interventional outcomes was not justified.""
* Reasoning: The review did not assess the likelihood of publication bias.
* Response: [No]

A11. Was the conflict of interest included? Potential sources of support should be clearly acknowledged in both the systematic review and the included studies. Note: To get a 'yes', must indicate source of funding or support for the systematic review AND for each of the included studies.

* Quote: ""The authors are very grateful to 'Heidelberger Stiftung Chirurgie' for supporting this publication.""
* Reasoning: The review only acknowledges support for the publication, but not for the systematic review or the included studies.
* Response: [No]

AMSTAR:

A1. Was an 'a priori' design provided? The research question and inclusion criteria should be established before the conduct of the review. Note: Need to refer to a protocol, ethics approval, or pre-determined/a priori published research objectives to score a “yes.”

* Quote: ""A review of literature was performed.""
* Reasoning: There is no mention of an 'a priori' design or a protocol.
* Response: [No]

A2. Was there duplicate study selection and data extraction? There should be at least two independent data extractors and a consensus procedure for disagreements should be in place. Note: 2 people do study selection, 2 people do data extraction, consensus process or one person checks the other’s work.

* Quote: ""One reviewer (GF) screened all titles and abstracts to assess whether each report was potentially eligible for inclusion, and whether or not the full text was available. Then, the relevant full text articles of all studies, which were considered as appropriate ones, were reviewed by one researcher (GF) who evaluated the articles and extracted their data. Afterwards, two other reviewers checked the data extraction of studies to estimate reliability (SW and AN). Any disagreement during study selection and data extraction process was resolved by discussion between first author (GF) and senior authors (AM, SHC).""
* Reasoning: One reviewer screened all titles and abstracts, and one researcher reviewed and extracted data from the relevant full text articles. However, there is no mention of duplicate data extraction or a consensus procedure for disagreements.
* Response: [No]

A3. Was a comprehensive literature search performed? At least two electronic sources should be searched. The report must include years and databases used (e.g., Central, EMBASE, and MEDLINE). Key words and/or MESH terms must be stated and where feasible the search strategy should be provided. All searches should be supplemented by consulting current contents, reviews, textbooks, specialized registers, or experts in the particular field of study, and by reviewing the references in the studies found. Note: If at least 2 sources + one supplementary strategy used, select “yes” (Cochrane register/Central counts as 2 sources; a grey literature search counts as supplementary).

* Quote: ""A systematic literature search was carried out using the search terms 'bowel lengthening', 'intestinal lengthening', 'longitudinal intestinal lengthening and tailoring', 'LILT', 'Bianchi procedure', 'serial transverse enteroplasty' and 'step procedure'. The last search was done on December, 10th, 2012. The reference lists of retrieved relevant articles were also cross-screened for additional studies.""
* Reasoning: The review used multiple search terms and searched multiple electronic sources. However, the specific databases used are not mentioned.
* Response: [NA]

A4. Was the status of publication (i.e. grey literature) used as an inclusion criterion? The authors should state that they searched for reports regardless of their publication type. The authors should state whether or not they excluded any reports (from the systematic review), based on their publication status, language etc. Note: If review indicates that there was a search for 'grey literature' or 'unpublished literature', indicate 'yes'. SIGLE database, dissertations, conference proceedings, and trial registries are all considered grey for this purpose. If searching a source that contains both grey and non-grey, must specify that they were searching for grey/unpublished lit.

* Quote: ""The articles published in languages other than English or German and those articles providing insufficient data were excluded from the literature review.""
* Reasoning: The review excluded articles published in languages other than English or German, and those providing insufficient data.
* Response: [No]

A5. Was a list of studies (included and excluded) provided? A list of included and excluded studies should be provided. Note: Acceptable if the excluded studies are referenced. If there is an electronic link to the list but the link is dead, select “no.”

* Quote: ""N = 39 articles with useable information (LILT n = 24 articles, STEP n = 15 articles), including n = 472 patients (LILT n = 363 patients, STEP n = 109 patients) remained to be analyzed and are reviewed here.""
* Reasoning: The review provides a list of included studies, but not a list of excluded studies.
* Response: [No]

A6. Were the characteristics of the included studies provided? In an aggregated form such as a table, data from the original studies should be provided on the participants, interventions and outcomes. The ranges of characteristics in all the studies analyzed e.g., age, race, sex, relevant socioeconomic data, disease status, duration, severity, or other diseases should be reported. Note: Acceptable if not in table format as long as they are described as above.

* Quote: ""The distribution of LILT cases within reports was as follows: less than 5 cases [11--17], 5 to 19 cases [18--26], 20 to 50 cases [9,27--31] and more than 50 cases [8,32]. The distribution of STEP cases within reports was as follows: less than 5 procedures [3,6,33--39], 5 to 19 procedures [20,40--43] and 38 procedures [44].""
* Reasoning: The review provides some characteristics of the included studies, but not in an aggregated form such as a table.
* Response: [NA]

A7. Was the scientific quality of the included studies assessed and documented? 'A priori' methods of assessment should be provided (e.g., for effectiveness studies if the author(s) chose to include only randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled studies, or allocation concealment as inclusion criteria); for other types of studies alternative items will be relevant. Note: Can include use of a quality scoring tool or checklist, e.g., Jadad scale, risk of bias, sensitivity analysis, etc., or a description of quality items, with some kind of result for EACH study (“low” or “high” is fine, as long as it is clear which studies scored “low” and which scored “high”; a summary score/range for all studies is not acceptable).

* Quote: ""Included studies revealed significant methodological and clinical heterogeneity. Thus, a quantitative meta-analysis for diagnostic and interventional outcomes was not justified. However, mean rates for patients pre-operative data as well as for interventional success are presented to allow a cautious estimation of effectiveness.""
* Reasoning: The review did not assess and document the scientific quality of the included studies.
* Response: [No]

A8. Was the scientific quality of the included studies used appropriately in formulating conclusions? The results of the methodological rigor and scientific quality should be considered in the analysis and the conclusions of the review, and explicitly stated in formulating recommendations. Note: Might say something such as 'the results should be interpreted with caution due to poor quality of included studies'. Cannot score 'yes' for this question if scored 'no' for question A7.

* Quote: ""Included studies revealed significant methodological and clinical heterogeneity. Thus, a quantitative meta-analysis for diagnostic and interventional outcomes was not justified. However, mean rates for patients pre-operative data as well as for interventional success are presented to allow a cautious estimation of effectiveness.""
* Reasoning: The review did not use the scientific quality of the included studies appropriately in formulating conclusions.
* Response: [No]

A9. Were the methods used to combine the findings of studies appropriate? For the pooled results, a test should be done to ensure the studies were combinable, to assess their homogeneity (i.e., Chi-squared test for homogeneity, I2 ). If heterogeneity exists a random effects model should be used and/or the clinical appropriateness of combining should be taken into consideration (i.e., is it sensible to combine?). Note: Indicate 'yes' if they mention or describe heterogeneity, i.e., if they explain that they cannot pool because of heterogeneity/variability between interventions.

* Quote: ""Included studies revealed significant methodological and clinical heterogeneity. Thus, a quantitative meta-analysis for diagnostic and interventional outcomes was not justified.""
* Reasoning: The review did not use appropriate methods to combine the findings of studies.
* Response: [No]

A10. Was the likelihood of publication bias assessed? An assessment of publication bias should include a combination of graphical aids (e.g., funnel plot, other available tests) and/or statistical tests (e.g., Egger regression test, Hedges-Olken). Note: If no test values or funnel plot included, score 'no'. Score 'yes' if mentions that publication bias could not be assessed because there were fewer than 10 included studies.

* Quote: ""Included studies revealed significant methodological and clinical heterogeneity. Thus, a quantitative meta-analysis for diagnostic and interventional outcomes was not justified.""
* Reasoning: The review did not assess the likelihood of publication bias.
* Response: [No]

A11. Was the conflict of interest included? Potential sources of support should be clearly acknowledged in both the systematic review and the included studies. Note: To get a 'yes', must indicate source of funding or support for the systematic review AND for each of the included studies.

* Quote: ""The authors are very grateful to 'Heidelberger Stiftung Chirurgie' for supporting this publication.""
* Reasoning: The review only acknowledges support for the publication, but not for the systematic review or the included studies.
* Response: [No]

P26. Discussion / Conclusions: Provide a general interpretation of the results in the context of other evidence, and implications for future research.

* Quote: ""Based on the present article only two series provide data about JI, and they show highly divergent results. JI appears to be a valid replacement technique when performed by experienced centers; however larger numbers are needed to assess the outcomes of this procedure. There are few centers with a wide experience in all three investigated reconstruction methods, and randomized trials are almost impossible to conduct because of the low numbers of patients. Centralization of care in dedicated centers that can offer the full range of medical, gastroenterological, and surgical treatment, including all possible reconstruction types but also different lengthening techniques (e.g., the Foker technique), seems paramount to further improve care for these patients.""

* ""Introduction: Various surgical techniques for the treatment of Hirschsprung disease (HD) have been proposed. The most relevant long-term complications of HD surgery include constipation, soiling/incontinence, enterocolitis, and anastomotic stricture. To date, there has been no randomized controlled trial evaluating the long-term outcome of OPEN surgery compared with transanal approaches with and without laparoscopy (laparoscopic-assisted transanal-endorectal pull-through [L-TERPT] and transanal-endorectal pull-through [TERPT]). We performed a systematic literature review of the long-term outcome of OPEN surgery compared with L-TERPT/TERPT. Methods: Our systematic review of the recent literature (2008 to 2012) included reports on long-term outcome of either OPEN surgery or L-TERPT/TERPT with a minimum follow-up period of 12 months. With the cumulative data, a comparative meta-analysis was performed for the outcome parameters “constipation,” “soiling/incontinence,” “enterocolitis,” and “anastomotic stricture.” Results: Functional outcome of surgical techniques for HD was highly variable. We could show a significant advantage of L-TERPT/TERPT over OPEN surgery regarding the incidence of soiling/incontinence and constipation. No differences were seen for enterocolitis and anastomotic stricture. Conclusion: Significant differences in the long-term outcome of OPEN surgery compared with L-TERPT/TERPT were identified in this review. We conclude from our data that L-TERPT/TERPT represents a valid option in the treatment of HD and might have some advantages over the OPEN techniques. However, the present data should be interpreted carefully due to limitations in the quality of the study design in most reports. Prospective, randomized, multicenter trials are urgently needed to overcome this weakness of the current literature.""

* ""Introduction: Various surgical techniques for the treatment of Hirschsprung disease (HD) have been proposed. The most relevant long-term complications of HD surgery include constipation, soiling/incontinence, enterocolitis, and anastomotic stricture. To date, there has been no randomized controlled trial evaluating the long-term outcome of OPEN surgery compared with transanal approaches with and without laparoscopy (laparoscopic-assisted transanal-endorectal pull-through [L-TERPT] and transanal-endorectal pull-through [TERPT]). We performed a systematic literature review of the long-term outcome of OPEN surgery compared with L-TERPT/TERPT. Methods: Our systematic review of the recent literature (2008 to 2012) included reports on long-term outcome of either OPEN surgery or L-TERPT/TERPT with a minimum follow-up period of 12 months. With the cumulative data, a comparative meta-analysis was performed for the outcome parameters “constipation,” “soiling/incontinence,” “enterocolitis,” and “anastomotic stricture.” Results: Functional outcome of surgical techniques for HD was highly variable. We could show a significant advantage of L-TERPT/TERPT over OPEN surgery regarding the incidence of soiling/incontinence and constipation. No differences were seen for enterocolitis and anastomotic stricture. Conclusion: Significant differences in the long-term outcome of OPEN surgery compared with L-TERPT/TERPT were identified in this review. We conclude from our data that L-TERPT/TERPT represents a valid option in the treatment of HD and might have some advantages over the OPEN techniques. However, the present data should be interpreted carefully due to limitations in the quality of the study design in most reports. Prospective, randomized, multicenter trials are urgently needed to overcome this weakness of the current literature.""

The authors should state whether or not they excluded any reports (from the systematic review), based on their publication status, language etc. Note: If review indicates that there was a search for “grey literature” or “unpublished literature,” indicate “yes.” SIGLE database, dissertations, conference proceedings, and trial registries are all considered grey for this purpose. If searching a source that contains both grey and non-grey, must specify that they were searching for grey/unpublished lit.

* Quote: ""Included were all English language prospective studies and meta-analyses, retrospective cohort studies, large case series and comparison case series.""
* Reasoning: The review did not explicitly state that they searched for reports regardless of their publication type or that they included grey literature in their search.
* Response: [No]

A5. Was a list of studies (included and excluded) provided? A list of included and excluded studies should be provided. Note: Acceptable if the excluded studies are referenced. If there is an electronic link to the list but the link is dead, select “no.”

* Quote: ""The number of chosen abstracts and articles is listed with each question separately.""
* Reasoning: The review did not provide a list of included and excluded studies.
* Response: [No]

A6. Were the characteristics of the included studies provided? In an aggregated form such as a table, data from the original studies should be provided on the participants, interventions and outcomes. The ranges of characteristics in all the studies analyzed e.g., age, race, sex, relevant socioeconomic data, disease status, duration, severity, or other diseases should be reported. Note: Acceptable if not in table format as long as they are described as above.

* Quote: ""In cases where there is a known malrotation, such as congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) or abdominal wall defects, it is unusual to perform a formal Ladd procedure as part of the initial repair of the congenital anomaly. The rate of complications from malrotation in patients with gastroschisis, omphalocele or CDH is not available in the literature.""
* Reasoning: The review provided the characteristics of the included studies in an aggregated form.
* Response: [Yes]

A7. Was the scientific quality of the included studies assessed and documented? 'A priori' methods of assessment should be provided (e.g., for effectiveness studies if the author(s) chose to include only randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled studies, or allocation concealment as inclusion criteria); for other types of studies alternative items will be relevant. Note: Can include use of a quality scoring tool or checklist, e.g., Jadad scale, risk of bias, sensitivity analysis, etc., or a description of quality items, with some kind of result for EACH study (“low” or “high” is fine, as long as it is clear which studies scored “low” and which scored “high”; a summary score/range for all studies is not acceptable).

* Quote: ""The evidence was graded and the recommendations classified based on the Oxford system.""
* Reasoning: The review assessed and documented the scientific quality of the included studies using the Oxford system.
* Response: [Yes]

A8. Was the scientific quality of the included studies used appropriately in formulating conclusions? The results of the methodological rigor and scientific quality should be considered in the analysis and the conclusions of the review, and explicitly stated in formulating recommendations. Note: Might say something such as “the results should be interpreted with caution due to poor quality of included studies.” Cannot score “yes” for this question if scored “no” for question A7.

* Quote: ""The present review revealed a paucity of prospective studies evaluating patients with malrotation, and in particular, patients with congenital heart disease and intestinal rotation abnormalities.""
* Reasoning: The review considered the scientific quality of the included studies in formulating conclusions and explicitly stated the limitations of the evidence.
* Response: [Yes]

A9. Were the methods used to combine the findings of studies appropriate? For the pooled results, a test should be done to ensure the studies were combinable, to assess their homogeneity (i.e., Chi-squared test for homogeneity, I2 ). If heterogeneity exists a random effects model should be used and/or the clinical appropriateness of combining should be taken into consideration (i.e., is it sensible to combine?). Note: Indicate “yes” if they mention or describe heterogeneity, i.e., if they explain that they cannot pool because of heterogeneity/variability between interventions.

* Quote: Not applicable.
* Reasoning: The review did not perform a meta-analysis and therefore did not combine the findings of studies.
* Response: [NA]

A10. Was the likelihood of publication bias assessed? An assessment of publication bias should include a combination of graphical aids (e.g., funnel plot, other available tests) and/or statistical tests (e.g., Egger regression test, Hedges-Olken). Note: If no test values or funnel plot included, score “no”. Score “yes” if mentions that publication bias could not be assessed because there were fewer than 10 included studies.

* Quote: Not applicable.
* Reasoning: The review did not perform a meta-analysis and therefore did not assess publication bias.
* Response: [NA]

A11. Was the conflict of interest included? Potential sources of support should be clearly acknowledged in both the systematic review and the included studies. Note: To get a “yes,” must indicate source of funding or support for the systematic review AND for each of the included studies.

* Quote: Not applicable.
* Reasoning: The review did not provide information on the conflict of interest.

* Quote: ""Abstract / Structured summary: Background: Patients with malrotation, or an intestinal rotation abnormality (IRA), can experience serious adverse events. Increasingly, asymptomatic patients are being diagnosed with malrotation incidentally. Objectives: The treatment of asymptomatic or incidentally discovered malrotation remains controversial. Methods: Data were compiled from a broad search of Medline, Cochrane, Embase and Web of Science from January 1980 through January 2013 for five questions regarding asymptomatic malrotation. Results: There is minimal evidence to support screening asymptomatic patients. Consideration may be given to operate on asymptomatic patients who are younger in age, while observation may be appropriate in the older patient. If reliably diagnosed, atypical malrotation with a broad-based mesentery and malposition of the duodenum can be observed. Regarding diagnostic imaging, the standard of care for diagnosis remains the upper gastro-intestinal contrast study (UGI), ultrasound may be useful for screening. A laparoscopic approach is safe for diagnosis and treatment of rotational abnormalities. Laparoscopy can aid in determining whether a patient has true malrotation with a narrow mesenteric stalk, has nonrotation and minimal risk for volvulus, or has atypical anatomy with malposition of the duodenum. It is reasonable to delay Ladd procedures until after palliation on patients with severe congenital heart disease. Observation can be considered with extensive education for family and caregivers and close clinical follow-up. Conclusions: There is a lack of quality data to guide the management of patients with asymptomatic malrotation. Multicenter and prospective data should be collected to better assess the risk profile for this complex group of patients. A multidisciplinary approach involving surgery, cardiology, critical care and the patient's caregivers can help guide a watchful waiting management plan in individual cases.""

Regarding diagnostic imaging, the standard of care for diagnosis remains the upper gastro-intestinal contrast study (UGI), ultrasound may be useful for screening. A laparoscopic approach is safe for diagnosis and treatment of rotational abnormalities. Laparoscopy can aid in determining whether a patient has true malrotation with a narrow mesenteric stalk, has nonrotation and minimal risk for volvulus, or has atypical anatomy with malposition of the duodenum. It is reasonable to delay Ladd procedures until after palliation on patients with severe congenital heart disease. Observation can be considered with extensive education for family and caregivers and close clinical follow-up. Conclusions: There is a lack of quality data to guide the management of patients with asymptomatic malrotation. Multicenter and prospective data should be collected to better assess the risk profile for this complex group of patients. A multidisciplinary approach involving surgery, cardiology, critical care and the patient's caregivers can help guide a watchful waiting management plan in individual cases.""

Abstract / Structured summary: Provide a structured summary including, as applicable: background; objectives; data sources; study eligibility criteria, participants, and interventions; study appraisal and synthesis methods; results; limitations; conclusions and implications of key findings; systematic review registration number.

* ""Background/purpose: Interval appendicectomy (IA) is commonly performed after successful nonoperative treatment of appendix mass (AM); although, this approach has recently been challenged. We systematically reviewed the pediatric literature with regard to the justification for this practice. Methods: Using a defined search strategy, studies were identified and data were extracted independently by 2 reviewers. Incidences of recurrent appendicitis, complications after IA, and carcinoid tumor were estimated accounting for interstudy heterogeneity. Cost and length of stay of IA were analyzed. Results: Three studies (127 cases) reporting routine nonsurgical treatment were identified; all were retrospective. There was marked interstudy heterogeneity and variable follow-up. After successful nonoperative treatment of AM, the risk of recurrent appendicitis is 20.5% (95% confidence interval [CI], 14.3%-28.4%). The incidence of complications after IA (23 studies, n = 1247) is 3.4% (95% CI, 2.2-5.1), and the incidence of carcinoid tumor found at IA (15 studies, n = 955) is 0.9% (95% CI, 0.5-1.8). No reports compared costs. Mean length of stay for IA is 3 days (range, 1-30 days). Conclusions: Prospective studies comparing routine IA with nonoperative treatment without IA in children are lacking. Available data suggest that 80% of children with AM may not need IA.

P22. Results / Risk of bias across studies: Present results of any assessment of risk of bias that may affect the cumulative evidence (see Item P15).

* Not applicable as the review did not perform a meta-analysis.
* [NA]

P23. Results / Additional analysis: Give results of additional analyses, if done (e.g., sensitivity or subgroup analyses, meta-regression).

* Not applicable as the review did not perform additional analyses.
* [NA]

P24. Discussion / Summary of evidence: Summarize the main findings including the strength of evidence for each main outcome; consider their relevance to key groups (e.g., healthcare providers, users, and policy makers).

* ""This review suggests that the risk of recurrent appendicitis is approximately 20%. Thus, if every child were to receive an IA, 4 of every 5 would not actually benefit from it. Put it another way, to prevent one child from having an episode of recurrent appendicitis, 5 interval appendicectomies would have to be performed. Furthermore, more than 3% of children would develop a complication from their IA."" (lines 78-83)
* The review summarized the main findings including the strength of evidence for each main outcome.
* [Yes]

P25. Discussion / Limitations: Discuss limitations at study and outcome level (e.g., risk of bias), and at review-level (e.g., incomplete retrieval of identified research, reporting bias).

* ""The most significant finding of this review is that, despite the relative frequency of the condition, we have been unable to identify any data comparing routine IA with a 'watchful waiting' approach nor any prospective data relating to the risk of recurrent appendicitis in children. This mirrors other areas within pediatric surgery and highlights the need for quality prospective studies to provide the evidence required to inform and support our current practice."" (lines 83-88)
* The review discussed limitations at review-level (incomplete retrieval of identified research).
* [Yes]

P26. Discussion / Conclusions: Provide a general interpretation of the results in the context of other evidence, and implications for future research.

* ""This systematic review goes some way to estimating the risks of each of these 2 approaches by providing the most up-to-date and accurate data currently available. We anticipate that these data will help to inform current practice while we set about the task of obtaining prospective data comparing the 2 approaches in a prospective randomized study."" (lines 86-90)
* The review provided a general interpretation of the results in the context of other evidence and implications for future research.
* [Yes]

P27. Funding: Describe sources of funding for the systematic review and other support (e.g., supply of data); role of funders for the systematic review.

* Not applicable as the review did not provide information on sources of funding for the systematic review and other support.
