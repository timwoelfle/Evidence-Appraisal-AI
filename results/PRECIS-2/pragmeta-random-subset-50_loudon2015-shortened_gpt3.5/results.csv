- Quote 2: ""Cosmetic outcome and quality of life (each measured at 1- and 5-yrs), and 5-year local recurrence rate will be reported in due course.""
Score: [3] The full text provides information about the duration of follow-up (median of 13 months) and mentions that cosmetic outcome and quality of life will be measured at 1- and 5-year intervals. However, it does not provide details about the frequency or intensity of follow-up visits or any specific measures in place to ensure participant compliance with follow-up.

8. Primary outcome: How relevant is it to participants?
- Quote 1: ""Primary outcome measures were positive margin and re-excision rates.""
- Quote 2: ""Resection of CSM significantly reduces positive margin and re-excision rates in patients undergoing PM.""
Score: [5] The full text clearly states that the primary outcome measures (positive margin and re-excision rates) are directly relevant to the participants. It also provides evidence that resection of CSM has a significant impact on these outcomes.

9. Primary analysis: To what extent are all data included?
- Quote 1: ""Group comparisons were made using Fisher exact or chi square tests for categorical variables and Mann–Whitney U tests for continuous variables.""
- Quote 2: ""IBM SPSS Statistics version 24.0 was used for statistical analysis.""
Score: [4] The full text mentions the statistical methods used for the primary analysis and the software used for the analysis. However, it does not provide information about whether all available data were included in the analysis or any specific measures taken to address missing data.

Quotes: ""Male patients with diastolic blood pressures averaging 115 mm Hg or above represent a high-risk group in which antihypertensive therapy exerts a significant beneficial effect."" ""Also excluded were patients with surgically curable hypertension, uremia, and concomitant fatal diseases such as carcinoma."" ""Patients with hemorrhages, exudates, or papilledema in the optic fundi, history of cerebral or subarachnoid hemorrhage, dissecting aneurysm, or congestive heart failure resistant to digitalis and mercurial diuretics were excluded.""
Reasoning: The eligibility criteria for this trial were clearly defined and focused on a specific population of male hypertensive patients with diastolic blood pressures averaging 115 mm Hg or above. The exclusion criteria were also well-defined and aimed to exclude patients with certain conditions that could confound the results. Overall, the trial had a clear focus on a specific patient population, which suggests a more pragmatic approach.
Score: [4]

2. Recruitment: How are participants recruited into the trial?
Quotes: ""Following discharge from the hospital, the patients entered a prerandomization trial period of two to four months' duration."" ""Patients were required to return all bottles of medication, at which time the tablets were counted to assess the patient's reliability."" ""Nearly one half of the patients accepted into the trial period were excluded prior to randomization because of failure to pass the above tests of reliability.""
Reasoning: The recruitment process involved a prerandomization trial period during which patients were assessed for their reliability and adherence to the protocol. Patients were required to return medication bottles and undergo tablet counts to assess their reliability. The trial had a rigorous screening process to ensure that only reliable and adherent patients were included. This suggests a more explanatory approach to recruitment.
Score: [2]

3. Setting: Where is the trial being done?
Quotes: ""The study was terminated in the 115 mm Hg and above group at an earlier date than expected when it became apparent that the risk rate increased sharply at these levels of diastolic blood pressure and that the clinical course of such patients appeared to be favorably influenced by antihypertensive drug treatment."" ""The patients visited the clinic at monthly intervals for the first two months following randomization and at bimonthly intervals henceforth.""
Reasoning: The trial was conducted in multiple clinics, as patients visited the clinic at regular intervals for follow-up. The decision to terminate the study in the high-risk group with diastolic blood pressures of 115 mm Hg and above suggests that the trial was conducted in a setting where patients with this level of hypertension would typically receive treatment. This indicates a more pragmatic approach to the choice of setting.
Score: [4]

4. Organisation: What expertise and resources are needed to deliver the intervention?
Quotes: ""Treatment was begun with either tablet A, one twice daily, plus the 25-mg tablet B, one tablet three times daily, or else with the placebos of both of these tablets."" ""Dosages were reduced in the remaining patients because of low blood pressure levels with the standard regimen or because of side effects such as severe headache or weakness.""
Reasoning: The intervention involved the administration of specific tablets (tablet A and tablet B) at specified dosages. The dosages could be adjusted based on the patient's blood pressure levels or side effects. The intervention did not require additional resources or expertise beyond the administration of the tablets. This suggests a more pragmatic approach to the organization of care.
Score: [5]

5. Flexibility (delivery): How should the intervention be delivered?
Quotes: ""Treatment was begun with either tablet A, one twice daily, plus the 25-mg tablet B, one tablet three times daily, or else with the placebos of both of these tablets."" ""Thus, the regular maintenance daily dose to patients randomized to the active regimen was 100 mg of hydrochlorothiazide, 0.2 mg of reserpine, and 150 mg of hydralazine hydrochloride.""
Reasoning: The intervention was delivered through the administration of specific tablets at specified dosages. The protocol did not provide rigid instructions on how the intervention should be delivered beyond the dosage instructions. This suggests a more pragmatic approach to the delivery of the intervention.
Score: [5]

6. Flexibility (adherence): What measures are in place to ensure participants adhere to the intervention?
Quotes: ""Patients were required to return all bottles of medication, at which time the tablets were counted to assess the patient's reliability."" ""To qualify for admission to the study, the patients were required to have no 'violations' on two successive clinic visits.""
Reasoning: The trial had measures in place to assess and ensure patient adherence to the intervention. Patients were required to return medication bottles for tablet counts, and their reliability was assessed based on their adherence to the protocol. This suggests a more explanatory approach to adherence.
Score: [2]

7. Follow-up: How closely are participants followed up?
Quotes: ""The patients visited the clinic at monthly intervals for the first two months following randomization and at bimonthly intervals henceforth."" ""Tablet counts were made at all clinic visits and fluorescence tests of the urine were made at alternate visits.""
Reasoning: Participants were followed up regularly at clinic visits, with more frequent visits in the initial months and less frequent visits thereafter. Tablet counts and urine tests were conducted at these visits to monitor adherence. The follow-up schedule and assessments were consistent with usual care for hypertensive patients. This suggests a more pragmatic approach to follow-up.
Score: [4]

8. Primary outcome: How relevant is it to participants?
Quotes: ""An investigation of this type was initiated by the Veterans Administration Cooperative Study Group on Antihypertensive Agents in 1963."" ""The present report is concerned with the results obtained in the patients without signs of accelerated hypertension at admission whose diastolic blood pressures prior to treatment averaged 115 through 129 mm Hg.""
Reasoning: The primary outcome of the trial was the occurrence of severe complications and mortality in patients with diastolic blood pressures averaging 115 mm Hg or above. This outcome is directly relevant to the participants as it measures the impact of the intervention on their health and well-being. This suggests a more pragmatic approach to the choice of primary outcome.
Score: [5]

9. Primary analysis: To what extent are all data included?
Quotes: ""Changes in systolic (left) and diastolic blood pressure (right) after four months of treatment in 57 patients given placebos (above) and 68 patients treated with hydrochlorothiazide plus reserpine plus hydralazine (below)."" ""As shown in Table 4 assessable morbid events occurred in 27 placebo-treated versus two actively treated patients.""
Reasoning: The primary analysis included all available data on changes in blood pressure and the occurrence of morbid events. The results were reported for both the placebo-treated and actively treated groups. This suggests an intention-to-treat analysis approach, which is consistent with a more pragmatic design.
