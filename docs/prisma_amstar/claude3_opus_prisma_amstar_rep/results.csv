""Minimally invasive adrenalectomy in children""
The title identifies the article as a review on minimally invasive adrenalectomy in children.
[Yes]

""Purpose: Minimally invasive adrenalectomy (MIA) is the criterion standard for removal of small adrenal tumors in adults. The purpose of this review was to determine the place of MIA in children. Methods: The authors conducted a systematic review of the pediatric and adult literature about MIA, focusing on the technique and indications. Results: Minimally invasive adrenalectomy appears superior to open adrenalectomy for small tumors. The potential advantages of MIA are appealing for postoperative pain, risk of intestinal obstruction, and quality of scars. The most common approach is the transperitoneal lateral laparoscopy, which allows for a large working space. For small tumors or for bilateral adrenalectomy, the prone retroperitoneoscopy is a promising new technique. In children, the learning curve is an issue because the indications are rare. The most common indication is neuroblastoma without image-defined surgical risk factors. The incidence of local recurrence is low, but the follow-up is short in most cases. Conclusions: Minimally invasive adrenalectomy is promising for removal of small adrenal tumors. Long-term follow-up is required to evaluate the efficacy of MIA in neuroblastomas. Benign diseases are excellent candidates for this minimally invasive technique.""

Methods: PUBMED, Web of science and Cochrane library were searched until Oct. 2014 to find eligible studies. WMD, OR, RD and their 95% CIs were used to estimate the difference. Baseline such as age, gender and crossing vessel, perioperative outcomes such as length of stay, operative time, overall complications, and success rate were compared. All the meta-analyses were performed in Revman 5.2. Results: 15 comparative studies and one RCT were eligible and included in the meta-analysis. Compared with OP, LP groups might be associated with shorted length of hospital stay (WMD: -1.92, 95% CI: -2.45–1.39), reduced complications (OR: 0.71, 95% CI: 0.49-1.01) and equal success rate (RD: 0.01, 95% CI: -0.02-0.04), but prolonged operative time (WMD: 48.64, 95% CI: 31.16-66.12).

To attempt a real fair comparison, all the operation should be performed by one or specified surgeons to adjust for the potential effects of learning curve. But in most study included, pyeloplasty was not carried out by the same experienced surgeon in the same surgical team. This may bias our results in a certain degree.""

Reasoning: The main findings, including the strength of evidence for each main outcome, were summarized with relevance to key groups like healthcare providers and policymakers.
[Yes]

P25
Quote: ""There are several limitations which should be taken into account. Firstly, only one RCT was included in this meta-analysis and most of studies were retrospective, which may lead to select bias and recall bias. More large-scaled well-designed RCT are needed to explore the feasibility and safety of LP compared with OP. Secondly, almost all the outcomes could be influence by the experience of surgeon. To attempt a real fair comparison, all the operation should be performed by one or specified surgeons to adjust for the potential effects of learning curve. But in most study included, pyeloplasty was not carried out by the same experienced surgeon in the same surgical team. This may bias our results in a certain degree.""
Reasoning: Limitations at the study and outcome level (e.g. risk of bias) and at the review level (e.g. only one RCT included) were discussed.
[Yes]

P26
Quote: ""Our findings of this meta-analysis revealed that LP groups were with less length of hospital stay and lower complication rate than OP groups. Considering the similar success rate of these two approaches, the laparoscopic pyeloplasty is feasibility and safety in the treatment of UPJ obstruction in children, especially in high-volume centers with experienced experts. Considering the select bias and recall bias, more RCTs are required to further explore the efficiencies of LP.""

Quote: ""The analyzed data confirmed that LP has a similar rate of complications, both perioperatively and postoperatively. However, the LP group seemed to have a slightly higher rate of incomplete pyloromyotomies requiring a repeat procedure, with 6 cases occurring out of a total of 137 infants (4.38%) compared to none in the OP group (9,10). This is in line with other published series which reported an incidence of incomplete pyloromyotomies of between 2% and 8% [14-16], whereas this complication is extremely uncommon with OP procedures [17].""
Reasoning: The main findings are summarized, including the similar complication rates between LP and OP but slightly higher incomplete pyloromyotomy rate with LP.
[Yes]

P25 - Discussion / Limitations
Quote: ""As with any systematic review, the limitations of this study reflect those of the individual studies. Most relied on information from databases. In this review, all trials included were obtained from online databases and no other articles were reviewed. Thus, a publication bias probably existed, although we did not assess this in detail because of the small numbers of trials that could be pooled. The heterogeneity of some variables in this study is also worthy of comment. 3 variables (full time to feed, length of stay after surgery, operating time) exhibited significant heterogeneity, as indicated by the I2 values which were all above 50%. Possible explanations include the following factors: First, the studies were all from different centers. Second, the procedures were performed by a number of different surgeons with different levels of skill and proficiency. Third, different centers may be at different points on the learning curve for LP.""
Reasoning: Several limitations of the review are discussed, including publication bias, heterogeneity among the included studies, and differences between centers and surgeons.

Quote: ""The analyzed data confirmed that LP has a similar rate of complications, both perioperatively and postoperatively. However, the LP group seemed to have a slightly higher rate of incomplete pyloromyotomies requiring a repeat procedure, with 6 cases occurring out of a total of 137 infants (4.38%) compared to none in the OP group (9,10). This is in line with other published series which reported an incidence of incomplete pyloromyotomies of between 2% and 8% [14-16], whereas this complication is extremely uncommon with OP procedures [17].""
Reasoning: The main findings are summarized, including the similar complication rates between LP and OP but slightly higher incomplete pyloromyotomy rate with LP.
[Yes]

P25 - Discussion / Limitations
Quote: ""As with any systematic review, the limitations of this study reflect those of the individual studies. Most relied on information from databases. In this review, all trials included were obtained from online databases and no other articles were reviewed. Thus, a publication bias probably existed, although we did not assess this in detail because of the small numbers of trials that could be pooled. The heterogeneity of some variables in this study is also worthy of comment. 3 variables (full time to feed, length of stay after surgery, operating time) exhibited significant heterogeneity, as indicated by the I2 values which were all above 50%. Possible explanations include the following factors: First, the studies were all from different centers. Second, the procedures were performed by a number of different surgeons with different levels of skill and proficiency. Third, different centers may be at different points on the learning curve for LP.""
Reasoning: Several limitations of the review are discussed, including publication bias, heterogeneity among the included studies, and differences between centers and surgeons.
[Yes]

P26 - Discussion / Conclusions
Quote: ""Overall, this systematic review has shown a similar frequency of complications for LP and OP procedures. Furthermore, it also showed a trend toward shorter times for LP. Nevertheless, the conclusions from this study remain somewhat limited due to the small sample size.""
Reasoning: The conclusions provide a general interpretation of the results in the context of the limitations of the small sample size.

Reasoning: The title identifies the article as a systematic review.
[Yes]

P2
Quote: ""Background: The management of intestinal rotational abnormalities (IRA) in heterotaxy syndrome (HS) remains inconsistent. Because of the high incidence of malrotation in HS, screening of asymptomatic patients is standard of care in some institutions. The Ladd procedure is the treatment for malrotation, and has been reported to have high complication rates in HS patients.
Methods: We performed a systematic review of publications describing IRA in pediatric HS patients from January 1993 to present. The incidence of volvulus on surgical exploration was determined. Perioperative and long-term outcomes were analyzed to determine complication and mortality rates.""

P25
Quote: ""There are limitations to this review which must be considered. First, there have only been a small number of studies comparing LPE with OPE in the treatment of biliary atresia, with a lack of randomized trials. Second, the sample size of some selected studies is small so that the statistical power to detect the difference in the outcomes is limited. Third, although most of the comparative cohort studies seem to be robust, risk of selection bias still existed, as it was the surgeons' preference and experience that determined the allocation of patients to either LPE or OPE group. Fourth, marked heterogeneity for several meta-analysis, short follow-up time in some included studies, and the potentially existed significant risk of publication bias may more or less affect the accuracy of the results. Fifth, the other limitation is the length of follow-up. Our meta-analysis only compared native liver survival at 2 years post-Kasai and is, therefore, not possible to predict long-term survival (5–10 years) between LPE and OPE.""

Quote: ""Abstract Complete fundoplication (Nissen) has long been accepted as the gold standard surgical procedure in children with therapy-resistant gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD); however, increasingly more evidence has become available for partial fundoplication as an alternative. The aim of this study was to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis comparing complete versus partial fundoplication in children with therapy-resistant GERD. PubMed (1960 to 2011), EMBASE (from 1980 to 2011), and the Cochrane Library (issue 3, 2011) were systematically searched according to the PRISMA statement. Results were pooled in meta-analyses and expressed as risk ratios (RRs). In total, eight original trials comparing complete to partial fundoplication were identified. Seven of these studies had a retrospective study design. Short-term (RR 0.64; p=0.28) and long-term (RR 0.85; p=0.42) postoperative reflux control was similar for complete and partial fundoplication. Dysphagia occurred significantly more often after complete fundoplication (RR 2.56; p=0.007) than partial fundoplication. This systematic review and meta-analysis showed that reflux control is similar after both complete and partial fundoplication, while partial fundoplication significantly reduces the number of dilatations to treat severe dysphagia. However, because of the lack of a well-designed study, we have to be cautious in making definitive conclusions. To decide which type of fundoplication is the best practice in pediatric GERD patients, more randomized controlled trials comparing complete to partial fundoplication in children with GERD are warranted.""

Quote: ""Abstract Complete fundoplication (Nissen) has long been accepted as the gold standard surgical procedure in children with therapy-resistant gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD); however, increasingly more evidence has become available for partial fundoplication as an alternative. The aim of this study was to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis comparing complete versus partial fundoplication in children with therapy-resistant GERD. PubMed (1960 to 2011), EMBASE (from 1980 to 2011), and the Cochrane Library (issue 3, 2011) were systematically searched according to the PRISMA statement. Results were pooled in meta-analyses and expressed as risk ratios (RRs). In total, eight original trials comparing complete to partial fundoplication were identified. Seven of these studies had a retrospective study design. Short-term (RR 0.64; p=0.28) and long-term (RR 0.85; p=0.42) postoperative reflux control was similar for complete and partial fundoplication. Dysphagia occurred significantly more often after complete fundoplication (RR 2.56; p=0.007) than partial fundoplication. This systematic review and meta-analysis showed that reflux control is similar after both complete and partial fundoplication, while partial fundoplication significantly reduces the number of dilatations to treat severe dysphagia. However, because of the lack of a well-designed study, we have to be cautious in making definitive conclusions. To decide which type of fundoplication is the best practice in pediatric GERD patients, more randomized controlled trials comparing complete to partial fundoplication in children with GERD are warranted.""

P24 - Discussion: Summary of evidence
Quote: ""Our systematic review identified more than 1,000 publications after searching the available databases for pediatric ARS. Most of these articles were found to be retrospective studies or case reports. Only 17 prospective, longitudinal studies, using reflux symptom scores and/or GE tests could be identified that described the outcome of ARS in pediatric GERD patients. This indicates that the vast majority of studies on pediatric ARS are of poor quality.""

""We have also found that when all the patients are analyzed, there is no difference between the IAA incidences following either LA or OA in a pediatric patient. This is in contrast to the findings of the Cochrane review.3""
The main findings are summarized, including their relevance to key groups.
[Yes]

P25. Discussion / Limitations
Quote: ""There is also a protective effect of using the laparoscopic technique in terms of the occurrence of WI or SBO in the postoperative period. The subset analysis revealed that there is a greater incidence of IAA formation following LA in patients presenting with complicated appendicitis. This may potentially be explained by the increased time required for a thorough washout with the LA technique, or that there may be a negative effect on the pneumoperitoneum on the intraperitoneal distribution of purulent material.12,13""
Limitations at the study and review level are discussed.
[Yes]

P26. Discussion / Conclusions
Quote: ""Overall, this systematic review of pediatric patients has shown that there is no difference between the LA and OA techniques in terms of IAA formation, which is different from the findings of the Cochrane review.3 The LA technique decreases the incidence of WI and also has a protective effect on the formation of postoperative SBO.""

[Yes]

P3. Introduction / Rationale
Quote: ""A CUTE APPENDICITIS IS A VERY COMMON pathology encountered in both pediatric and adult patient populations, with a lifetime risk of 7%–8%.1 There has been much recent research and debate over the best operative modality for an appendicectomy in a pediatric patient, despite the laparoscopic approach gaining popularity among pediatric surgeons.2 A recent Cochrane systematic review, which included both adult and pediatric studies, concluded that there was an increased incidence of intraabdominal abscess (IAA) following laparoscopic appendicectomy (LA) compared with the open approach (OA); the odds ratio (OR) was 2.48 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.45–4.21).3 There have only been a few reviews on this topic in a pediatric population and fewer that have specifically focused on the incidence of postoperative complications such as IAA, wound infection (WI), and also small bowel obstruction (SBO).4–6""
The rationale for the review is described in the context of existing evidence on the topic.

Quotes: ""Several interesting points are raised by this review. The first is that there is a scarcity of Level I evidence for the treatment of pediatric acute appendicitis by either operative modality, despite the condition being one of the most common emergencies that a pediatric surgeon will encounter.""
""We have also found that when all the patients are analyzed, there is no difference between the IAA incidences following either LA or OA in a pediatric patient. This is in contrast to the findings of the Cochrane review.3""
The main findings are summarized, including their relevance to key groups.
[Yes]

P25. Discussion / Limitations
Quote: ""There is also a protective effect of using the laparoscopic technique in terms of the occurrence of WI or SBO in the postoperative period. The subset analysis revealed that there is a greater incidence of IAA formation following LA in patients presenting with complicated appendicitis. This may potentially be explained by the increased time required for a thorough washout with the LA technique, or that there may be a negative effect on the pneumoperitoneum on the intraperitoneal distribution of purulent material.12,13""
Limitations at the study and review level are discussed.
[Yes]

P26. Discussion / Conclusions
Quote: ""Overall, this systematic review of pediatric patients has shown that there is no difference between the LA and OA techniques in terms of IAA formation, which is different from the findings of the Cochrane review.3 The LA technique decreases the incidence of WI and also has a protective effect on the formation of postoperative SBO.""

Quotes: ""So far, the major postoperative complication rate after LP for HPS is not substantially higher than after OP. Because time to full feed and postoperative hospital stay are at best a few hours shorter after LP than after OP, the laparoscopic technique might be acknowledged as the standard of care if the major postoperative complication rate is low. Hence, this laparoscopic procedure should preferably be performed in centers with pediatric surgeons with expertise in this procedure.""

[Yes]

P26
Quote: ""In any procedure that is introduced into daily surgical care, new problems can occur during and after surgery that were not recognized or foreseen by the surgeon and his team. This learning curve in the four RCTs plays an underestimated role in major complications seen in the laparoscopic group, which may also have influenced secondary outcomes such as postoperative hospital stay. In our opinion RCT that compares two procedures, the surgeon(s) should be beyond the learning curve(s) of both operations in order to make a valid comparison.""

Quotes: ""So far, the major postoperative complication rate after LP for HPS is not substantially higher than after OP. Because time to full feed and postoperative hospital stay are at best a few hours shorter after LP than after OP, the laparoscopic technique might be acknowledged as the standard of care if the major postoperative complication rate is low. Hence, this laparoscopic procedure should preferably be performed in centers with pediatric surgeons with expertise in this procedure.""
""Despite this small benefit, LP can be acknowledged as the standard of care only if the included studies were of high quality and no heterogeneity between studies was found [12] and if the included studies were randomized and are therefore at higher risk of bias.""

[Yes]

P26
Quote: ""In any procedure that is introduced into daily surgical care, new problems can occur during and after surgery that were not recognized or foreseen by the surgeon and his team. This learning curve in the four RCTs plays an underestimated role in major complications seen in the laparoscopic group, which may also have influenced secondary outcomes such as postoperative hospital stay. In our opinion RCT that compares two procedures, the surgeon(s) should be beyond the learning curve(s) of both operations in order to make a valid comparison.""
Reasoning: The authors provide a general interpretation of the results in the context of the learning curve for laparoscopic pyloromyotomy and implications for future research comparing the two procedures.
[Yes]

""This meta-analysis shows the lowest complication rates for the TIP repair when it is applied to primary distal hypospadias, with mean rates of meatal stenosis at 3.6% (range 1.7–7.4%), urethral stricture at 1.3% (range 0.8–2.2%), fistula at 5.7% (range 4.0–8.2%) and re-operation at 4.5% (range 2.7–7.5%). The fistula rate is higher than the reoperation rate as one paper reports spontaneous healing of three fistulae [24]. Several studies, including the review paper by Wilkinson et al. [66] reported a lower fistula rate but similar meatal stenosis rates, and Snodgrass reported a 2% fistula rate for the distal repairs [67]. It should be noted that the mode of evaluating complications varied between papers, with no standardised method of assessment. Performing a meta-analysis of the published data has given a pooled estimate of the complication rates assessed, by encompassing all the documented results showing that the TIP repair is a transferable technique that provides good outcomes in primary distal hypospadias.""

Fistula and re-operation rates were significantly higher in secondary repairs (15.5% and 23.3%) compared to primary proximal (10.3% and 12.2%) and primary distal (5.7% and 4.5%) (P = 0.045 and P < 0.001, respectively). Meatal stenosis rates were significantly higher in primary proximal repairs, with follow-up >1 year (12.7%). Comparison of geographical location showed that complication rates for all but one variable were significantly lower in North America when compared to Europe and the rest of the world.""
The authors assessed study quality by comparing complication rates by repair type, follow-up duration, and geographical location.

""This meta-analysis shows the lowest complication rates for the TIP repair when it is applied to primary distal hypospadias, with mean rates of meatal stenosis at 3.6% (range 1.7–7.4%), urethral stricture at 1.3% (range 0.8–2.2%), fistula at 5.7% (range 4.0–8.2%) and re-operation at 4.5% (range 2.7–7.5%). The fistula rate is higher than the reoperation rate as one paper reports spontaneous healing of three fistulae [24]. Several studies, including the review paper by Wilkinson et al. [66] reported a lower fistula rate but similar meatal stenosis rates, and Snodgrass reported a 2% fistula rate for the distal repairs [67]. It should be noted that the mode of evaluating complications varied between papers, with no standardised method of assessment. Performing a meta-analysis of the published data has given a pooled estimate of the complication rates assessed, by encompassing all the documented results showing that the TIP repair is a transferable technique that provides good outcomes in primary distal hypospadias.""
The authors consider the study quality assessment in their conclusions, noting the lowest complication rates are for primary distal repairs but acknowledging the variability in how complications were evaluated across studies.

Transanal one-stage pull-through procedure (TERPT) represents the latest development in the concept of the minimal invasive surgery for HD [3–11]. TERPT was introduced in the late 1990s by De la Torre and Ortega and has rapidly replaced traditional procedures for the management of rectosigmoid HD in many pediatric surgical centers around the world [3, 4].When compared with the traditional open laparotomy, the advantages of the TERPT are that it is a minimally invasive procedure with a short hospital stay.

Quote: ""Systematic review and meta-analysis of enterocolitis after one-stage transanal pull-through procedure for Hirschsprung's disease""  
Reasoning: The title identifies the report as a systematic review and meta-analysis.
Response: [Yes]

P2
Quote: ""Abstract Purpose The transanal one-stage pull-through procedure (TERPT) has gained worldwide popularity over open and laparoscopic-assisted one-stage techniques in children with Hirschsprung's disease (HD). It offers the advantages of avoiding laparotomy, laparoscopy, scars, abdominal contamination, and adhesions. However, enterocolitis associated with Hirschsprung's disease (HAEC) still remains to be a potentially life-threatening complication after pullthrough operation. The reported incidence of HAEC ranges from 4.6 to 54%. This meta-analysis was designed to evaluate postoperative incidence of HAEC following TERPT procedure.""
Reasoning: The abstract provides a structured summary with labeled sections for background, purpose, methods, results, and conclusions.
Response: [Yes]

P3
Quote: ""Hirschsprung's disease (HD) is the most common cause of intestinal obstruction in children [1]. Since the introduction of operative treatment of HD by Swenson [2], various operative procedures gradually evolved during the decades. Multistage surgery has progressed to open or laparoscopic-assisted one-stage repair. Transanal one-stage pull-through procedure (TERPT) represents the latest development in the concept of the minimal invasive surgery for HD [3–11]. TERPT was introduced in the late 1990s by De la Torre and Ortega and has rapidly replaced traditional procedures for the management of rectosigmoid HD in many pediatric surgical centers around the world [3, 4].When compared with the traditional open laparotomy, the advantages of the TERPT are that it is a minimally invasive procedure with a short hospital stay. It eliminates abdominal incision and avoids complications of traditional laparotomy, such as intestinal adhesion, damage to pelvic structures, and wound infection postoperatively.""

However, the majority of recent reports found the incidence of HAEC to be unrelated to type and timing of definitive surgery [15, 19, 30, 34, 36]. In the present review, postoperative HAEC occurred in 92 patients, which lead to an incidence rate of HAEC of 10.2%. The incidence of recurrent HAEC varies from 5.2 to 56% in various reported series [15, 16, 34]. Frequency of bouts of HAEC is supposed to decrease with time [37].

Quote: ""The low incidence of most of the procedures (favoring case series with low level of evidence) and the lack of uniformity in evaluating some measures among surgeons, like pain assessment or cosmesis, for example, are the main contributors to this limitation.""
Reasoning: Limitations at the study and review level are discussed.
[Yes]

P26. Discussion / Conclusions
Quote: ""A wide experience in SIPES and its feasibility have already been described with good clinical outcomes and low rate of conversion. Appendectomy is the unique procedure in which SIPES has demonstrated to be safe and effective. The majority of SIPES procedures were performed in the ""children"" and ""adolescents"" groups. Cosmesis seems to be a self-evident benefit of SIPES, although there is no objective assessment of it among authors in the literature, and it must be carefully weighed against the possibility of affecting the safety of the procedure.""

P24. Discussion / Summary of evidence
Quote: ""Although the overall effects of laparoscopic surgery for suspected appendicitis are impressive, the laparoscopic surgeons involved in these trials were well-trained experts in laparoscopy. Therefore, surgical expertise with laparoscopic techniques is a basic prerequisite before surgeons can justly expect clinical benefits from LA. The still ongoing dissemination of the various laparoscopic techniques, however, renders it likely that the majority of future surgeons will be able to obtain training more easily.""
Reasoning: The main findings are summarized, including their relevance to surgeons.
[Yes]

P25. Discussion / Limitations
Quote: ""The reduction of the rate of patients without definite diagnosis is difficult to value, since some of these patients are likely to have no serious intraabdominal disease. On the other hand, there will also be cases, in whom conventional appendectomy overlooks a serious, perhaps even malignant disease. Such cases will most likely receive a definite diagnosis within or after hospital stay. However, since most trials focused on early results (Kum 1993; Ortega 1996; Mutter 1996; Pozo 1996; Lejus 1996; Lintula 2004; Huang 2001; Ignacio 2003), did not extend follow-up beyond hospital discharge, these case of recurrent diseases could have been missed in the trials.""
Reasoning: Limitations of the review, such as short follow-up periods in most trials, are discussed.
[Yes]

P26. Discussion / Conclusions
Quote: ""In summary, laparoscopic surgery for suspected appendicitis has diagnostic and therapeutic advantages as compared to conventional surgery. However, conventional appendectomy should not be considered 'wrong', because the difference between the two techniques is rather small and strongly depends on patient characteristics and the treating surgeon's expertise.""
Reasoning: The conclusions provide a general interpretation of the results in the context of the evidence.
[Yes]

However, since most trials focused on early results (Kum 1993; Ortega 1996; Mutter 1996; Pozo 1996; Lejus 1996; Lintula 2004; Huang 2001; Ignacio 2003), did not extend follow-up beyond hospital discharge, these case of recurrent diseases could have been missed in the trials.""
Reasoning: Limitations of the review, such as short follow-up periods in most trials, are discussed.
[Yes]

P26. Discussion / Conclusions
Quote: ""In summary, laparoscopic surgery for suspected appendicitis has diagnostic and therapeutic advantages as compared to conventional surgery. However, conventional appendectomy should not be considered 'wrong', because the difference between the two techniques is rather small and strongly depends on patient characteristics and the treating surgeon's expertise.""
Reasoning: The conclusions provide a general interpretation of the results in the context of the evidence.
[Yes]

""Achalasia is a rare neuromuscular disorder of the esophagus, characterized as a syndrome of impaired relaxation of the lower esophageal sphincter (LES) and decreased peristalsis of the esophageal body. Although no cure exist that can reverse the underlying neuropathology, current treatments are aimed at symptom palliation. Management includes medication, chemical paralysis of the LES, mechanical or pneumatic dilation, endoscopic, or surgical esophagomyotomy with or without a fundoplication. Given the limited data published on pediatric achalasia, data are often limited to retrospective pediatric case series and extrapolation from the adult literature.""

""The best treatment for achalasia would result in long-term symptom palliation while minimize GERD that commonly occurs after treatment. Although there are multiple treatment options, PD and HM are currently the most efficacious and most commonly used treatments. Between 1980 and 2010, there have been seven published studies that compare these two methods for the treatment of pediatric achalasia. Although both treatment options appear safe and effective, our findings support those of Lee et al who states that the current pediatric literature has provided insufficient evidence to conclude whether PD or HM is the superior first-line treatment for pediatric achalasia.""
The authors summarize the main findings and their relevance to key groups.
[Yes]

P25
""Limitations Achalasia is a rare disorder resulting in small sample size which is further compounded by stratification of subjects into even smaller treatment groups. Additional limitations include surgeon preference as the deciding factor to proceed with a particular treatment except for in cases where patient size and/or age excluded a candidate for PD due to equipment limitations.""
The authors discuss the limitations at the study and review level.
[Yes]

P26
""Conclusion The optimal treatment algorithm for pediatric achalasia remains unclear as adequate comparative data between PD and HM are lacking. Both adult and pediatric literatures suggest that younger age may contribute to poor response to PD.

[Yes]

P25
Quote: ""Although the use of a patch seemed to be a risk factor for recurrence in ES, patch use is difficult to predict.

[Yes]  

P3. Introduction / Rationale
Quotes: ""Minimally invasive surgery (MIS) is an accepted surgical technique for the treatment of a variety of benign diseases. After the introduction of laparoscopic cholecystectomy, other surgical procedures such as appendectomy, fundoplication, splenectomy and nephrectomy were soon performed using MIS (Bax 2005; Georgeson 2000; Georgeson 2003; Johnson 1997; Schaarschmidt 2005; Ure 2000). MIS showed short-term postoperative advantages compared to open surgery including less pain, a shorter duration of postoperative ileus and better pulmonary function, all leading to a more rapid recovery and shorter hospital stay (Bax 2005; Leung 2004; Milsom 1998).""

Reasoning: The authors summarize the main finding of a lack of RCTs or CCTs on the topic.
[Yes]

P25. Discussion / Limitations
Quotes: ""High quality RCTs comparing MIS to open surgery are required. These RCTs should be performed in homogeneous study populations (for example, with regard to tumour type and stage of disease). They should have a long-term follow up and the number of included patients should be sufficient to obtain the power needed for the results to be reliable. To obtain adequate numbers of patients, centres specialising in MIS in children should collaborate.""
Reasoning: The authors discuss limitations at the review level, including the lack of RCTs and need for future high-quality trials.
[Yes]

P26. Discussion / Conclusions
Quotes: ""No randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and controlled clinical trials (CCTs) evaluating minimally invasive surgery (MIS) and open surgery for the treatment of solid intra-thoracic or intra-abdominal neoplasms in children could be identified. The current evidence base informing the use of MIS in children with solid abdominal and thoracic neoplasms is based on other study designs such as case series, retrospective chart reviews and cohort studies and should be interpreted with caution. Thus there is insufficient evidence to allow any definitive conclusions regarding overall survival, event-free survival, port-site metastases, recurrence rate and surgical morbidity associated with the use of MIS in these patients.""

After the introduction of laparoscopic cholecystectomy, other surgical procedures such as appendectomy, fundoplication, splenectomy and nephrectomy were soon performed using MIS (Bax 2005; Georgeson 2000; Georgeson 2003; Johnson 1997; Schaarschmidt 2005; Ure 2000). MIS showed short-term postoperative advantages compared to open surgery including less pain, a shorter duration of postoperative ileus and better pulmonary function, all leading to a more rapid recovery and shorter hospital stay (Bax 2005; Leung 2004; Milsom 1998).""
Reasoning: The authors provide rationale for the review by discussing the background and current state of knowledge on the topic.
[Yes]

P4. Introduction / Objectives
Quotes: ""To ascertain differences in outcome between the minimally invasive and open surgical approaches for the treatment of solid intra-abdominal or intra-thoracic neoplasms in children.

P24. Discussion / Summary of evidence
Quotes: ""No RCTs or CCTs evaluating MIS for the treatment of solid intra-thoracic or intra-abdominal neoplasms in children could be identified. The current evidence base informing the use of MIS in children with solid abdominal and thoracic neoplasms is based on other study designs like case reports, retrospective chart reviews and cohort studies and should be interpreted with caution.""
Reasoning: The authors summarize the main finding of a lack of RCTs or CCTs on the topic.
[Yes]

P25. Discussion / Limitations
Quotes: ""High quality RCTs comparing MIS to open surgery are required. These RCTs should be performed in homogeneous study populations (for example, with regard to tumour type and stage of disease). They should have a long-term follow up and the number of included patients should be sufficient to obtain the power needed for the results to be reliable. To obtain adequate numbers of patients, centres specialising in MIS in children should collaborate.""
Reasoning: The authors discuss limitations at the review level, including the lack of RCTs and need for future high-quality trials.
[Yes]

P26. Discussion / Conclusions
Quotes: ""No randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and controlled clinical trials (CCTs) evaluating minimally invasive surgery (MIS) and open surgery for the treatment of solid intra-thoracic or intra-abdominal neoplasms in children could be identified. The current evidence base informing the use of MIS in children with solid abdominal and thoracic neoplasms is based on other study designs such as case series, retrospective chart reviews and cohort studies and should be interpreted with caution. Thus there is insufficient evidence to allow any definitive conclusions regarding overall survival, event-free survival, port-site metastases, recurrence rate and surgical morbidity associated with the use of MIS in these patients.""
Reasoning: The authors provide an overall interpretation of the results in the context of the limitations and current evidence base.
[Yes]

P27. Funding

P26
Quote: ""Perhaps the most important issue to consider is that of patient selection. The authors were unable to extract enough data regarding tumor size, tumor location, or residual amount of healthy parenchyma to tease out their effects on patient selection. Previous studies by Cost et al. [15] and Ferrar et al. [42] suggest that only 25% of children with unilateral WT are candidates for NSS; however, only 1% of these children actually undergo NSS [34]. Thus, one of the goals of future research efforts should be to determine which children can safely undergo NSS. In a recent abstract, Ehrlich et al. reported on 39 patients with unilateral WT who underwent NSS. The authors found that 9/39 (23%) were found to have positive margins or intraoperative tumor spill; these patients thus would have received additional chemotherapy and radiation owing to surgical factors. Despite this, the 5-year overall survival in those patients was 96%. Although this study has to date only been reported in abstract form, the presented data seems to imply that at least some of these tumors may not have been appropriate candidates for NSS. Preoperative tumor weights in these patients ranged from 133 to 1,870 g, whereas 13 patients had Stage II or III disease. Further, based on the fact that 13/39 (33%) patients did not undergo formal lymphadenectomy as recommended, one can perhaps conclude that the surgeons involved in those cases may not have been fully up to date on standard COG guidelines [34]. NSS feasibility, however, can be aided by preoperative imaging and was associated with a sensitivity of 87%, specificity of 97%, and accuracy of 93% [43]. As noted previously, NSS is a technically demanding procedure that requires significant expertise both in patient selection and technical ability and experience.""

P26
Quote: ""Perhaps the most important issue to consider is that of patient selection. The authors were unable to extract enough data regarding tumor size, tumor location, or residual amount of healthy parenchyma to tease out their effects on patient selection. Previous studies by Cost et al. [15] and Ferrar et al. [42] suggest that only 25% of children with unilateral WT are candidates for NSS; however, only 1% of these children actually undergo NSS [34]. Thus, one of the goals of future research efforts should be to determine which children can safely undergo NSS. In a recent abstract, Ehrlich et al. reported on 39 patients with unilateral WT who underwent NSS. The authors found that 9/39 (23%) were found to have positive margins or intraoperative tumor spill; these patients thus would have received additional chemotherapy and radiation owing to surgical factors. Despite this, the 5-year overall survival in those patients was 96%. Although this study has to date only been reported in abstract form, the presented data seems to imply that at least some of these tumors may not have been appropriate candidates for NSS. Preoperative tumor weights in these patients ranged from 133 to 1,870 g, whereas 13 patients had Stage II or III disease. Further, based on the fact that 13/39 (33%) patients did not undergo formal lymphadenectomy as recommended, one can perhaps conclude that the surgeons involved in those cases may not have been fully up to date on standard COG guidelines [34]. NSS feasibility, however, can be aided by preoperative imaging and was associated with a sensitivity of 87%, specificity of 97%, and accuracy of 93% [43]. As noted previously, NSS is a technically demanding procedure that requires significant expertise both in patient selection and technical ability and experience.""

Reasoning: The primary and secondary outcomes are clearly stated.
[Yes]

P14. Methods / Synthesis of results
Quotes: ""We used common descriptive and inferential meta-analysis methods to compare incidence rates and odds ratios of MCIH events across different studies and subgroups. We investigated the association between study size and study results in funnel plots, by plotting Logit Transformed Proportion on the horizontal axis against the standard error of the study on the vertical axis [13].""
Reasoning: The meta-analysis methods are described.
[Yes]

P15. Methods / Risk of bias across studies
Quotes: ""The effect estimates along with the confidence intervals (CIs) of all studies are plotted in a forest plot.

Reasoning: The main findings are summarized.
[Yes]

P25. Discussion / Limitations
Quotes: ""Whereas most publications in the recent 10–15 years clearly state the study design (i.e. retrospective vs. prospective, length of follow-up, etc.), earlier studies often do not clearly present their study protocol and were therefore excluded by the present authors. Furthermore full copies of almost all studies published after the year 2000 were available for the present authors, whereas in earlier studies frequently only the abstract (studies before 1990) or the title (studies before 1980) were visible, which may have resulted in selective reporting. To critically evaluate the search terms used in the present review, we checked whether selected studies by 7 known (semi-) systematic reviews assessing the incidence of MCIH in children [4–6,9–12] were detected using our search terms (data not shown). Interestingly, all studies published in 1994 or later were detected by at least one of our searches (mostly by the MEDLINE search). Five of 18 studies [10,16,34,35] published between 1964 and 1993 were not detected and almost no studies published before 1964 were assessed by one of our search terms.""
Reasoning: Several important limitations are discussed, including selective reporting, incomplete retrieval of studies, and lack of quality assessment.
[Yes]

P26. Discussion / Conclusions
Quotes: ""Routine contralateral groin exploration prevents a secondary operation and hence reduces costs, the risks of a secondary anesthesia, distress to child and parents and the possibility of metachronous contralateral hernia incarceration. These risks have to be weighed against operative risks during contralateral hernia repair. Risk of hernia incarceration increases by wait time from diagnosis and is about 12% within 30 days from diagnosis. Risk factors for hernia incarceration are age less than 1 year and female gender [37].""
Reasoning: The conclusions provide implications for practice based on weighing the risks and benefits.
[Yes]

P27. Funding
Quotes: ""Source of funding: There was no funding to the present study.""

Reasoning: The authors assessed heterogeneity between studies, which is one aspect of study quality, but did not use a comprehensive quality assessment tool.
[No]

A8. Was the scientific quality of the included studies used appropriately in formulating conclusions?
Quotes: None relevant.
Reasoning: Since a comprehensive quality assessment was not done, the quality could not be incorporated into the conclusions.
[No]

A9. Were the methods used to combine the findings of studies appropriate?
Quotes: ""Depending on the result of the heterogeneity test, fixed or random effect models were used to combine the results from the different studies [15]. If homogeneity can be assumed each study gets a weight given by the reciprocal of the squared standard error. If heterogeneity needs to be taken into account, the weights are adapted accordingly and are given by the reciprocal of the sum of the squared standard error and the estimated heterogeneity variance.""
Reasoning: The authors appropriately used a fixed or random effects model depending on the presence of heterogeneity.
[Yes]

A10. Was the likelihood of publication bias assessed?
Quotes: None relevant.
Reasoning: Publication bias was not assessed.

Reasoning: The primary and secondary outcomes are clearly stated.
[Yes]

P14. Methods / Synthesis of results
Quotes: ""We used common descriptive and inferential meta-analysis methods to compare incidence rates and odds ratios of MCIH events across different studies and subgroups. We investigated the association between study size and study results in funnel plots, by plotting Logit Transformed Proportion on the horizontal axis against the standard error of the study on the vertical axis [13].""

Quote: ""This systematic review highlights a notable lack of evidence with regard to treatment outcomes in hypospadias surgery. Despite being perhaps the most common paediatric urological procedure dealt with in paediatric urology, the level of evidence on which current practice is based remains limited to level 4, i.e. case series [1].

Quote: ""Purpose: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to summarize the effect of preoperative hormonal stimulation on complication rates following proximal hypospadias repair. Materials and Methods: We comprehensively searched the published and unpublished literature between 1990 and 2010. Eligibility criteria were applied. Title, abstract and full text screening was carried out by 2 independent authors, and discrepancies were resolved by consensus. Heterogeneity between studies was tested using Cochran chi-square Q test and quantified by calculating I2. Quality appraisal of included studies was performed. Meta-analysis was conducted using a random effects model. Results: Our search yielded 288 citations, of which 11 (622 patients) met inclusion criteria and were incorporated into the systematic review. Most series were retrospective observational studies of moderate or low methodological quality. The patients who received preoperative hormonal stimulation, with intramuscular testosterone being the most commonly prescribed formulation. Four studies addressed postoperative complication rate stratified by preoperative hormonal stimulation use and were included in a meta-analysis. The odds ratio for a complication occurring with preoperative hormonal stimulation use was 1.67 (CI 0.96–2.91, p = 0.07, I2 = 0%). No persistent side effects due to preoperative hormonal stimulation were reported. Conclusions: To our knowledge this is the only systematic review and metaanalysis thus far that has critically assessed the effect of preoperative hormonal stimulation on operative outcomes after hypospadias repair. The published literature is of low quality and lacks standardized reporting of important patient and surgical details. The effect of preoperative hormonal stimulation on operative outcomes after hypospadias repair remains unclear and requires further investigation.""

Patients need to be stratified according to severity of hypospadias. Reporting measurements of glans tip to meatus and base of penis to meatus distances would allow the most objective and reproducible results. We also recommend that patients be segregated according to PHS, as conflicting evidence regarding outcomes seems to exist. Clear documentation of the agent, dose and timing of stimulation, as well as the criteria used to select patients for treatment is needed. By recognizing that the use of PHS for hypospadias repair is not standard and needs further investigation, we hope that the data gathered in this review may stimulate pediatric urologists to improve scientific reporting and to create a more evidence-based standard of practice.""

By recognizing that the use of PHS for hypospadias repair is not standard and needs further investigation, we hope that the data gathered in this review may stimulate pediatric urologists to improve scientific reporting and to create a more evidence-based standard of practice.""

Quotes: ""In recent years, LH has been evolved as a minimally invasive technique for PIH [7,8]. In some centers, inguinal hernias have been treated routinely by the laparoscopic method, which is possible to discover the contralateral inguinal orifice [15]. Recent evidences show the feasibility of laparoscopic operations for incarcerated inguinal hernia [22,23] and elective and complicated inguinal hernias [22]. Some authors prefer the reduction of incarcerated or irreducible inguinal hernia under laparoscopic control [22,24], whereas others recommend that the open operation still remains the standard treatment for an elective and uncomplicated inguinal hernia as well as for an incarcerated inguinal hernia [22].""
Reasoning: The main findings were summarized, including their relevance to key groups.
[Yes]

P25. Discussion / Limitations
Quotes: ""Although the meta-analysis result indicated no difference in recurrence rate between LH and OH, a larger series of studies with more patients and long-term follow-up is needed to better elucidation of this issue.

Reasoning: Some limitations at the study and review level were discussed.
[Yes]

P26. Discussion / Conclusions
Quotes: ""So far, only few randomized studies have assessed the medical and economical justification of LH in relation to OH in children [12,18,19,25]. After running the current literature, we found only 3 RCTs and 4 OCSs comparing the outcomes between LH and OH [9,12,13,18-21]. Prospective trial studies show that LH has short-term advantages such as better cosmesis, better recovery, and less postoperative pain [13]. Although several comparative studies and retrospective laparoscopic series also clarified the feasibility of laparoscopy in PIH repair and compared LH with OH [9,13,20,21,26], the results were not consistent because of the limited case number and varied demographic characteristics. Meta-analysis is a statistical technique for combining the findings from independent studies, which allows a comprehensive evaluation of the presence of heterogeneity [27]. In this meta-analysis, we found no significant difference in overall patients' age, sex, and affected side between LH and OH groups.""

P24. Discussion / Summary of evidence
Quotes: ""While the sutured fascial technique has been the classical method of abdominal defect closure in patients with GS, the flap ""sutureless"" closure has been increasingly adopted as a viable alternative by a growing number of surgeons for both simple and complex GS [4,8,10]. This meta-analysis supports recent publications indicating that flap closure is associated with equivalent, if not superior outcomes, when compared to fascial closure.""
Reasoning: The main findings are summarized, including their strength and relevance to key stakeholder groups.
[Yes]

P25. Discussion / Limitations
Quotes: ""While a previous investigation demonstrated no difference in surgical site infections (SSI) when comparing GS closures performed in the operating room versus the neonatal intensive care unit, concerns remain about the potential to increase infections at the site of closure if not performed under optimal conditions in the OR [30]. This meta-analysis revealed a decrease in SSI rates with the sutureless technique when compared to fascial closure. Several caveats require consideration when considering this conclusion: not all flap closures were performed in the NICU and the definition of an SSI was non-standardized across studies. Indeed, most closure sites appear erythematous and may grow skin flora if cultured; the diagnosis of a true infection is, therefore, challenging to make. Nonetheless, fascial cases act as internal controls within each study framework, suggesting that true differences likely exist favoring flap closure. This advantage may be because of the avoidance of surgical trauma to the area, although further mechanistic studies are required to clarify this issue.""
Reasoning: Limitations of the review are discussed at the study, outcome, and review level.
[Yes]

P26. Discussion / Conclusions
Quotes: ""This meta-analysis also identified a trend towards a reduction in overall ventilator days favoring flap closure (P = 0.06). A point estimate of 2.6 fewer mechanical ventilation days clearly meets the definition of clinical significance and is likely because of the important number of patients who are not intubated at all. Given the anticipated lack of difference in other short-term outcomes (mortality, length of stay and feeding parameters), this finding represents the greatest inherent advantage of the flap closure. Recent editorials have begun to identify early exposure to general anesthesia as a potential contributor to differences in long-term neurocognitive performance [31]. While the exact magnitude of the neurotoxic effects of general anesthesia is unclear and undergoing intense study [32–34], the call for deferring, delaying or avoiding anesthesia altogether is becoming harder to ignore. Similar to the ALARA (As Low As Reasonably Achievable) principle adopted by radiologists [35], it will not be long before anesthesiologists, pediatricians and neonatologists adopt a similar mantra. Irrespective of some surgeon's current preference to use general anesthesia with flap closure, this technique represents the only reasonable method to close the abdominal defect without general anesthesia.""
Reasoning: The conclusions provide an interpretation of the results in the context of other evidence and discuss implications for future practice.
[Yes]

P3. Introduction / Rationale
Quotes: ""Gastroschisis (GS) is a congenital full thickness defect of the abdominal wall that is increasing in prevalence worldwide [1,2]. Although the survival rate of neonates with GS is high, the burden of survivor morbidity remains considerable [3]. Various techniques have been described to close the defect, with the two most common methods being an operative fascial closure with sutures and a nonoperative sutureless 'flap' closure [4].""

[Yes]

P24. Discussion / Summary of evidence
Quotes: ""While the sutured fascial technique has been the classical method of abdominal defect closure in patients with GS, the flap ""sutureless"" closure has been increasingly adopted as a viable alternative by a growing number of surgeons for both simple and complex GS [4,8,10]. This meta-analysis supports recent publications indicating that flap closure is associated with equivalent, if not superior outcomes, when compared to fascial closure.""
Reasoning: The main findings are summarized, including their strength and relevance to key stakeholder groups.
[Yes]

P25. Discussion / Limitations
Quotes: ""While a previous investigation demonstrated no difference in surgical site infections (SSI) when comparing GS closures performed in the operating room versus the neonatal intensive care unit, concerns remain about the potential to increase infections at the site of closure if not performed under optimal conditions in the OR [30]. This meta-analysis revealed a decrease in SSI rates with the sutureless technique when compared to fascial closure. Several caveats require consideration when considering this conclusion: not all flap closures were performed in the NICU and the definition of an SSI was non-standardized across studies. Indeed, most closure sites appear erythematous and may grow skin flora if cultured; the diagnosis of a true infection is, therefore, challenging to make. Nonetheless, fascial cases act as internal controls within each study framework, suggesting that true differences likely exist favoring flap closure. This advantage may be because of the avoidance of surgical trauma to the area, although further mechanistic studies are required to clarify this issue.""
Reasoning: Limitations of the review are discussed at the study, outcome, and review level.
[Yes]

P26. Discussion / Conclusions
Quotes: ""This meta-analysis also identified a trend towards a reduction in overall ventilator days favoring flap closure (P = 0.06). A point estimate of 2.6 fewer mechanical ventilation days clearly meets the definition of clinical significance and is likely because of the important number of patients who are not intubated at all. Given the anticipated lack of difference in other short-term outcomes (mortality, length of stay and feeding parameters), this finding represents the greatest inherent advantage of the flap closure. Recent editorials have begun to identify early exposure to general anesthesia as a potential contributor to differences in long-term neurocognitive performance [31]. While the exact magnitude of the neurotoxic effects of general anesthesia is unclear and undergoing intense study [32–34], the call for deferring, delaying or avoiding anesthesia altogether is becoming harder to ignore. Similar to the ALARA (As Low As Reasonably Achievable) principle adopted by radiologists [35], it will not be long before anesthesiologists, pediatricians and neonatologists adopt a similar mantra. Irrespective of some surgeon's current preference to use general anesthesia with flap closure, this technique represents the only reasonable method to close the abdominal defect without general anesthesia.""
Reasoning: The conclusions provide an interpretation of the results in the context of other evidence and discuss implications for future practice.
[Yes]

P27. Funding
Quotes: ""Acknowledgements: We are indebted to Elena Guadagno, the librarian at the Montreal Children's Hospital for her help with the literature search. We also recognize Dr. Robert A.

They add that delaying treatment and allowing comorbid conditions to progress could be equally or more disadvantageous, and that in practice, most adult bariatric centres already perform adolescent surgery (73). It is argued that, in principle, treatment risks are accepted when the benefits of treatment outweigh the risks of withholding treatment, and that the use of bariatric surgery in paediatric weight management should be seen as an extension of age-related, i.e. when the risks of chronic comorbidities should outweigh the risks of surgery for patients at any age.""

Quote: ""One in 5000 infants is born with an ARM. The evolution of surgical techniques for dealing with this complex group of malformations led to the description of the PSARP by deVries and Pena [18] in 1982. Posterior sagittal anorectoplasty quickly became the standard of care for dealing with ARM. Despite the excellent exposure of anatomy and exact placement of the distal rectum within the muscle complex, the technique is not perfect, especially in patients with ""high"" ARM defects [19–21].""
Reasoning: Key findings are summarized but strength of evidence is not explicitly stated.
[No]

P25. Discussion / Limitations
Quote: ""As a result, widespread adoption of the LAARP by the pediatric surgery community has taken place in recent years.

Quote: ""There is growing interest in the use of a resuscitative endovascular balloon occlusion of the aorta (REBOA) to control hemorrhagic shock in trauma patients. To our knowledge, the REBOA remains a new and still controversial tool. There are limited reports regarding its use in trauma patients. Recently, Brenner et al. tested the technical feasibility of REBOA in adult patients in hemorrhagic shock [25]. Although they concluded it is feasible to use, their technique is during the initial phase of aneurysm. Some believe its main use in trauma could be for placement by emergency medical personnel to temporize a patient prior to transfer to definitive care.""

Quotes: ""Our results would appear to suggest a potential benefit to OPFC over SR. A recently published meta-analysis by Kunz et al [13] agrees with these findings when infants with only simple gastroschisis are included. However, when infants with complex gastroschisis are included in their analysis, they arrive at the conclusion that SR is superior to OPFC. This variation in conclusion highlights one of the key limitations of performing meta-analysis in small specialties. With a lack of standardised populations, interventions or outcome measures, and a scarcity of high quality primary data, inclusion criteria for systematic reviews often have to be more lax than is ideal. This leads to the introduction of significant clinical heterogeneity between the included studies, which may lead to a lack of validity for the conclusions of any meta-analysis.""

A9
Quotes: ""Data were synthesized using standard methods as described in the Cochrane Reviewers Handbook [8]. The chi-squared test for heterogeneity was used to assess the extent to which the results of the studies were in agreement.

Dichotomous outcomes were meta-analysed using Mantel–Haenszel fixed effects methods to produce summary odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals. Continuous variables were meta-analysed using the inverse-variance fixed-effect method to produce weighted mean differences and 95% confidence intervals.""

P26. Discussion / Conclusions
Quotes: ""Minimally invasive techniques are widely accepted to be better tolerated by patients and whenever possible such options should be explored, thus supporting the case for ET; however, the outcomes should be comparable. Several authors have used a variety of techniques for ET, summarized above, all hoping to achieve better outcomes. There have been three literature reviews on ET. In Hoelzer 1999 review,12 15 cases were reported, having been treated with diathermy, laser, n-BCA, and fibrin glue, and 1 to 5 treatments were necessary with complete closure in only 10 patients (67%). Meier et al in 200726 reported an overall success rate of 60% of 62 patients culled from the literature (fibrin glue 55% [n = 22], n-BCA 48% [n = 29], laser 80% [n = 5], diathermy 50% [n = 10], n-BCA + sclerosant100% [n = 5]); the mean number of applications ranged from 1 to 5.5. They concluded that ET is safe, effective, has less morbidity than OS and recommended fibrin glue but advised close follow-up. Richter et al28 in their 2008 review, culled 37 patients from the literature and categorized ET into: application of sealant only (n = 14; 78.6% success), de-epithelialization of the fistula tract only (n = 8; 62.5% success), de-epithelialization combined with sealant (n = 15; 93.3%). Overall there was an 81.1% success rate (48.6% after a single attempt) and they concluded that de-epithelialization with diathermy combined with fibrin glue sealant will yield the best results; fibrin glue by nature would work better if the opposing surfaces are closely apposed and not epithelialized.21 The failures seen with ET may be partly because the sealants fibrin glue and n-BCA are biodegradable. Aproninin, an antifibrinolytic, prolongs the stability of fibrin glue in vivo for up to 10 days only96; however, the fibrin clot formed has a loose scaffold that encourages in-growth of fibroblasts. n-BCA, commonly used for skin closure, is not recommended for mucosal application by most manufacturers, as its stability and possible absorption in such environments is not yet fully determined. Willets et al (1998)55 also appreciating the possibility of late refistulation after ET, and the limited follow-up period of the reported cases managed endoscopically, decided to evaluate the long-term outcome of these patients by contacting the respective authors. They concluded that of 22 patients initially reported to have had successful ET, only 12 (55%) remained closed after a median follow-up of 107 months; there was however no morbidity or mortality directly related to these procedures.""

P3. Introduction / Rationale
Quotes: ""The global prevalence of obesity is rising in children and adolescents (1). In the United Kingdom, e.g. among individuals aged 11-15 years, the prevalence was 14.7% in 1995 and 18.3% in the 2010 round of the National Child Measurement Programme (2). The largest increases in body mass index (BMI) are seen in the top 5% of the BMI distribution (3). Treatment guidelines for obese children from National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) recommend lifestyle intervention support, assessment of co-morbidities, and referral to secondary care if morbidities are present (3,4). Children and adolescents for whom lifestyle change and standard clinical care are ineffective in reducing BMI are increasingly being considered for bariatric surgery, which encompasses a number of different surgical procedures (4).""
Reasoning: The introduction describes the rationale for the review in the context of rising childhood obesity prevalence and treatment guidelines.

Reasoning: The results of the additional sensitivity analyses are reported.
[Yes]

P24. Discussion / Summary of evidence
Quotes: ""Bariatric surgery in adolescents results in similar short-term weight outcomes to adults, with RYGB producing the greatest weight loss with the most robust evidence base. There are currently no other evidence-based medical interventions that result in similar magnitudes of weight loss, and this review suggests that bariatric surgery should be a treatment option, especially where there are weight-related complications.""
Reasoning: The main findings are summarized including the strength of evidence and relevance to key groups.
[Yes]

P25. Discussion / Limitations
Quotes: ""As bariatric surgery seems to be associated with a risk of complications and has the potential to impact on different patterns for a lifetime, a balance must be made between the potential benefits and harms at an individual case level. Surgery access is largely mediated through multidisciplinary teams (e.g. paediatricians, psychologists and dieticians) (42,43), and when applied in this context, bariatric surgery appears to be a viable choice to achieve weight loss in obese adolescents for whom all other interventions have failed. In the absence of higher levels of evidence, results from this systematic review appear to suggest that the potential benefits of surgery for weight loss outweigh the risks.""
Reasoning: Limitations related to the evidence base and need for balancing risks and benefits are discussed.
[Yes]

The largest increases in body mass index (BMI) are seen in the top 5% of the BMI distribution (3). Treatment guidelines for obese children from National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) recommend lifestyle intervention support, assessment of co-morbidities, and referral to secondary care if morbidities are present (3,4). Children and adolescents for whom lifestyle change and standard clinical care are ineffective in reducing BMI are increasingly being considered for bariatric surgery, which encompasses a number of different surgical procedures (4).""
Reasoning: The introduction describes the rationale for the review in the context of rising childhood obesity prevalence and treatment guidelines.
[Yes]

P4. Introduction / Objectives

P13. Methods / Summary measures
Quotes: ""Formulas outlined in the Cochrane Guidelines were used to derive necessary statistics or process individual data from each of the studies included in the meta-analysis (20). Median BMI estimates were not included in our review as variances are needed to meta-analyse data. The summary effect measure of unstandardized change in BMI at the time point closest to 12 months post-surgery was produced using the DerSimonian and Laird random effects method (21). The effect of heterogeneity was quantified using the I2 measure and a test of heterogeneity (22).""

Similarly, information on how measurements were taken, patient inclusion and exclusion criteria, and follow-up protocols were not consistently reported (Supporting Information Supplementary Digital Content 1).""
Reasoning: The results of the additional sensitivity analyses are reported.
[Yes]

P24. Discussion / Summary of evidence
Quotes: ""Bariatric surgery in adolescents results in similar short-term weight outcomes to adults, with RYGB producing the greatest weight loss with the most robust evidence base. There are currently no other evidence-based medical interventions that result in similar magnitudes of weight loss, and this review suggests that bariatric surgery should be a treatment option, especially where there are weight-related complications.""
Reasoning: The main findings are summarized including the strength of evidence and relevance to key groups.
[Yes]

P25. Discussion / Limitations
Quotes: ""As bariatric surgery seems to be associated with a risk of complications and has the potential to impact on different patterns for a lifetime, a balance must be made between the potential benefits and harms at an individual case level. Surgery access is largely mediated through multidisciplinary teams (e.g. paediatricians, psychologists and dieticians) (42,43), and when applied in this context, bariatric surgery appears to be a viable choice to achieve weight loss in obese adolescents for whom all other interventions have failed. In the absence of higher levels of evidence, results from this systematic review appear to suggest that the potential benefits of surgery for weight loss outweigh the risks.""
Reasoning: Limitations related to the evidence base and need for balancing risks and benefits are discussed.
[Yes]

P26. Discussion / Conclusions
Quotes: ""As such, it is difficult to satisfy the condition of equipoise in an RCT when comparing an instantly reversible therapy (lifestyle or pharmacological intervention) with a surgical intervention that has a different risk profile and cost, and would be difficult to remedy or reverse.""
Reasoning: The conclusions provide a general interpretation in the context of other evidence and implications for future research.
[Yes]

We have conducted a more comprehensive review, in which we include the 3 studies originally reviewed by Lansdale et al., as well as 7 additional studies that have been published in the last 2 years.""
Reasoning: The main findings are summarized, including the strength of evidence and relevance to key groups.
[Yes]

P25. Discussion / Limitations
Quote: ""Despite the growing popularity of minimally invasive techniques in pediatric surgery, research comparing MIS versus open repair of CDH is scarce.

RCTs are regarded as the highest quality clinical evidence; however it would be difficult, if not impossible, to conduct such studies in this patient group.""
Reasoning: Limitations at the study and review level are discussed.
[Yes]

P26. Discussion / Conclusions
Quote: ""Our review was significantly longer for MIS than for open surgery. This is consistent with the findings from Lansdale et al. [3], and is likely indicative of the learning curve associated with MIS. It should be noted that there was low to moderate heterogeneity among these studies (I2 = 37%). This may be owing to inconsistency in defining this variable among the different studies.""

Quote: ""This is the largest systematic review and meta-analysis comparing the outcomes of MIS and open surgery for the Bochdalek-type CDH. In 2010, Lansdale et al. [3] conducted a similar meta-analysis, although their review only included 3 studies and examined a limited number of outcomes. Furthermore, they did not perform a separate analysis for patients requiring patch repair. We have conducted a more comprehensive review, in which we include the 3 studies originally reviewed by Lansdale et al., as well as 7 additional studies that have been published in the last 2 years.""
Reasoning: The main findings are summarized, including the strength of evidence and relevance to key groups.
[Yes]

P25. Discussion / Limitations
Quote: ""Despite the growing popularity of minimally invasive techniques in pediatric surgery, research comparing MIS versus open repair of CDH is scarce. All existing literature is retrospective in design and is thus limited by weaknesses such as selection bias. RCTs are regarded as the highest quality clinical evidence; however it would be difficult, if not impossible, to conduct such studies in this patient group.""
Reasoning: Limitations at the study and review level are discussed.
[Yes]

P26. Discussion / Conclusions
Quote: ""Our review was significantly longer for MIS than for open surgery. This is consistent with the findings from Lansdale et al. [3], and is likely indicative of the learning curve associated with MIS. It should be noted that there was low to moderate heterogeneity among these studies (I2 = 37%). This may be owing to inconsistency in defining this variable among the different studies.""

The frequency of follow-up and the form it takes are not further elaborated however.

P24
Quote: ""This review reports the findings from one RCT (50 participants). The intervention focused on laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding surgery, which was compared to a control group receiving a multi component lifestyle program. The study authors were unable to blind their participants, personnel and outcome assessors which may have resulted in a high risk of performance and detection bias. At 24 months follow-up, the mean change in BMI units was 12.7 (95% CI 11.3 to 14.2) in the surgery group compared to 1.3 (95% CI 0.4 to 2.9) in the control group. Adverse events were reported in 12/25 participants in the intervention group compared to 11/25 in the control group.""
Reasoning: The main findings and strength of evidence were summarized.
[Yes]

P25
Quote: ""Our results are limited to two years of follow-up and are based on just one small Australian study with some risk of bias which was conducted in a private hospital, receiving funding from the gastric banding manufacturer. There is currently insufficient evidence to make an informed judgement about efficacy. Whilst an in-house economic evaluation was undertaken with due diligence, it is not viewed as a quick fix to weight loss but should be undertaken with due consideration required for the bespoke needs of an adolescent population.""
Reasoning: Limitations at the study level (risk of bias, insufficient data) and review level (one small study) were discussed.
[Yes]

P26
Quote: ""This systematic review highlights the lack of randomised controlled trials in this field. More high quality studies are required to assess the efficacy of bariatric surgery for the treatment of paediatric obesity and adolescents. The four ongoing studies, once completed, will provide additional evidence on bioenteric intragastric balloon and gastric bypass as alternative procedures in Australian and Swedish adolescents respectively, with two further European studies examining gastric banding. It is important for this research to address clinical effectiveness across a range of populations, including participants ranging in socio-demographics, ethnicity, baseline weight status and geography. Future studies should assess the impact of the surgical procedure and post operative care to minimise adverse events, including the need for post operative adjustments and revisional surgery. Long term follow-up is also critical to comprehensively assess the impact of surgery as participants enter adulthood.""
Reasoning: The authors provided a general interpretation of the results in the context of the evidence base and implications for future research.
[Yes]

P27
Quote: ""We would like to thank Leanne Mohan (Teesside University) and Gudrun Paletta (Cochrane Metabolic and Endocrine Disorders Group) for helping with review management.""
Reasoning: Sources of funding for the systematic review were described, but not the role of the funders.
[No]

In summary, this systematic review met most of the AMSTAR quality criteria, except for not searching for grey literature, providing a list of excluded studies, mentioning the sources of funding for the included study, and assessing publication bias. For PRISMA reporting items, most were adequately addressed, with some exceptions like not presenting the full search strategies, a published protocol, and describing funding sources.","Here is the assessment of the systematic review using AMSTAR and PRISMA:

Quote: ""This review reports the findings from one RCT (50 participants). The intervention focused on laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding surgery, which was compared to a control group receiving a multi component lifestyle program. The study authors were unable to blind their participants, personnel and outcome assessors which may have resulted in a high risk of performance and detection bias. At 24 months follow-up, the mean change in BMI units was 12.7 (95% CI 11.3 to 14.2) in the surgery group compared to 1.3 (95% CI 0.4 to 2.9) in the control group. Adverse events were reported in 12/25 participants in the intervention group compared to 11/25 in the control group.""
Reasoning: The main findings and strength of evidence were summarized.
[Yes]

P25
Quote: ""Our results are limited to two years of follow-up and are based on just one small Australian study with some risk of bias which was conducted in a private hospital, receiving funding from the gastric banding manufacturer. There is currently insufficient evidence to make an informed judgement about efficacy. Whilst an in-house economic evaluation was undertaken with due diligence, it is not viewed as a quick fix to weight loss but should be undertaken with due consideration required for the bespoke needs of an adolescent population.""
Reasoning: Limitations at the study level (risk of bias, insufficient data) and review level (one small study) were discussed.
[Yes]

P26
Quote: ""This systematic review highlights the lack of randomised controlled trials in this field. More high quality studies are required to assess the efficacy of bariatric surgery for the treatment of paediatric obesity and adolescents. The four ongoing studies, once completed, will provide additional evidence on bioenteric intragastric balloon and gastric bypass as alternative procedures in Australian and Swedish adolescents respectively, with two further European studies examining gastric banding. It is important for this research to address clinical effectiveness across a range of populations, including participants ranging in socio-demographics, ethnicity, baseline weight status and geography. Future studies should assess the impact of the surgical procedure and post operative care to minimise adverse events, including the need for post operative adjustments and revisional surgery. Long term follow-up is also critical to comprehensively assess the impact of surgery as participants enter adulthood.""
Reasoning: The authors provided a general interpretation of the results in the context of the evidence base and implications for future research.
[Yes]

P27
Quote: ""We would like to thank Leanne Mohan (Teesside University) and Gudrun Paletta (Cochrane Metabolic and Endocrine Disorders Group) for helping with review management.""

P3. Introduction / Rationale
Quotes: ""Short bowel syndrome (SBS) is a serious disorder in which the intestinal resorptive capacity is insufficient to provide an adequate alimentary supply [1]. The estimated incidence in children is 24.5 per 100,000 live births with a higher incidence reported in preterm infants [2]. The estimated mortality is 2/100,000 population/year for children with SBS under 4 years [2] and 37.5% of neonates with SBS [3]. SBS in children occurs after congenital or acquired loss of part of the intestine [4], in most cases due to gastroschisis, necrotizing enterocolitis, mid-gut volvulus and intestinal atresia [5].""

Quotes: ""The first pivotal aim in the therapy of SBS is to ensure alimentation of the child by parenteral nutrition (PN), which results in significant improvements in mortality rates and improved thrive and quality of life in paediatric SBS [65,66]. Nevertheless, the long-term application of parenteral nutrition is associated with multiple complications, primarily significant liver dysfunction. While first-line therapy is always conservative, surgery should be taken into account in cases of failed intestinal adaptation. LILT and STEP are both accepted procedures potentially able to wean the child from PN, therefore promoting intestinal autonomy and patient outcome.""

Quotes: ""Therefore, LILT and STEP are complementary and supportive to further therapeutic approaches. In comparison with SBTX, both procedures have less associated complications and are independent of the availability of donor organs [67]. The choice for one of both surgical options is essentially driven by feasibility of the procedures and the associated outcome. From the technical perspective STEP has many clear advantages over LILT (Table 4), as during STEP procedure the manipulation and dissection of the mesentery and vasculature are not necessary, which reduces the chance of vascular compromises in comparison with LILT [59]. STEP can be applied to reduce varying degrees of bowel dilatation and may be performed on short and asymmetrical segments of dilated bowel [36,60], which is not feasible with LILT. In intricate intestinal segments, such as the duodenum and adjacent jejunum, only STEP is feasible [34,38].""

P24. Discussion / Summary of evidence
Quotes: ""The present article set out to perform a meta-analysis of the literature regarding esophageal replacement for LGEA or extensive corrosive strictures. The aim of this article was to perform a meta-analysis comparing the most widely used techniques for esophageal replacement in children: jejunal interposition (JI), colon interposition (CI), and gastric pull-up (GPU). Methods Review of the English-language literature published in the past 5 years about esophageal replacement in children was done. The focus was on postoperative survival rate, morbidity (gastrointestinal complications such as anastomotic stenosis/leakage and respiratory complications such as pneumothorax, pneumonia, and atelectasis), and long-term follow-up when available. Among long-term gastrointestinal outcomes were dysphagia, reflux, and dumping; among long-term respiratory outcomes were recurrent pneumonia and recurrent aspiration leading to chronic lung disease.""
Reasoning: The main findings are summarized, including the strength of evidence for key outcomes.
[Yes]

P25. Discussion / Limitations
Quotes: ""Far fewer studies describe the results of GPU and only two authors have illustrated their experience with JI. If all studies about esophageal replacement for LGEA were similar we could compute a simple mean of the effect sizes, but considering the above mentioned methodological heterogeneity a simple comparison of the mean of the event rates described by different investigators seems inadequate. For this reason, we used a random effects model, using a weighted analysis of the most recent studies. Therefore the data depict an estimated overall effect. One should realize that this is only an approximation of reality and that conclusions should be carefully considered. However there are some tendencies that undeniably draw attention.""
Reasoning: Limitations such as the small number of studies on GPU and JI and methodological heterogeneity are discussed.
[Yes]

P26. Discussion / Conclusions
Quotes: ""Importantly, there is little mortality regardless of the type of replacement. In contrast, morbidity is significant. In 470 patients, 93 early respiratory complications and 262 early gastrointestinal complications are reported. Reoperations (e.g., because of graft loss or anastomotic leaks) were necessary in 6% of patients. Reoperation was most prevalent in one of the two JI studies, mainly because of dismal results in this small series (Cauchi et al's). However, the reoperation rate of 6% probably is an underestimation, as anastomotic strictures were mentioned in 74 patients (16% of cases) and one might expect that many of these were dilated, which should be considered a reoperation.""

Quotes: ""The present article set out to perform a meta-analysis of the literature regarding esophageal replacement for LGEA or extensive corrosive strictures. The aim of this article was to perform a meta-analysis comparing the most widely used techniques for esophageal replacement in children: jejunal interposition (JI), colon interposition (CI), and gastric pull-up (GPU). Methods Review of the English-language literature published in the past 5 years about esophageal replacement in children was done. The focus was on postoperative survival rate, morbidity (gastrointestinal complications such as anastomotic stenosis/leakage and respiratory complications such as pneumothorax, pneumonia, and atelectasis), and long-term follow-up when available. Among long-term gastrointestinal outcomes were dysphagia, reflux, and dumping; among long-term respiratory outcomes were recurrent pneumonia and recurrent aspiration leading to chronic lung disease.""
Reasoning: The main findings are summarized, including the strength of evidence for key outcomes.
[Yes]

P25. Discussion / Limitations
Quotes: ""Far fewer studies describe the results of GPU and only two authors have illustrated their experience with JI. If all studies about esophageal replacement for LGEA were similar we could compute a simple mean of the effect sizes, but considering the above mentioned methodological heterogeneity a simple comparison of the mean of the event rates described by different investigators seems inadequate. For this reason, we used a random effects model, using a weighted analysis of the most recent studies. Therefore the data depict an estimated overall effect. One should realize that this is only an approximation of reality and that conclusions should be carefully considered. However there are some tendencies that undeniably draw attention.""
Reasoning: Limitations such as the small number of studies on GPU and JI and methodological heterogeneity are discussed.
[Yes]

P26. Discussion / Conclusions
Quotes: ""Importantly, there is little mortality regardless of the type of replacement. In contrast, morbidity is significant. In 470 patients, 93 early respiratory complications and 262 early gastrointestinal complications are reported. Reoperations (e.g., because of graft loss or anastomotic leaks) were necessary in 6% of patients. Reoperation was most prevalent in one of the two JI studies, mainly because of dismal results in this small series (Cauchi et al's). However, the reoperation rate of 6% probably is an underestimation, as anastomotic strictures were mentioned in 74 patients (16% of cases) and one might expect that many of these were dilated, which should be considered a reoperation.""

P2. Abstract / Structured summary
The abstract is structured with labeled sections including Background, Methods, Results, and Conclusions.
[Yes]

P3. Introduction / Rationale
""Malrotation, also known as intestinal rotation abnormality (IRA), can pose a great risk to the pediatric patient owing to the potential for a catastrophic event such as midgut volvulus, ischemic bowel, and possible short bowel syndrome or death [1]. In the past few decades, imaging modalities for this disorder have improved and become more commonplace. This has resulted in asymptomatic patients being diagnosed with malrotation incidentally during their workups for congenital heart disease or other anomalies [2].""

""We recommend that each major institution evaluates their current approach to patients with asymptomatic malrotation and creates a consistent plan of management that can be studied and revised as needed. Our review would support the following management algorithm: When a patient is diagnosed with malrotation as a result of a screening study, particularly on another study considering should be given to three factors: 1) presence of symptoms, 2) status of cardiac disease, and 3) age. All patients need to undergo an UGI to confirm the diagnosis. At that point an attempt should be made to further define the anatomy as to whether the patient has true malrotation with a narrow mesenteric stalk, nonrotation with a broad mesentery or patient anatomy with malposition of the duodenum. Patients who are symptomatic should undergo a diagnostic laparoscopy and Ladd procedure but in ""normal"" anatomy is confirmed. True malrotation may be considered abnormal. Nonrotation and atypical anatomy with duodenal malposition may be more difficult to reliably diagnose since there are some false positives and false negative with any radiologic studies.""

Quote: ""Extensive mobilization of the spermatic vessels and the vas is one of the advantages of laparoscopy, which is very important for a successful orchiopexy [14, 31]. Conventional inguinal orchidopexy may not achieve adequate length of testicular vessels despite extensive retroperitoneal dissection and division of inferior epigastric vessels [31]. A literature review based on 64 articles containing 8,425 undescended testicles showed unsatisfactory success rates by the open procedure for intra-abdominal testes: 67% for Fowler–Stevens, 77% for staged Fowler–Stevens, 81% for transabdominal, and 84% for intravascular orchidopexy [19]. In contrast, the success rate of laparoscopic orchiopexy (either primary or staged orchopexy) for management of abdominal NPT was reported to be greater than 90% [32–37]. Abolyosr et al. [9] reported a very similar overall success rate between OO and LO in children with peeping testes. It has been believed that compared with OO, LO may have some advantages in children with high intra-abdominal testes, because the conventional open orchidopexy may not achieve an adequate length of testicular vessels [19]. In this meta-analysis, we found no significant difference in the overall success rate and recurrence between the LO and OO groups, and the success rates were well in the range of previous studies [9, 19, 28, 38]. Combined with the fact that the total operative cost was significantly higher when laparoscopy was performed, these results may suggest that the advantages of laparoscopy could be achieved by open surgery, with a favorable cost benefit ratio. However, we noted that earlier studies reported the unnecessary open surgery following diagnostic laparoscopy [5, 10, 12]. Better conclusion can be drawn until a series of RCTs are undertaken to compare the complete LO and OO.""

Quote: ""The undescended testes (cryptorchidism) is one of the most common disorders of childhood, affecting 0.8–1.8% of infants at 1 year of age, 3% of full-term newborns, and 21% of premature babies [1, 2]. Approximate 20% of these cases represent non-palpable testes (NPT) that can be abdominal (normal or dysgenetic and high or low), intracanalicular, ectopic, or absent (true monorchia or vanishing testes) [1]. It has been established that abdominal testes may be associated with an increased risk of infertility and cancer [3, 4].""

Quote: ""In this meta-analysis, we demonstrate that the operative time, time to resume feeding and full activity is similar between LO and OO. Although the hospital stay of LO was slightly shorter than that of OO, this benefit may be less significant due to the one day basis of both procedures in most centers. In addition, the recurrence, success rate and testicular atrophy were found to be comparable between LO and LO, suggesting that laparoscopy does not provide significant advantage over open surgery for treating NPT.""
Reasoning: The authors summarized the main findings and their relevance to key groups.
[Yes]

P25
Quote: ""Another study indicated the longer operative and anesthesia time in laparoscopic cases, due to the natural tendency that peeping testicle is considered as located in the inguinal canal during open procedure and as intra-abdominal under a laparoscope [3]. The overall rate of abdominal testes in 3 large open surgery series is approximately 40%, and there is a higher percent of absent testes in the laparoscopic series [25–27]. However, Ferro et al. [3] reported that the percentage of abdominal testes is same in laparoscopic and open surgical approaches, with a slight difference in the incidence of inguinal and absent testes.""
Reasoning: The authors discussed some limitations at the study and outcome level.
[Yes]

P26
Quote: ""Extensive mobilization of the spermatic vessels and the vas is one of the advantages of laparoscopy, which is very important for a successful orchiopexy [14, 31]. Conventional inguinal orchidopexy may not achieve adequate length of testicular vessels despite extensive retroperitoneal dissection and division of inferior epigastric vessels [31]. A literature review based on 64 articles containing 8,425 undescended testicles showed unsatisfactory success rates by the open procedure for intra-abdominal testes: 67% for Fowler–Stevens, 77% for staged Fowler–Stevens, 81% for transabdominal, and 84% for intravascular orchidopexy [19]. In contrast, the success rate of laparoscopic orchiopexy (either primary or staged orchopexy) for management of abdominal NPT was reported to be greater than 90% [32–37]. Abolyosr et al. [9] reported a very similar overall success rate between OO and LO in children with peeping testes. It has been believed that compared with OO, LO may have some advantages in children with high intra-abdominal testes, because the conventional open orchidopexy may not achieve an adequate length of testicular vessels [19]. In this meta-analysis, we found no significant difference in the overall success rate and recurrence between the LO and OO groups, and the success rates were well in the range of previous studies [9, 19, 28, 38]. Combined with the fact that the total operative cost was significantly higher when laparoscopy was performed, these results may suggest that the advantages of laparoscopy could be achieved by open surgery, with a favorable cost benefit ratio. However, we noted that earlier studies reported the unnecessary open surgery following diagnostic laparoscopy [5, 10, 12]. Better conclusion can be drawn until a series of RCTs are undertaken to compare the complete LO and OO.""
