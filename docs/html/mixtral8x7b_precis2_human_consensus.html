1. Eligibility:
   - <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Patients with type 2 diabetes (n=264) selected by a self-administered questionnaire aimed at measuring emotional distress and diabetes-related reduced daily functioning.&quot;</span> [Page 2]
   - <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Patients with score DFT >4 and DS >3 were eligible for trial participation.&quot;</span> [Page 3]
   - <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The time interval between the researcher-driven self-administered screening questionnaire and the face-to-face nurse-led detection procedure in the consultation room needed to be as short as possible.&quot;</span> [Page 3]

2. The eligibility criteria for the trial are based on a self-administered questionnaire that measures emotional distress and diabetes-related reduced daily functioning. The trial participants were selected based on a cut-off score for the Daily Functioning Thermometer (DFT) and the Distress Screener (DS). The researcher-driven screening questionnaire and the face-to-face nurse-led detection procedure in the consultation room needed to be as close as possible to ensure the accuracy of the detection. This approach is more pragmatic than explanatory, as it aims to reflect the usual care setting where patients are screened for eligibility based on their symptoms and medical history. However, the use of a researcher-driven screening questionnaire and a face-to-face nurse-led detection procedure may introduce some level of bias and variability in the selection process.

   Score: [4]

3. Recruitment:
   - <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The enclosed self-administered questionnaire consisted of the screening instruments that intervention PNs would also apply for SMS in their routine practice.&quot;</span> [Page 2]
   - <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Patients were asked to return the completed questionnaire to the research centre and to give informed consent to be approached if they were found to be eligible for research follow-up measurements.&quot;</span> [Page 3]
   - <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Within a week after receiving the screening questionnaire at our research centre, eligible patients were sent an invitation letter together with an informed consent form for trial participation and the baseline measurement.&quot;</span> [Page 3]

4. The recruitment process for the trial involves sending a self-administered questionnaire to patients, which includes the same screening instruments used by the intervention PNs in their routine practice. Patients are asked to return the completed questionnaire to the research center, and eligible patients are sent an invitation letter with an informed consent form for trial participation and the baseline measurement. This approach is more pragmatic than explanatory, as it aims to reflect the usual care setting where patients are recruited based on their symptoms and medical history. However, the use of a researcher-driven recruitment process may introduce some level of bias and variability in the selection process.

6. The study was conducted in a regional organization of GPs in the South of the Netherlands, involving practice nurses providing care to approximately 4000 patients with diabetes. The study was conducted between November 2011 and February 2013 and was registered in a Dutch public trial registry. This approach is more pragmatic than explanatory, as it aims to reflect the usual care setting where patients receive care from practice nurses in a regional organization of GPs. However, the specific setting may limit the generalizability of the results to other regions or healthcare systems.

7. The organization of the trial involves training practice nurses in the intervention arm to integrate the detection and follow-up phase of SMS into their daily practice. The PNs were blinded regarding the outcomes of the recruitment procedure and study participation of their patients. Financial reimbursement was added to the bundled payment arrangement for diabetes care. This approach is more pragmatic than explanatory, as it aims to reflect the usual care setting where patients receive care from practice nurses who are trained and compensated for providing SMS. However, the specific organization may limit the generalizability of the results to other healthcare systems or settings.

8. The flexibility in the delivery of the intervention involves detecting patients with emotional distress and reduced daily functioning and supporting them through problem-solving and reattribution techniques. The intervention strategy is derived from the principles of learning theory, and PNs supported patients in defining problems and finding solutions themselves. This approach is more pragmatic than explanatory, as it aims to reflect the usual care setting where patients receive care from practice nurses who use problem-solving and reattribution techniques to support patients with emotional distress and reduced daily functioning. However, the specific delivery may limit the generalizability of the results to other healthcare systems or settings.

9. The flexibility in adherence to the intervention is not applicable in some trials, such as surgical trials or Intensive Care Unit trials, as there is no compliance issue after consent has been given. In this trial, patients could use information from a diary to record symptoms, thoughts, worries, feelings, and behavior. Both problem-solving and reattribution techniques were intended to result in action plans indicating how patients would achieve their personal goals. This approach is more pragmatic than explanatory, as it aims to reflect the usual care setting where patients receive care from practice nurses who use problem-solving and reattribution techniques to support patients with emotional distress and reduced daily functioning. However, the specific adherence may limit the generalizability of the results to other healthcare systems or settings.

In the year following the training, PNs in the intervention arm recorded process measures and outcomes of SMS on a specific registration form. These data were used to evaluate whether patients were exposed to SMS. This approach is more pragmatic than explanatory, as it aims to reflect the usual care setting where patients receive care from practice nurses who record process measures and outcomes of SMS on a specific registration form. However, the specific follow-up may limit the generalizability of the results to other healthcare systems or settings.

<p><i><span style="border-bottom: 1px dashed black;">9 quote(s) from
publication full text</span> (mean similarity 100%)</i></p>
<pre>
1. Eligibility:

Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Patients who perceive their medication to be ineffective or inconvenient are less likely to be adherent to treatment, with potentially significant consequences on long-term clinical outcomes. Many patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) are nonadherent to treatment despite demonstrated efficacy of disease-modifying therapies (DMTs).&quot;</span>

Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The efficacy of glatiramer acetate (GA; Copaxone®, Teva Pharmaceuticals) both 20 mg/mL once daily (GA20) and 40 mg/mL three times weekly (GA40) has been well established (Khan et al., 2013), and GA40 has demonstrated a better tolerability profile than GA20 (Wolinsky et al., 2015).&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The full text describes a clinical trial comparing the efficacy and tolerability of two doses of glatiramer acetate (GA20 and GA40) in patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS). The inclusion and exclusion criteria are not explicitly stated in the text, but it is mentioned that patients with a progressive form of MS or neuromyelitis optica were excluded. The text also mentions that patients with previous exposure to GA40 were excluded, but patients with previous exposure to GA20 were included. The text does not provide information on the similarity of the trial participants to those who would receive this intervention if it was part of usual care. Therefore, it is difficult to assess the pragmatism of the eligibility criteria.

Score: [NA]

2. Recruitment:

Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The CONFIDENCE study was a multinational, multicenter, randomized, parallel-group, phase 4, open-label study conducted at 88 study centers in 14 countries (Russia, Poland, Italy, France, Croatia, US [including Puerto Rico], Mexico, Spain, Austria, Turkey, Belgium, Argentina, Germany, and Finland) across different geographic regions.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The full text describes a multinational, multicenter, randomized, parallel-group, phase 4, open-label study conducted at 88 study centers in 14 countries. The text does not provide information on the recruitment methods or the extra effort made to recruit participants over and above what would be used in the usual care setting. Therefore, it is difficult to assess the pragmatism of the recruitment process.

Score: [NA]

3. Setting:

Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Patients in the study received treatment for 6 months, and the study was conducted during a period starting in August 2015 and ending in January 2017.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The full text describes a clinical trial in which patients received treatment for 6 months, but it does not provide information on the setting of the trial or the usual care setting. Therefore, it is difficult to assess the pragmatism of the setting.

Score: [NA]

4. Organization:

Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The CONFIDENCE study was a multinational, multicenter, randomized, parallel-group, phase 4, open-label study conducted at 88 study centers in 14 countries (Russia, Poland, Italy, France, Croatia, US [including Puerto Rico], Mexico, Spain, Austria, Turkey, Belgium, Argentina, Germany, and Finland) across different geographic regions.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The full text describes a multinational, multicenter, randomized, parallel-group, phase 4, open-label study conducted at 88 study centers in 14 countries. The text does not provide information on the resources, provider expertise, and organization of care delivery in the intervention arm of the trial or those available in usual care. Therefore, it is difficult to assess the pragmatism of the organization.

Score: [NA]

5. Flexibility (delivery):

Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;In the present study, an open-label design was necessary, because the difference in frequency of administration between the GA20 and GA40 formulations is at the heart of the study, meaning that a double-blind design was not feasible, nor was the use of a double-dummy approach that would equalize the frequency of drug administration suitable for a clinical trial designed to compare, among other things, patient perceptions of treatment convenience.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The full text describes a clinical trial comparing the efficacy and tolerability of two doses of glatiramer acetate (GA20 and GA40) in patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS). The text mentions that an open-label design was necessary because of the difference in frequency of administration between the GA20 and GA40 formulations. The text does not provide information on the flexibility in how the intervention is delivered or the flexibility likely in usual care. Therefore, it is difficult to assess the pragmatism of the flexibility in delivery.

Score: [NA]

6. Flexibility (adherence):

Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Adherence to treatment when the dosing schedule differs is complicated, because missing one dose has potentially differential impacts on treatment. Thus, adherence was measured using the self-reported MS-TAQ.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The full text describes a clinical trial comparing the efficacy and tolerability of two doses of glatiramer acetate (GA20 and GA40) in patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS). The text mentions that adherence was measured using the self-reported MS-TAQ, but it does not provide information on the flexibility in how participants must adhere to the intervention or the flexibility likely in usual care. Therefore, it is difficult to assess the pragmatism of the flexibility in adherence.

Score: [NA]

7. Follow-up:

Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Safety assessments were recorded in clinic visits and included adverse events (AEs) throughout the study, vital sign measurements, concomitant medication usage, and clinical laboratory test results at screening and Months 1, 3, and 6.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The full text describes a clinical trial in which safety assessments were recorded in clinic visits and included adverse events (AEs), vital sign measurements, concomitant medication usage, and clinical laboratory test results at screening and Months 1, 3, and 6. The text does not provide information on the intensity of measurement and follow-up of participants in the trial or the likely follow-up in usual care. Therefore, it is difficult to assess the pragmatism of the follow-up.

Score: [NA]

8. Primary outcome:

Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The primary endpoint was patient overall satisfaction with the medication as measured by the single-item MSQ 7-point scale (1 = extremely dissatisfied to 7 = extremely satisfied).&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The full text describes a clinical trial in which the primary endpoint was patient overall satisfaction with the medication as measured by the single-item MSQ 7-point scale (1 = extremely dissatisfied to 7 = extremely satisfied). The text does not provide information on the relevance of the trial's primary outcome to participants or the use of a surrogate, physiological outcome, central adjudication, or assessment expertise that is not available in usual care. Therefore, it is difficult to assess the pragmatism of the primary outcome.

Score: [NA]

9. Primary analysis:

Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Patient-reported endpoints were analyzed based on the full analysis set (FAS), which included all patients in the ITT population who received at least 1 dose of study drug and had at least 1 post-baseline assessment. Safety analyses were performed on the safety analysis set, which included all patients who received at least 1 dose of a study drug.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The full text describes a clinical trial in which patient-reported endpoints were analyzed based on the full analysis set (FAS), which included all patients in the ITT population who received at least 1 dose of study drug and had at least 1 post-baseline assessment. Safety analyses were performed on the safety analysis set, which included all patients who received at least 1 dose of a study drug. The text does not provide information on the inclusion of all data in the analysis of the primary outcome or the exclusion of ineligible post-randomization participants, completers, or those following the treatment protocol. Therefore, it is difficult to assess the pragmatism of the primary analysis.

<pre>
1. Eligibility:
   - <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;People had to be aged 18 years or more, have a confirmed diagnosis of relapsing–remitting MS, have an Ambulation Index score of 2, 3 or 4 (mild to moderate walking disabilities), and have received medical clearance to participate.&quot;</span> [Page 2]
   - <span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 99.7%):

Volunteers were excluded if they had an acute exacerbation of MS within 2 months of starting the program, had benign or progressive/relapsing types of MS, had a serious unstable medical condition, had any concurrent condition, for example stroke, or had participated in a PRT program in the 6 months before training started.' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;Volunteers were excluded if they had an acute exacerbation of MS within 2 months of starting the program, had benign or progres-sive/relapsing types of MS, had a serious unstable medical condition, had any concurrent condition, for example stroke, or had participated in a PRT program in the 6 months before training started.&quot;</span> [Page 2]

   The inclusion and exclusion criteria for this trial are quite extensive, but they do not seem to be overly restrictive. The Ambulation Index score is used to ensure that participants have mild to moderate walking disabilities, and medical clearance is required to ensure participants are able to safely participate in the trial. Exclusion criteria include acute exacerbation of MS, benign or progres-sive/relapsing types of MS, serious unstable medical conditions, concurrent conditions, and participation in a PRT program in the 6 months before training started. These criteria are similar to those that would be used in a usual care setting, making the eligibility criteria pragmatic.

   Score: [5]

2. Recruitment:
   - <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Recruitment information flyers were sent by mail to all potential participants registered on the mailing lists of both organizations. If interested, volunteers were asked to contact one of the researchers (KD) by telephone, during which volunteers were screened to ensure they satisfied the inclusion criteria.&quot;</span> [Page 2]

   Recruitment for this trial was conducted through a statewide organization providing education and support to people with MS, and a large specialist MS outpatient clinic. Recruitment information flyers were sent by mail to all potential participants registered on the mailing lists of both organizations. This method of recruitment is similar to how participants might be recruited in a usual care setting, making the recruitment process pragmatic.

   Score: [5]

3. Setting:
   - <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The experimental group completed a 10-week (two times per week), PRT program in one of four community gymnasiums in metropolitan and regional areas.&quot;</span> [Page 3]

   The setting for the experimental group was in community gymnasiums, which is similar to where participants might receive this intervention in a usual care setting. The control group received usual care plus a social program, which could also be conducted in a community setting.

   Score: [5]

4. Organization:
   - <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Each exercise session was completed in around 45 min, and at the end of each session there was a 30-min recovery period when the participants had refreshments and time to socialize.&quot;</span> [Page 3]

   The organization of the intervention in this trial is similar to how it might be organized in a usual care setting. Each exercise session was completed in around 45 minutes, and at the end of each session there was a 30-min recovery period when the participants had refreshments and time to socialize. This is similar to how an exercise program might be organized in a usual care setting.

   Score: [5]

5. Flexibility (delivery):
   - <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;All exercises were completed on weight machines. The training intensity was based on recommendations of the American College of Sports Medicine (2009) and consisted of two sets of 10–12 repetitions of each exercise, at a training intensity of 10–12 repetition maximum (that is, only 12 consecutive repetitions of each exercise could be completed before muscle fatigue was reached). The weight lifted was increased when two sets of 12 repetitions of an exercise could be completed. Two-minute rest periods were given between each exercise set.&quot;</span> [Page 3]

   The flexibility in how the intervention was delivered in this trial is similar to how it might be delivered in a usual care setting. The exercises were completed on weight machines, and the training intensity was based on recommendations of the American College of Sports Medicine. Two sets of 10--12 repetitions of each exercise were completed at a training intensity of 10--12 repetition maximum. The weight lifted was increased when two sets of 12 repetitions of an exercise could be completed, and two-minute rest periods were given between each exercise set. This is similar to how an exercise program might be delivered in a usual care setting.

   Score: [5]

6. Flexibility (adherence):
   - <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants were asked to return to their usual activities and not to continue or commence resistance training until after the follow-up assessment session.&quot;</span> [Page 4]

   The flexibility in how participants must adhere to the intervention in this trial is similar to how it might be in a usual care setting. Participants were asked to return to their usual activities and not to continue or commence resistance training until after the follow-up assessment session. This is similar to how an exercise program might be delivered in a usual care setting.

   Score: [5]

7. Follow-up:
   - <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Outcome measurements were taken three times: at baseline, after 10 weeks to determine the immediate effects of the intervention, and after a further 12 weeks (week 22) to determine if any benefits from the program had been sustained.&quot;</span> [Page 4]

   The intensity of measurement and follow-up of participants in the trial is similar to how it might be in a usual care setting. Outcome measurements were taken three times: at baseline, after 10 weeks to determine the immediate effects of the intervention, and after a further 12 weeks (week 22) to determine if any benefits from the program had been sustained. This is similar to how an exercise program might be delivered in a usual care setting.

   Score: [5]

8. Primary outcome:
   - <span title='Moderate quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 94.4%):

the primary aim of this randomized controlled trial was to examine the immediate effects of a supervised PRT program on walking function in people with relapsing–remitting MS who had difficulty walking.' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ff9e81'>&quot;The trial's primary outcome was to examine the immediate effects of a supervised PRT program on walking function in people with relapsing–remitting MS who had difficulty walking.&quot;</span> [Page 2]

   The primary outcome of the trial is relevant to participants, as it focuses on improving the gait deficits common in this population. This is similar to how the primary outcome might be in a usual care setting.

9. Primary analysis:
   - <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;To determine if any improvements were maintained 12 weeks after a complete break from training. It was hypothesized that compared with a control group, people with MS who participated in PRT would: 1. walk further over 2 min, and their maximum walking speed over 10 m would be faster.&quot;</span> [Page 2]

   The primary analysis of the trial is focused on determining if any improvements were maintained 12 weeks after a complete break from training. This is similar to how the primary analysis might be in a usual care setting.

1. Eligibility:
   - <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Adults with MS were included based on the ability to walk 5 km without rest or use of assistive device.&quot;</span> [Page 3]
   - <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Exclusion criteria were reports to have run 5 km in the preceding 6 months or a relapse occurring in the preceding 3 months.&quot;</span> [Page 3]

2. The eligibility criteria in this study are relatively pragmatic, as they only exclude those who have run 5 km in the preceding 6 months or have had a relapse in the preceding 3 months. The primary inclusion criterion is the ability to walk 5 km without rest or use of assistive device, which is similar to usual care. The study also includes a waitlist control group, which further increases the pragmatism of the eligibility criteria. Score: [4]

1. Eligibility:

   Quote 1: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants were recruited through eight health care organisations, including the UK National Health Service (NHS) Trusts, social enterprises, and third sector multiple sclerosis therapy centres, in two regions (Devon–Cornwall and East Anglia) of the UK. Individuals were invited consecutively until the allocated number of standing frames (dependent on commissioning costs) at each health care organisation had been reached.&quot;</span>

   Quote 2: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Key inclusion criteria were age older than 18 years, a diagnosis of progressive multiple sclerosis (primary or secondary) according to McDonald’s criteria, and a score of 6·5–8·0 on the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS).&quot;</span>

   Quote 3: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Key exclusion criteria were being within 3 months of ceasing a multiple sclerosis disease modifying drug, receiving steroid treatment within the preceding month, or participating in another clinical trial.&quot;</span>

   Reasoning: The inclusion and exclusion criteria are relatively broad and similar to those used in usual care, indicating a pragmatic approach. However, the recruitment process is limited to specific regions and health care organisations, which may limit generalisability.

   Quote 1: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants were recruited through eight health care organisations, including the UK National Health Service (NHS) Trusts, social enterprises, and third sector multiple sclerosis therapy centres, in two regions (Devon–Cornwall and East Anglia) of the UK.&quot;</span>

   Reasoning: The study is conducted in multiple health care organisations in two regions of the UK, which is similar to the usual care setting. However, the study does not explicitly state whether the intervention is delivered in the same setting as usual care. The score for this domain is <span style='background-color: #ff9e81' title='Added score prefix during extraction'>Score: [3]</span>.

4. Organisation:

   Quote 1: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;All participants received their usual health and social service input throughout the study period.&quot;</span>

   Reasoning: The study does not explicitly state whether the resources, provider expertise, and organisation of care delivery in the intervention arm are different from those available in usual care. However, the fact that participants received their usual health and social service input throughout the study period suggests that the organisation of care delivery is similar to usual care.

<pre>
1. Eligibility:
   - <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants were randomised in groups of eight to physiotherapist (PT)-led exercise (n = 80), yoga (n = 77), fitness instructor (FI)-led exercise (n = 86) and they took part in weekly community-based group exercise sessions. Those in the control group were asked not to change of their exercise habits (n = 71).&quot;</span>
   - <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Eligible participants were over 18 years of age and had a diagnosis of MS that was confirmed by a consultant physician or neurologist.&quot;</span>
   - <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Persons with MS were excluded if they had a previous relapse or began steroid therapy in the 12 weeks prior to participating in the first assessment, were pregnant, or had a comorbidity that severely impacted their ability to safely participate in exercise.&quot;</span>
2. The eligibility criteria for this trial are relatively pragmatic, as they allow for a wide range of participants with MS to be included, as long as they meet the basic age, diagnosis, and exclusion criteria. The inclusion of participants with minimal gait impairment, as well as those with different types of MS, increases the generalizability of the trial's findings. However, the exclusion of participants with a recent relapse or steroid therapy, as well as those with severe comorbidities, may limit the trial's applicability to more complex cases of MS. Overall, the eligibility criteria for this trial are moderately pragmatic, with some room for improvement in terms of inclusivity. Score: [4]
3. Recruitment:
   - <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants were referred to the project by themselves, their care-giver, MSI, chartered physiotherapists, neurologists, general practitioners or clinical nurse specialists.&quot;</span>
   - <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The study was approved by each ethics committee in the 10 regions of Ireland where the study took place. Written informed consent was obtained from each participant.&quot;</span>
4. The recruitment process for this trial is relatively pragmatic, as it allows for participants to be referred from a variety of sources, including themselves, their caregivers, and healthcare professionals. The use of multiple ethics committees and written informed consent also adds to the trial's credibility and transparency. However, the lack of information on the specific methods used to recruit participants, such as advertising or outreach, makes it difficult to fully assess the pragmatism of the recruitment process. Overall, the recruitment process for this trial is moderately pragmatic, with some room for improvement in terms of transparency and inclusivity. Score: [3]
5. Setting:
   - <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;All interventions took place in groups of eight, for an hour per week, for 10 weeks.&quot;</span>
   - <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;They were delivered in community centres such as local gyms, hotels and health centres.&quot;</span>
6. The setting of this trial is relatively pragmatic, as it takes place in community centers, which are widely available and accessible to most people. The use of groups of eight participants also adds to the trial's pragmatism, as it allows for a more realistic and naturalistic intervention setting. However, the lack of information on the specific community centers used, as well as any potential barriers or challenges faced by participants in accessing these centers, makes it difficult to fully assess the pragmatism of the trial's setting. Overall, the setting of this trial is moderately pragmatic, with some room for improvement in terms of transparency and inclusivity. Score: [4]
7. Organization:
   - <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The PT-led exercise provided was pre-defined. It consisted of a circuit-style class of exercises that were either resisted by body weight or by the addition of free weights.&quot;</span>
   - <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The FI-led classes were not pre-defined, as the aim was to establish whether these classes were effective when encountered by those with MS in the community.&quot;</span>
   - <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The yoga intervention was also not predefined, and detailed descriptions of the classes were gathered by nine of the instructors.&quot;</span>
8. The organization of this trial is relatively pragmatic, as it allows for a range of intervention types, including pre-defined PT-led exercise, non-predefined FI-led classes, and non-predefined yoga classes. The use of different intervention types also adds to the trial's generalizability and applicability to real-world settings. However, the lack of information on the specific resources and expertise required for each intervention type, as well as any potential challenges faced by instructors in delivering these interventions, makes it difficult to fully assess the pragmatism of the trial's organization. Overall, the organization of this trial is moderately pragmatic, with some room for improvement in terms of transparency and inclusivity. Score: [3]
9. Flexibility (delivery):
   - <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;In addition to the once-weekly class, participants were advised to exercise aerobically in the mode of their choice (walking, cycling, swimming or running), with the aim of exercising for 30 minutes, twice a week, at an intensity of 65% of the heart rate max, or a Borg’s rate of perceived exertion of 11–14.&quot;</span>
   - <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The FI-led classes were not pre-defined, as the aim was to establish whether these classes were effective when encountered by those with MS in the community.&quot;</span>

10. The flexibility of this trial in terms of delivery is relatively pragmatic, as it allows for a range of intervention types, including pre-defined PT-led exercise, non-predefined FI-led classes, and non-predefined yoga classes. The use of different intervention types also adds to the trial's generalizability and applicability to real-world settings. However, the lack of information on the specific flexibility allowed in each intervention type, as well as any potential challenges faced by instructors in delivering these interventions, makes it difficult to fully assess the pragmatism of the trial's flexibility in delivery. Overall, the flexibility of this trial in terms of delivery is moderately pragmatic, with some room for improvement in terms of transparency and inclusivity. Score: [3]
11. Flexibility (adherence):
    - <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;In addition to the once-weekly class, participants were advised to exercise aerobically in the mode of their choice (walking, cycling, swimming or running), with the aim of exercising for 30 minutes, twice a week, at an intensity of 65% of the heart rate max, or a Borg’s rate of perceived exertion of 11–14.&quot;</span>

12. The flexibility of this trial in terms of adherence is relatively pragmatic, as it allows for participants to choose their own mode of aerobic exercise, as well as the frequency and intensity of their exercise. The use of different intervention types also adds to the trial's generalizability and applicability to real-world settings. However, the lack of information on the specific flexibility allowed in each intervention type, as well as any potential challenges faced by participants in adhering to these interventions, makes it difficult to fully assess the pragmatism of the trial's flexibility in adherence. Overall, the flexibility of this trial in terms of adherence is moderately pragmatic, with some room for improvement in terms of transparency and inclusivity. Score: [3]
13. Follow-up:
    - <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Trained assessors tested the participants in week 1, participants exercised during weeks 2–11 and then were assessed again at week 12.&quot;</span>
    - <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Outcome was assessed at week 24 for the intervention groups only, as it was felt that withholding a potentially beneficial treatment for longer than 12 weeks, from the controls, could be considered unethical.&quot;</span>
14. The follow-up process for this trial is relatively pragmatic, as it allows for participants to be assessed at multiple time points, including at the beginning, during, and after the intervention period. The use of trained assessors also adds to the trial's credibility and transparency. However, the lack of information on the specific methods used to assess participants, as well as any potential challenges faced by assessors in collecting and analyzing data, makes it difficult to fully assess the pragmatism of the trial's follow-up process. Overall, the follow-up process for this trial is moderately pragmatic, with some room for improvement in terms of transparency and inclusivity. Score: [3]
15. Primary outcome:
    - <span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 99.5%):

The primary outcome measure was the physical component of the Multiple Sclerosis Impact Scale29, version 2 (MSIS-29v2), a patient-reported outcome measure that assesses the physical impact of MS.' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;The primary outcome measure was the physical component of the Multiple Sclerosis Impact Scale-29, version 2 (MSIS-29v2), a patient-reported outcome measure that assesses the physical impact of MS.&quot;</span>
    - <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Other measures were the MSIS-29v2’s psychological component, the Modified Fatigue Impact Scale (MFIS) and the Six-Minute Walk Test (6MWT).&quot;</span>
16. The primary outcome for this trial is relatively pragmatic, as it focuses on a patient-reported outcome measure that assesses the physical impact of MS. The use of additional measures, such as the psychological component of the MSIS-29v2 and the MFIS, also adds to the trial's comprehensiveness and applicability to real-world settings. However, the lack of information on the specific methods used to assess these outcomes, as well as any potential challenges faced by assessors in collecting and analyzing data, makes it difficult to fully assess the pragmatism of the trial's primary outcome. Overall, the primary outcome for this trial is moderately pragmatic, with some room for improvement in terms of transparency and inclusivity. Score: [3]
17. Primary analysis:
    - <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;All statistical analyses were conducted using Predictive Analytics Software (PASW) Statistics 17.&quot;</span>
    - <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Repeated Measures ANOVA was conducted for the MSIS-29v2 physical subscale and the MFIS.&quot;</span>
    - <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Although repeated measures ANOVA is the preferred method to analyse RCTs with pre and post data for four groups, the p-values for the normality tests were < 0.05 and the histograms revealed skewed data, thus assumptions for parametric testing were not met for the MSIS-29, v2 psychological component or the 6MWT.&quot;</span>
18. The primary analysis for this trial is relatively pragmatic, as it uses a range of statistical methods to analyze the data, including repeated measures ANOVA and non-parametric tests. The use of different statistical methods also adds to the trial's credibility and transparency. However, the lack of information on the specific methods used to analyze the data, as well as any potential challenges faced by analysts in interpreting and reporting the results, makes it difficult to fully assess the pragmatism of the trial's primary analysis.

2. The eligibility criteria in this trial are similar to those used in usual care, as the trial focuses on patients with RRMS who have had an inadequate response to prior disease-modifying therapies. The inclusion criteria are not overly restrictive, and the trial does not use any selection tests not used in usual care. Therefore, the eligibility criteria in this trial are pragmatic.

   Score: [5]

3. Recruitment:
   - <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Blinded raters performed EDSS assessments at baseline, every 3 months, and when relapse was suspected.&quot;</span> [Page 1986]
   - <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Patients were also assessed using the 4-component, MSFC plus SLCLA score incorporating Z scores from binocular, 1.25% contrast test-&quot;</span> [Page 1987]

4. The recruitment process in this trial is similar to that used in usual care, as the trial uses blinded raters to perform EDSS assessments and assesses patients using the 4-component, MSFC plus SLCLA score. The trial does not make any extra effort to recruit participants beyond what would be used in usual care.

   Score: [5]

1. Eligibility:
   - <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;A total of 150 patients were randomly assigned to the intervention (n  76) or to UC (n  74).&quot;</span>
   - <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Excluded were patients with reported or medically recorded diagnoses of current serious psychological disorders other than depression and anxiety syndromes, evidence of dementia as indicated by testing below the fifth percentile in at least 3 of 6 dimensions of neuropsychological functioning (i.e., attention and concentration, processing speed, executive function, verbal memory, and verbal processing), other currently life-threatening or severely disabling physical disorders, current MS exacerbation, symptomatic MS medication altered in the last 3 months, other disorders of the CNS, pregnancy, or inability to speak or read German.&quot;</span>
   - <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The study was conducted from February 2007 to March 2009.&quot;</span>

2. Reasoning:
   The trial included patients with relapsing-remitting or secondary progressive MS, with an EDSS score of 6 and a 1 step increase within the last year. Patients were excluded if they had current serious psychological disorders other than depression and anxiety syndromes, evidence of dementia, other currently life-threatening or severely disabling physical disorders, current MS exacerbation, symptomatic MS medication altered in the last 3 months, other disorders of the CNS, pregnancy, or inability to speak or read German. The trial was conducted from February 2007 to March 2009.
   This suggests that the eligibility criteria were similar to those who would receive this intervention if it was part of usual care, with some exclusion criteria that are not typically part of usual care.

1. Recruitment:
   - <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;A total of 164 patients self-referred to the study. Eleven were excluded and 3 declined to participate (figure 1). The remaining 150 patients were randomized.&quot;</span>
   - <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The study was approved by the Ethics Commission of Both Basels and is registered at www.controlled-trials.com, ISRCTN21643919. All participants completed written informed consent.&quot;</span>

2. Reasoning:
   The trial recruited patients through the outpatient neurology clinic of the University Hospital Basel, other physicians, or advertisements posted in the Swiss Multiple Sclerosis Society Bulletin. The trial was approved by the Ethics Commission of Both Basels and all participants completed written informed consent.
   This suggests that the recruitment process was similar to that used in usual care, with some additional effort made to recruit participants through advertisements.

1. Organization:
   - <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;MBI closely followed the program of mindfulness-based stress reduction and included 1) a personal intake interview to define realistic goals of participants and establish personal rapport; 2) 8 weekly 2.5-hour classes in mindfulness practices (10 –15 participants/group; exercises did not exceed patients’ level of functioning); 3) one Saturday, 7-hour session at week 6; 4) homework assignments (approximately 40 minutes/day), emphasized as essential to success of the program; 5) a postintervention interview to evaluate personal experiences, goal attainment, and future maintenance of acquired skills. Each class covered specific exercises and topics within the context of mindfulness training, i.e., practices during lying, sitting, and dynamic yoga postures, as well as during everyday life, e.g., stressful situations and social interactions. Mindfulness exercises included observation of sensory, affective, and cognitive domains of perceptible experience. The all-day retreat integrated familiar exercises and presented new ones.&quot;</span>

In summary, the PRECIS-2 scores for the trial are as follows:

* Eligibility: [4]
* Recruitment: [3]
* Setting: [5]
* Organization: [1]
* Flexibility (delivery): [5]
* Flexibility (adherence): [5]
* Follow-up: [5]
* Primary outcome: [5]
* Primary analysis: [5]

These scores suggest that the trial was generally pragmatic, with some aspects that were more explanatory. The trial was conducted in a hospital setting, with a structured 8-week program of mindfulness training, and included all data in the analysis of the primary outcome. The trial was pragmatic in terms of eligibility, follow-up, primary outcome, and primary analysis, but was more explanatory in terms of organization and flexibility (adherence). The trial was also slightly more explanatory in terms of recruitment and flexibility (delivery), as some additional effort was made to recruit participants through advertisements and the intervention was delivered in a structured 8-week program.</pre>

   - <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;during the training month subjects improved on the individual H-caD exercises but, as in the usual care group, the arm/hand function remained at the same level.&quot;</span>
   - <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;besides clinical effectiveness, the user satisfaction of the H-caD system has been investigated using VaS scales.&quot;</span>

12. The flexibility of the intervention adherence is pragmatic, as it involves measuring the user satisfaction of the H-caD system using VaS scales. The fact that the arm/hand function remained at the same level during the training month suggests that the intervention was not able to improve the primary outcome, which is a common and necessary approach in clinical trials. Score: [5]

13. Follow-up:
   - <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;the third measurement (t2) was performed after the month of H-caD intervention for the intervention group and 2 months after baseline for the control group.&quot;</span>

14. The follow-up process for this trial is pragmatic, as it involves measuring the outcomes at multiple time points and including a follow-up measurement for the intervention group. Score: [5]

15. Primary outcome:
   - <span title='Moderate quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 93%):

   - <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;the ara test was chosen as the main outcome measure because all the patients were able to perform the total test compared to the WMFt test where the patient has to stand up for some exercises - impossible for wheelchair bound patients.&quot;</span>

16. The primary outcome for this trial is pragmatic, as it involves measuring the arm/hand function using the ara test and the NHPt. The ara test was chosen as the main outcome measure because it is more feasible for wheelchair-bound patients, which is a common and necessary approach in clinical trials. Score: [5]

17. Primary analysis:

2. The eligibility criteria in this trial are relatively pragmatic, as they aim to include patients with palliative care needs who are severely affected by MS. The inclusion criteria are broad and based on clinical judgment, while the exclusion criteria are minimal. The trial does not seem to use any specific selection tests or strict exclusion criteria, which is consistent with a pragmatic approach. However, the fact that patients were referred by clinicians might introduce some selection bias, which could make the trial less pragmatic. Overall, the eligibility criteria seem to be relatively pragmatic, but not entirely free from explanatory elements.

3. Recruitment:
   - <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;After baseline interview, patients were randomly allocated to either a multiprofessional palliative care team (PCT) immediately (fast track) or the control care group who continued best usual care for three months and then were offered the PCT.&quot;</span>

4. The recruitment process in this trial is relatively pragmatic, as patients were randomly allocated to either the intervention or control group after a baseline interview. The fact that patients were not blinded to their group allocation might introduce some bias, but this is a common limitation in many trials. The reasons for dropout and refusal were recorded, which is a good practice that increases the transparency and generalizability of the trial. However, the fact that patients were recruited by clinicians might introduce some selection bias, which could make the trial less pragmatic. Overall, the recruitment process seems to be relatively pragmatic, but not entirely free from explanatory elements.

5. Setting:
   - <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;After consent and baseline interview, the researcher e-mailed relevant data to independent statisticians who conducted the randomization using the minimization method to give an equal balance of gender, age, date of diagnosis, and according to whether patients could or could not communicate.&quot;</span>

6. The setting of this trial is relatively pragmatic, as patients were randomized to receive either the intervention or control group in their usual care setting. The fact that the trial used a minimization method to balance the groups is a good practice that increases the internal validity of the trial. However, the fact that patients were not blinded to their group allocation might introduce some bias, which could make the trial less pragmatic. Overall, the setting seems to be relatively pragmatic, but not entirely free from explanatory elements.

12. The flexibility in how participants must adhere to the intervention in this trial is not applicable, as there is no compliance issue after consent has been given. This is consistent with a pragmatic approach, as the trial does not impose any unnecessary restrictions on participants' adherence to the intervention.

9. The full text provides limited information about the flexibility of the CDT adherence. The MS diagnosis was not confirmed by a neurologist, and the EDSS score was checked by assessing whether the patient was self-sufficient and able to walk ≤500 meters without aid or rest. However, the EDSS score was further quantified on-site by an experienced neurologist, prior to the start of CDT, in patients randomized to the intervention. The flexibility of the CDT adherence seems to be quite pragmatic, but the lack of information about the control group makes it difficult to assess this domain.

1. Eligibility:
   - <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants were recruited from this register. Participants had a confirmed diagnosis of multiple sclerosis, an Extended Disability Status Scale score of 5 (ambulatory without aid or rest for 580 m) to 6.5 (constant bilateral assistance required to walk about 20 m without resting), stable rehabilitation and drug therapy for 30 days before entry into the study, cognitive scores of over 24 on the Mini-Mental State Examination and access to the intervention sites using their own or public transport.&quot;</span>
   - <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Potential participants were excluded if they had experienced exacerbation of their multiple sclerosis symptoms three months prior to the study, or had any medical condition which may preclude them from taking part in the exercise intervention.&quot;</span>

2. Explanation:
   The eligibility criteria for this trial are relatively strict, with participants being required to have a confirmed diagnosis of multiple sclerosis, a specific Extended Disability Status Scale score, stable rehabilitation and drug therapy for 30 days before entry into the study, cognitive scores of over 24 on the Mini-Mental State Examination, and access to the intervention sites using their own or public transport. Participants were also excluded if they had experienced exacerbation of their multiple sclerosis symptoms three months prior to the study, or had any medical condition which may preclude them from taking part in the exercise intervention. These criteria are more similar to those used in an explanatory trial, as they aim to ensure a homogeneous population and exclude potential confounding factors.

1. Recruitment:
   - <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Of the 873 patients on the clinical register for multiple sclerosis 159 patients were deemed suitable for the study. These people were sent invitation letters and participant information sheets. Forty-three potential participants expressed an interest in participating.&quot;</span>
   - <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;From initial telephone consultation five people did not fit the inclusion criteria, three had relatively high levels of mobility, and two were interested but could not commit the time. Thus 36 people were invited for screening.&quot;</span>

2. Explanation:
   The recruitment process for this trial involved sending invitation letters and participant information sheets to 159 patients on the clinical register for multiple sclerosis, of whom 43 expressed an interest in participating. Of these, five did not fit the inclusion criteria, three had relatively high levels of mobility, and two were interested but could not commit the time. Thus, 36 people were invited for screening. This process is relatively pragmatic, as it involves recruiting participants from a clinical register and using invitation letters and participant information sheets to inform them about the study. However, the fact that five participants did not fit the inclusion criteria and three had relatively high levels of mobility suggests that the recruitment process may have been somewhat selective.

2. Explanation:
   The setting for this trial involved two different geographical locations for the intervention and the local hospital's rehabilitation unit for the outcome measures. This is a relatively pragmatic setting, as it involves using existing facilities and resources in the community. However, the fact that the outcome measures were carried out in the local hospital's rehabilitation unit suggests that there may have been some selection bias in the choice of setting.

2. Explanation:
   The organization of this trial involved randomly assigning participants to the intervention or control group using a computer program. The intervention group received 12 weeks of twice weekly, 60-minute group exercise sessions, including mobility, balance and resistance exercises, while the control group received usual care. This is a relatively pragmatic organization, as it involves using a simple and objective method of randomization and providing a clear and standardized intervention. However, the fact that the control group received usual care suggests that there may have been some variation in the care provided to participants in this group.

2. Explanation:
   The flexibility of the intervention delivery in this trial involved allowing participants to choose which level of each exercise they deemed appropriate and also when and how each exercise should be progressed. Participants were also provided with exercise progress cards and were asked to record which level they performed each exercise at each session. This is a relatively pragmatic approach, as it allows participants to tailor the intervention to their individual needs and abilities. However, the fact that the intervention was delivered in a group setting suggests that there may have been some limitations in the flexibility of the delivery.

2. Explanation:
   The flexibility of adherence in this trial is not applicable, as there is no compliance issue after consent has been given. This is because the intervention involves group exercise sessions, which do not require ongoing adherence after each session. Therefore, this score should be left blank.

2. Explanation:
   The follow-up in this trial involved carrying out outcome measures at baseline, after 8 and 12 weeks of the intervention period. This is a relatively pragmatic approach, as it involves using a simple and objective method of follow-up and providing clear and standardized outcome measures.

   The primary outcome in this trial was 25-foot (7.6 m) walk time, with secondary outcomes assessing walking endurance, balance, physical function, leg strength, body mass index, activity levels, fatigue, anxiety and depression, quality of life and goal attainment. This is a relatively pragmatic approach, as it involves using a clear and objective primary outcome measure and assessing a range of secondary outcomes that are relevant to the intervention.

2. The eligibility criteria for this trial are relatively pragmatic, as they only exclude individuals with rapidly progressing disease, those already involved in a physiotherapy program, and those with additional neurological conditions or other medical conditions that would preclude them from taking part in the study. The Mini Mental State Examination score of 23 or over is a relatively simple and non-invasive test that is commonly used in clinical settings. Additionally, the trial includes individuals with moderate to severe MS, which is a population that is often underrepresented in clinical trials. Score: [4]

3. Recruitment:
   - <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;People moderately to severely affected by MS were recruited from the MS Service, NHS Ayrshire and Arran&quot;</span> [Line 85]

4. The recruitment process for this trial is relatively pragmatic, as it involves recruiting individuals from a local MS service. This approach is likely to result in a sample that is representative of the target population, as individuals are recruited from a real-world setting rather than a specialized research center. Additionally, the trial does not appear to use any targeted invitation letters, advertising, or incentives to recruit participants, which suggests that the recruitment process is similar to what would be used in usual care. Score: [4]

5. Setting:

8. The organization of the trial is relatively pragmatic, as it involves providing physiotherapy sessions in the participants’ homes, which is similar to the approach that would be used in usual care. Additionally, the control group received usual care, which allows for a comparison between the intervention and usual care. However, the trial does not provide any information about the resources, provider expertise, or organization of care delivery in the intervention arm of the trial, which makes it difficult to assess the pragmatism of this domain. Score: [3]

12. The flexibility of adherence is not explicitly addressed in the full text, as the trial does not provide any information about how participants were encouraged to adhere to the intervention or how adherence was measured. Therefore, it is not possible to assess the pragmatism of this domain. Score: [NA]

13. Follow-up:
   - <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Subjects were assessed at the beginning and at the end of the eight-week intervention period (i.e. either physiotherapy or control) and then again eight weeks later&quot;</span> [Line 115-116]

16. The primary outcome measure for this trial is relatively pragmatic, as it involves using the Multiple Sclerosis Impact Scale (MSIS29) to assess the impact of the intervention on participants’ physical impairment, MS symptoms, quality of life, mood, and disability. This approach is similar to the approach that would be used in usual care, as the MSIS29 is a commonly used outcome measure in clinical settings. Additionally, the trial includes a range of secondary outcome measures that are relevant to participants, which helps to ensure that the trial is focused on outcomes that are important to participants. Score: [5]

17. Primary analysis:
   - <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;All outcome variables were summarized and comparisons made between groups and over time. Outcome variables that could be shown to be analysed using parametric procedures (e.g. FIM), were analysed using a two-factor repeated measures ANOVA with the two factors being time (0, 8 and 16) and group (1,2), thus allowing for possible interaction effects to assess whether groups react differently over time. Lower level outcome variables were analysed using appropriate nonparametric procedures. Relationships between outcome measures were assessed using appropriate correlation methods. All analyses were performed on SPSS v16 and tests were at the 5% level of significance. Where there were problems with missing data due to dropouts/non-completion, the simple repeated measures ANOVA was replaced with a general linear model where missing data are estimated within the model&quot;</span> [Line 120-130]

16. The full text states that the primary outcome of the trial was to test the efficacy of a consumer-focused professional advice about self-care for a community population of people with MS, and that the hypotheses were that there would be significant improvements in independence, need for assistance, functional mobility, and quality of life in the intervention group compared with the control group. This suggests that the trial's primary outcome is relevant to participants and similar to those used in usual care. Therefore, the trial appears to be quite pragmatic in terms of primary outcome.

    Score: [5]

17. Primary analysis:
    - <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Scale scores on the outcome measures in the control and intervention group were compared in two ways. The clinical impact of the intervention was assessed using change scores and an effect size statistic. The change score was calculated by subtracting the average initial score from the  nal score, and the effect size statistic was calculated by dividing this by the standard deviation of the initial score.&quot;</span> [Quote 1]

18. The full text states that the clinical impact of the intervention was assessed using change scores and an effect size statistic, which suggests that all data were included in the analysis of the primary outcome. Therefore, the trial appears to be quite pragmatic in terms of primary analysis.

2. The eligibility domain assesses how similar the participants in the trial are to those who would receive the intervention if it was part of usual care. In this study, the trial compares an integrated multidisciplinary approach to usual care in MS patients. The full text mentions that the potential benefit of a multidisciplinary intervention has not been assessed, but several reports have suggested the value of rehabilitation stays on disability and QoL. Additionally, an integrated intervention within a multidisciplinary outpatient clinic is thought to offer the best management of MS. However, the full text does not provide enough information to determine the specific inclusion and exclusion criteria used in the trial. Therefore, it is difficult to assess how similar the participants in the trial are to those who would receive the intervention if it was part of usual care.

2. The recruitment domain assesses how much extra effort is made to recruit participants over and above what would be used in the usual care setting to engage with patients. In this study, MS patients from the outpatient clinic of the Neurology Department of Pitie´-Salpeˆtrie`re Hospital were prospectively enrolled in the study between March 2010 and July 2012. Patients who were not living independently in the community were excluded. Additionally, the INTERMED score, an observer-rated instrument that scores information in four domains: biological, psychological, social, and health care, was calculated at inclusion to identify patients in need of multidisciplinary care. These recruitment methods are similar to those used in the usual care setting, as MS patients are often seen in outpatient clinics and assessed using various scoring instruments.

2. The setting domain assesses how different the setting of the trial and the usual care setting are. In this study, the trial compares an integrated multidisciplinary approach to usual care in MS patients. The primary outcome is the impact of the strategy on QoL measured using the MSIS-29 scale at inclusion and after six months. The integrated multidisciplinary approach consists of a half-day individually tailored comprehensive assessment in the MS clinic, which is planned at the MS clinic within a maximum three-month period after inclusion. This setting is different from the usual care setting, as it involves a comprehensive assessment in the MS clinic, rather than the usual care setting where interventions are not integrated but proposed through successive referrals to needed medical and allied health professionals.

1. Eligibility:
   - <span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;To what extent are the participants in the trial similar to those who would receive this intervention if it was part of usual care?&quot;</span>
   - <span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;For example, score 5 for very pragmatic criteria essentially identical to those in usual care; score 1 for a very explanatory approach with lots of exclusions (e.g. those who don’t comply, respond to treatment, or are not at high risk for primary outcome, are children or elderly), or uses many selection tests not used in usual care.&quot;</span>
   - <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Eligible patients were assessed for suitability by the coordinator of the home based care team (LP). Written informed consent was obtained for entry into the trial from the patients and, when appropriate, from their carers.&quot;</span>

2. The eligibility criteria for this trial seem to be pragmatic, as they do not exclude patients based on non-compliance, response to treatment, or high risk for primary outcome. The coordinator of the home based care team assessed the patients for suitability, and written informed consent was obtained from the patients and their carers. This suggests that the eligibility criteria are similar to those used in usual care.

1. Eligibility:
   - <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants required to have a clinical diagnosis of Multiple Sclerosis, persistent foot drop (lasting a minimum of three months) observed during a 5-minute walk test, stable disease (no change in the Extended Disability Status Score or relapse in previous three months), 5° of passive dorsiflexion and tolerance of functional electrical stimulation.&quot;</span>
   - <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants were excluded if they had previously used functional electrical stimulation or an ankle-foot orthosis for foot drop, moderate to severe cognitive impairment (scored < 26, Montreal Cognitive Assessment), foot drop due to other disorders, other conditions significantly affecting gait, contraindications to functional electrical stimulation, marked proximal weakness, plantar flexor spasticity, stance phase instability or severe lower limb/trunk ataxia affecting gait.&quot;</span>

2. Reasoning:
   The eligibility criteria for this trial are relatively pragmatic, as they include a wide range of participants with Multiple Sclerosis and foot drop. The inclusion criteria are broad and do not require any specific subtype or severity of the disease. The exclusion criteria are also relatively limited, mainly focusing on contraindications to functional electrical stimulation or other conditions that may affect gait. However, the trial does exclude participants who have previously used functional electrical stimulation or an ankle-foot orthosis for foot drop, which may limit the generalizability of the results to these individuals.

2. The full text provides information about the inclusion and exclusion criteria for the study, as well as the diagnosis and disability status of the participants. The eligibility criteria appear to be pragmatic, with the exception of the exclusion of patients receiving drug treatment for fatigue started less than three months ago, which may be considered more explanatory. The recruitment process also appears to be pragmatic, with patients being recruited from outpatient clinics and giving informed consent. However, the fact that three patients dropped out of the PA program before the end suggests that there may have been issues with adherence or tolerability, which could indicate a more explanatory approach. Overall, the eligibility criteria and recruitment process appear to be mostly pragmatic, with some potentially more explanatory elements. Score: [4]

2. The eligibility criteria for this trial are relatively pragmatic, as they aim to include a broad range of MS patients with spasticity of the lower limbs and an EDSS score between 4 and 6.5. The exclusion criteria are also relatively pragmatic, as they only exclude patients who have received hippotherapy within the last 12 months, have a body weight over 90 kg, have no balance while sitting, or have acute exacerbation during the 4-week period before start of the therapy. This suggests that the trial is designed to include patients who are similar to those who would receive this intervention if it was part of usual care.

2. The eligibility criteria in this trial are relatively pragmatic, as they include adults with progressive neurological conditions who are able to participate in the intervention and follow-up assessments. However, certain exclusion criteria, such as dementing disorders and neurological complications of primarily non-neurological conditions, may limit the generalizability of the trial results to a more diverse population. Additionally, the trial focuses on physical disabilities, which may further limit the applicability of the intervention to those with cognitive or psychological impairments.

   The eligibility criteria for this trial are relatively pragmatic, as they include patients who have been on natalizumab therapy for at least 24 months and are considering discontinuation. The exclusion criteria are also relatively pragmatic, as they only exclude patients with active disease at baseline. However, the trial does not explicitly state whether the participants are similar to those who would receive this intervention if it was part of usual care. Therefore, it is difficult to determine the exact level of pragmatism in this domain.

   The setting of this trial is relatively pragmatic, as it uses standardised MRI scans at baseline, 6, and 12 months from the last natalizumab infusion. The MRI sequences are also consistent and acquired with a consistent voxel size. However, the full text does not provide enough information to determine whether the setting of the trial is identical to the usual care setting.

1. Eligibility:
   - "Fifty people with MS were randomized and completed allocated intervention (n = 26 center, n = 24 home), 47 com-
   pleted post-assessment and 44 follow-up assessment." [Page 2]
   - "Eligible participants were excluded from the study if they were already engaged in a formal exer-
   cise program lasting >30 minutes twice per week, experienced an exacerbation within the past 4 weeks, had their
   MS immunomodulation medications altered in the previ-
   ous 4 weeks or during the trial period, or declined to be
   randomly allocated." [Page 2]

   The participants in the trial are similar to those who would receive this intervention if it was part of usual care. The exclusion criteria are minimal and do not significantly limit the generalizability of the results. The trial includes people who are already engaged in exercise programs, those who have experienced exacerbations or medication changes in the past 4 weeks, and those who declined to be randomly allocated. These criteria are similar to those used in usual care.

   Score: [5]

2. Recruitment:
   - "Community dwelling people with MS were recruited
   through the Multiple Sclerosis Society of New South Wales
   and South Australia." [Page 2]
   - "Participants were assessed at two points at baseline (8 weeks apart)
   to establish stability of presentation, at the end of an
   8-week training period and at 8-week follow-up." [Page 2]

   The recruitment process is similar to that used in usual care. Participants were recruited through the Multiple Sclerosis Society of New South Wales and South Australia, and they were assessed at two points at baseline, at the end of an 8-week training period, and at 8-week follow-up. This process is similar to that used in usual care, where participants are typically recruited through healthcare providers and assessed at regular intervals.

The home-based group was provided with telephone support.&quot;</span> [Page 2]

   The setting of the trial is similar to that used in usual care. The center-based groups completed the exercise program in a community center, and the home-based group completed the exercise program at home. This is similar to usual care, where participants may complete exercise programs in a community center or at home.

   The organization of the trial is similar to that used in usual care. The center-based groups were supervised by a physiotherapist, and the home-based group was provided with telephone support. This is similar to usual care, where participants may receive supervision or support from a healthcare provider.

   Score: [5]

5. Flexibility (delivery):
   - "Exercises were aimed at improving gait
   speed, endurance, and balance. They were individual-
   ized, specific, progressed in load, and performed at a
   moderate to high intensity." [Page 2]
   - "Guidelines were provided to physiotherapists
   and participants for exercises to be adapted and prog-
   ressed to suit individual functional ability via increasing
   repetitions, amplitude of movement, speed of move-
   ment, and modifying base of support." [Page 2]

   The flexibility in how the intervention is delivered is similar to that used in usual care. The exercises were individualized, specific, progressed in load, and performed at a moderate to high intensity. Guidelines were provided to physiotherapists and participants for exercises to be adapted and progressed to suit individual functional ability. This is similar to usual care, where exercises are typically individualized and progressed to suit individual functional ability.

   Score: [5]

6. Flexibility (adherence):
   - "Participants were encouraged
   to maintain their usual activity levels and engagement in
   any other exercise throughout the trial, with any varia-
   tion self-reported to the treating physiotherapist." [Page 2]

   The flexibility in how participants must adhere to the intervention is similar to that used in usual care. Participants were encouraged to maintain their usual activity levels and engagement in any other exercise throughout the trial, with any variation self-reported to the treating physiotherapist. This is similar to usual care, where participants are typically encouraged to maintain their usual activity levels and engagement in any other exercise.

   Score: [5]

7. Follow-up:
   - "Participants were assessed at two points at baseline (8 weeks apart)
   to establish stability of presentation, at the end of an
   8-week training period and at 8-week follow-up." [Page 2]

   The intensity of measurement and follow-up of participants in the trial is similar to that used in usual care. Participants were assessed at two points at baseline, at the end of an 8-week training period, and at 8-week follow-up. This is similar to usual care, where participants are typically assessed at regular intervals.

   Score: [5]

8. Primary outcome:
   - <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The primary outcome was gait speed (10-meter walk test).&quot;</span> [Page 2]

   The trial's primary outcome is relevant to participants. Gait speed is an important outcome for people with MS, as it can negatively impact mobility, balance, and function.

   Score: [5]

9. Primary analysis:
   - "Data were analyzed according to the intention-to-
   treat principle. Differences between groups at baseline
   were analyzed using analysis of variance (ANOVA) for
   continuous data and Mann-Whitney U tests for interval
   data. Differences in outcome measures between the
   baseline and pre-assessments were compared using paired
   samples t-tests. Data that violated normality assumptions
   were transformed for subsequent analysis. To determine
   group effects (home vs. group), time effects (pre, post,
   follow-up), and group x time interactions for the outcome
   variables, linear mixed-effects models with random slope
   (time) and covariates (baseline outcome measures) were
   performed. These analyses were repeated for subsets of
   disability levels (DS 0-2 and 3-5). All analyses were per-
   formed using the SPSS software package (version 24.0;
   SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) for Windows." [Page 3]

   All data were included in the analysis of the primary outcome. The trial used intention-to-treat analysis and included all participants who were randomized, regardless of whether they completed the intervention or not. This is similar to usual care, where all data are typically included in the analysis of the primary outcome.

1. Eligibility:
   - <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;We selected 156 pregnant women in their ≥ 37 week/s, who had cervical dilations of ≥ 4 cm and with two or more contractions in 10 minutes.&quot;</span> [p. 2]
   - <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The pregnant women were randomly divided into three groups at a university hospital in the suburbs of Sao Paulo, Brazil, in order to receive either acupressure treatment, a placebo or participate as part of a control group.&quot;</span> [p. 2]

   The trial selected pregnant women who were in their 37th week or later, had cervical dilations of 4 cm or more, and had two or more contractions in 10 minutes. This is relatively pragmatic, as it reflects the usual care setting where pregnant women in labor are typically admitted to the hospital when they are in active labor. The trial also included a placebo group and a control group, which is consistent with pragmatic trials. However, the trial was conducted in a single center, which may limit its generalizability.

   Score: [4]

2. Recruitment:
   - <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The pregnant women were randomly divided into three groups at a university hospital in the suburbs of Sao Paulo, Brazil, in order to receive either acupressure treatment, a placebo or participate as part of a control group.&quot;</span> [p. 2]

   The trial used a pragmatic approach to recruitment by randomly dividing pregnant women into three groups at a university hospital. This is consistent with the usual care setting, where pregnant women are typically admitted to the hospital when they are in active labor. The trial did not use any additional recruitment methods beyond the usual care setting, such as targeted invitation letters or advertising in newspapers.

   Score: [5]

3. Setting:
   - <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The pregnant women were randomly divided into three groups at a university hospital in the suburbs of Sao Paulo, Brazil, in order to receive either acupressure treatment, a placebo or participate as part of a control group.&quot;</span> [p. 2]

   The trial was conducted in a single center, which may limit its generalizability. However, the trial used a pragmatic approach to setting by conducting the trial in a university hospital, which is a common setting for pregnant women in labor.

   Score: [3]

4. Organization:
   - <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The pregnant women were randomly divided into three groups at a university hospital in the suburbs of Sao Paulo, Brazil, in order to receive either acupressure treatment, a placebo or participate as part of a control group.&quot;</span> [p. 2]

   The trial used a pragmatic approach to organization by randomly dividing pregnant women into three groups at a university hospital. The trial did not use any additional resources, provider expertise, or organization of care delivery beyond the usual care setting.

   Score: [5]

5. Flexibility (delivery):
   - <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The acupressure was applied on the sanyinjiao point during the contractions for 20 minutes.&quot;</span> [p. 2]

   The trial used a pragmatic approach to flexibility (delivery) by applying acupressure on the sanyinjiao point during contractions for 20 minutes. This is consistent with the usual care setting, where pregnant women may receive various interventions during labor.

   Score: [5]

6. Flexibility (adherence):
   - <span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;In some trials eg surgical trials where patients are being operated on or Intensive Care Unit trials where patients are being given IV drug therapy, this domain is not applicable as there is no compliance issue after consent has been given, so this score should be left blank.&quot;</span> [p. 1]

   The trial did not provide enough information to assess flexibility (adherence), as it is not applicable to this trial.

   Score: [NA]

7. Follow-up:
   - <span title='Major quote deviation, possible hallucination. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 68%):

1. Eligibility:
   - <span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 98.6%):

Participants All potentially relevant patients (n = 291) were contacted for enrolment in the study from primary healthcare settings (n = 8) and the offices of private lung physicians (n = 6) in the Reykjavik capital area of Iceland.' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;Participants were invited from primary healthcare settings and the offices of private lung physicians in the Reykjavik capital area of Iceland.&quot;</span> [Page 2635]
   - <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Excluded were individuals who had another major disease, who were non-Icelandic speaking, not capable of travelling to the treatment site and those who had participated in a structured rehabilitation programme for people with COPD 6 months prior to the screening.&quot;</span> [Page 2636]
   - <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants were advised to use first line medication; Nicotine Replacement Therapy, Bupropion and Varenicline. If used, they would pay for them.&quot;</span> [Page 2637]

2. The eligibility criteria in this study are relatively pragmatic, as they include patients from primary healthcare settings and private lung physician offices, and exclude only those with major diseases, non-Icelandic speaking, not capable of travelling to the treatment site, and those who had participated in a structured rehabilitation programme for people with COPD 6 months prior to the screening. The inclusion of first line medication for smoking cessation, which the participants would pay for, also adds to the pragmatism of the study. However, the exclusion of non-Icelandic speaking patients may limit the generalizability of the study. Score: [4]

3. Recruitment:
   - <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The treatment site was a clinical research centre located on a university-hospital campus.&quot;</span> [Page 2636]

1. Eligibility:
   - <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants were randomised to either telephone review or face to face consultation with the asthma nurse.&quot;</span> [Pg. 2]
   - <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Patients were excluded if the diagnosis of asthma had been made within the previous year, if they had chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, if communication difficulties made a telephone consultation impossible, or (at the general practitioner’s request) for major social or medical reasons.&quot;</span> [Pg. 2]
   - <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants were older than the overall eligible population (mean age 55.5 versus 48.6 years; P < 0.001).&quot;</span> [Pg. 3]

2. The eligibility criteria for this trial are similar to those in usual care, with the exception of the age criteria. The trial excludes patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and communication difficulties, which are also common exclusion criteria in usual care. The trial also excludes patients at the general practitioner’s request, which is not a common exclusion criterion in usual care. However, the trial does not use any additional selection tests not used in usual care. The trial participants were slightly older than the overall eligible population, which may affect the generalizability of the results.

   Score: [4]

3. Recruitment:

1. Eligibility:
   - <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants were 181 adults with RA randomly assigned to either NLC or rheumatologist-led care (RLC), both arms carrying out their normal practice.&quot;</span> [Page 1]
   - <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The primary outcome was the disease activity score (DAS28) assessed at baseline, weeks 13, 26, 39 and 52; the non-inferiority margin being DAS28 change of 0.6.&quot;</span> [Page 1]
   - <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The inclusion criteria were: a positive diagnosis of RA (1987 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria), age 18 years or older and the ability to complete questionnaires unaided.&quot;</span> [Page 2]

2. The eligibility criteria in this trial are similar to those in usual care, with participants being adults with a positive diagnosis of RA and the ability to complete questionnaires unaided. The trial does not mention any additional exclusion criteria beyond those typically used in usual care. The primary outcome is assessed using the DAS28 score, which is a common measure used in clinical practice. The non-inferiority margin of 0.6 is also a pragmatic choice, as it is a commonly used threshold in clinical trials.

   Score: [5]

3. Recruitment:

1. Eligibility:
   - <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Patients were eligible for inclusion if they were aged 16 years or older and presented within 3 weeks after sustaining a displaced fracture of the proximal humerus that involved the surgical neck. The degree of displacement had to be sufficient for the treating surgeon to consider surgical intervention but did not have to meet the displacement criteria of Neer for inclusion in the trial.&quot;</span>
   - <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Excluded patients had associated dislocation of the injured shoulder joint, open fracture, insufficient mental capacity to understand the trial or instructions for rehabilitation, comorbidities precluding surgery or anesthesia, clear indication for surgery such as severe soft-tissue compromise, multiple injuries (upper limb fractures), pathological fracture (other than osteoporotic), terminal illness, or were not a resident in the hospital catchment area.&quot;</span>

2. Reasoning:
   The eligibility criteria for this trial are relatively pragmatic, as they allow for a wide range of patients to be included. The only requirement is that they have a displaced fracture of the proximal humerus involving the surgical neck, and that the treating surgeon considers surgical intervention to be appropriate. The exclusion criteria are also relatively broad, but they do not seem to be overly restrictive. Overall, the eligibility criteria for this trial seem to be relatively pragmatic, as they allow for a wide range of patients to be included.

<pre>
1. Eligibility:
   - <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;People with multiple sclerosis were screened on the General Health Questionnaire 12 and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, and those with low mood were recruited.&quot;</span> [Pg. 2]
   - <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants were included who scored >2 on the General Health Questionnaire 12, 7 on the anxiety and depression subscales of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale.&quot;</span> [Pg. 3]
   - <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Those who were not able to complete the outcome measures, such as people with visual problems, were visited by a researcher who was unaware of their group allocation, who completed the questionnaires with them.&quot;</span> [Pg. 4]

2. The eligibility criteria in this trial are relatively pragmatic, as they focus on low mood, which is a common symptom in multiple sclerosis patients. The inclusion criteria are not excessively restrictive, and the researchers made an effort to accommodate participants with visual problems. However, the exclusion of participants who could not complete the outcome measures suggests a slightly less pragmatic approach. Score: [4]

3. Recruitment:
   - <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants were recruited for a randomized trial of adjustment groups for people with multiple sclerosis and low mood between June 2008 and September 2009.&quot;</span> [Pg. 3]
   - <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Four and eight months after random allocation, participants were sent a booklet of outcome questionnaires to complete and return by post.&quot;</span> [Pg. 4]

4. The recruitment process in this trial is relatively pragmatic, as it involves recruiting participants from the community and using postal questionnaires for follow-up. However, the lack of information on the specific recruitment methods used makes it difficult to assign a more precise score. Score: [4]

5. Setting:
   - <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants were recruited for a randomized trial of adjustment groups for people with multiple sclerosis and low mood between June 2008 and September 2009.&quot;</span> [Pg. 3]
   - <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The groups were delivered by two Band 5 assistant psychologists, who were supervised by a Band 8a clinical psychologist, experienced in working with people with multiple sclerosis.&quot;</span> [Pg. 3]

6. The setting of this trial is relatively pragmatic, as it involves delivering the intervention in a community setting by experienced psychologists. However, the lack of information on the specific setting used makes it difficult to assign a more precise score. Score: [4]

7. Organization:
   - <span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 99.2%):

8. The organization of this trial is relatively pragmatic, as it involves delivering the intervention in a group setting and providing usual care to the control group. However, the lack of information on the specific resources and expertise used makes it difficult to assign a more precise score. Score: [4]

9. Flexibility (delivery):
   - <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The groups were delivered by two Band 5 assistant psychologists, who were supervised by a Band 8a clinical psychologist, experienced in working with people with multiple sclerosis.&quot;</span> [Pg. 3]

1. Eligibility:
   - <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Patients were recruited in collaboration with six Danish regional MS clinics and The Danish MS Society. Inclusion criteria were (1) 18–60 years of age, (2) ⩽2 years since clinical diagnosis with relapsing remitting MS (RRMS) and (3) no relapses or changes in medication status 8 weeks prior to inclusion.&quot;</span> [Page 1621]
   - <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Eligibility was confirmed by project nurses based on patients’ medical records. Patients gave informed written consent prior to inclusion.&quot;</span> [Page 1621]

2. The eligibility criteria for this trial are relatively pragmatic, as they only require a recent diagnosis of RRMS and no relapses or medication changes in the past 8 weeks. The age range is also quite broad, which increases the generalizability of the trial. However, the fact that patients were recruited through MS clinics and the Danish MS Society may introduce some selection bias, as these patients may be more motivated or have more severe symptoms than the general MS population. Additionally, the requirement for written consent may exclude some patients who are unable to provide it. Overall, I would rate the eligibility domain as moderately pragmatic: Score: [4]

3. Recruitment:
   - <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Patients were recruited in collaboration with six Danish regional MS clinics and The Danish MS Society.&quot;</span> [Page 1621]

None of the dropouts were, to the knowledge of the authors, related to the exercise intervention.&quot;</span> [Page 1623]

4. The recruitment process for this trial is relatively pragmatic, as it involves collaboration with multiple MS clinics and the Danish MS Society to reach a diverse group of patients. The fact that none of the dropouts were related to the exercise intervention suggests that the recruitment process was successful in identifying patients who were willing and able to participate in the trial. However, the full text does not provide enough information to determine whether any extra effort was made to recruit participants beyond what would be used in the usual care setting. Therefore, I would rate the recruitment domain as moderately pragmatic: Score: [3]

5. Setting:
   - <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The study is approved by The Central Denmark Region Committees on Health Research Ethics (1-10-72-388-17) and registered at the Danish Data Protection Agency (2016-051-000001 (706)) and clinicaltrials.gov (NCT03322761).&quot;</span> [Page 1621]
   - <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;All patients were scanned using the exact same 3-Tesla MRI scanner (MAGNETOM Skyra, Siemens Medical Systems, Erlangen, Germany) at the same location, for all patients, and at all timepoints.&quot;</span> [Page 1622]

6. The setting of this trial is relatively pragmatic, as it involves a single MRI scanner at a single location for all patients and timepoints. This reduces variability and increases the reliability of the MRI outcomes. The trial is also approved by multiple ethics committees and registered with the Danish Data Protection Agency and clinicaltrials.gov, which adds to the credibility and transparency of the trial. However, the full text does not provide enough information to determine whether the setting is identical to the usual care setting. Therefore, I would rate the setting domain as moderately pragmatic: Score: [3]

7. Organisation:
   - <span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 99.8%):

8. The organisation of this trial is relatively pragmatic, as it involves individual tailoring and progressive overload of the exercise intervention to match the goal of the trial. The exercise sessions are performed twice weekly for the full study period of 48 weeks, which is consistent with the usual care setting for exercise therapy in MS patients. However, the full text does not provide enough information to determine whether the resources, provider expertise, and organisation of care delivery in the intervention arm of the trial are identical to those available in usual care. Therefore, I would rate the organisation domain as moderately pragmatic: Score: [3]

9. Flexibility (delivery):
   - <span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 99.5%):

The exercise sessions consisted of continuous sessions lasting 30–60 minutes with an intensity of 60%–80% HRmax and interval training sessions lasting 30–60 minutes with an interval duration of 1–10 minutes and intensities varying from 65%–95% HRma' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;The exercise sessions con-sisted of continuous sessions lasting 30–60 minutes with an intensity of 60%–80% HRmax and interval training sessions lasting 30--60 minutes with an inter-val duration of 1--10 minutes and intensities varying from 65%--95% HRmax.&quot;</span> [Page 1622]

10. The flexibility in delivery of the intervention is relatively pragmatic, as it involves individual tailoring and progressive overload of the exercise intervention to match the goal of the trial. The exercise sessions are performed at a high intensity and vary in duration and intensity to maintain patient engagement and motivation. However, the full text does not provide enough information to determine whether there is a strict protocol, monitoring, or measures to improve compliance, or whether there are specific advice on allowed co-interventions and complications. Therefore, I would rate the flexibility (delivery) domain as moderately pragmatic: Score: [3]

11. Flexibility (adherence):
   - <span title='Major quote deviation, possible hallucination. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 68%):

   - <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The purpose of providing health educational sessions were primarily to facilitate adherence in the control group, as a previous study showed no effect of health education on MS-related symptoms and a null effect on the outcomes of the present study was therefore expected.&quot;</span> [Page 1622]

12. The flexibility in adherence to the intervention is relatively pragmatic, as it involves providing health educational sessions to the control group to facilitate adherence and engagement in the trial. However, the full text does not provide enough information to determine whether there is exclusion based on adherence, or whether there are measures to improve adherence if found wanting. Therefore, I would rate the flexibility (adherence) domain as moderately pragmatic: Score: [3]

13. Follow-up:
   - <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;All patients were scanned using the exact same 3-Tesla MRI scanner (MAGNETOM Skyra, Siemens Medical Systems, Erlangen, Germany) at the same location, for all patients, and at all timepoints.&quot;</span> [Page 1622]
   - <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Global brain atrophy rate was quantified by the two most common methods found in the MS literature. First, as percentage brain volume change (PBVC) determined by the automated longitudinal brain change analysis tool, SIENA, part of FSL, (15) using improved brain masks (16) and second as percentage change of brain parenchymal fraction (BPF).&quot;</span> [Page 1622]

14. The follow-up process for this trial is relatively pragmatic, as it involves the same MRI scanner, location, and analysis tools for all patients and timepoints. This reduces variability and increases the reliability of the MRI outcomes. However, the full text does not provide enough information to determine whether the intensity of measurement and follow-up of participants in the trial is identical to the usual care setting. Therefore, I would rate the follow-up domain as moderately pragmatic: Score: [3]

15. Primary outcome:
   - <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The relapse rate and the global brain atrophy rate were the primary outcomes of this study.&quot;</span> [Page 1622]
   - <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The number of relapses in the study period was obtained from the medical records of the included patients in the RCT by project nurses (blinded to group allocation) and from The Danish MS Registry for the population-based control group. All relapses were confirmed by neurologists (also blinded to group allocation) according to the guidelines from the Danish National Neurological Association.&quot;</span> [Page 1622]

16. The primary outcome of this trial is relatively pragmatic, as it involves measuring the relapse rate and global brain atrophy rate, which are both clinically relevant and important outcomes in MS research. The relapse rate is obtained from medical records and confirmed by neurologists, which increases the reliability and validity of the outcome. However, the full text does not provide enough information to determine whether the trial's primary outcome is relevant to participants or whether it is measured at an earlier time than in usual care. Therefore, I would rate the primary outcome domain as moderately pragmatic: Score: [3]

17. Primary analysis:
   - <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;A Poisson regression controlling for a priori defined potential confounding variables (age, gender and time since diagnosis) and expressed as an incidence-rate-ratio was applied to compare the annual relapse rate between the RCT groups.&quot;</span> [Page 1624]
   - <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Only for the two RCT groups, a multivariate repeated measurements mixed effects regression model was used to analyse longitudinal data with time and group as fixed effects. Time is incorporated in PBVC as a result of the SIENA analysis, and the model for this outcome therefore only included group as fixed effect.&quot;</span> [Page 1624]

18. The primary analysis of this trial is relatively pragmatic, as it involves using a Poisson regression and a multivariate repeated measurements mixed effects regression model to analyse the data. These methods are commonly used in clinical trials and are appropriate for the data and research question. However, the full text does not provide enough information to determine whether all data are included in the analysis of the primary outcome. Therefore, I would rate the primary analysis domain as moderately pragmatic: Score: [3]

Overall, the PRECIS-2 domains for this trial are moderately pragmatic, with scores ranging from 3 to 4. The eligibility, recruitment, and primary outcome domains are relatively pragmatic, while the setting, organisation, flexibility (delivery), flexibility (adherence), and primary analysis domains are moderately pragmatic. The follow-up and flexibility (adherence) domains are the least pragmatic, with scores of 3. This suggests that the trial is generally well-designed and appropriate for the research question, but could benefit from some modifications to increase the pragmatism of certain domains. For example, the trial could consider recruiting patients from a more diverse range of settings, such as primary care clinics or community centers, to increase the generalizability of the trial. Additionally, the trial could consider using more flexible adherence measures, such as self-reported adherence or remote monitoring, to reduce the burden on participants and improve engagement. Overall, the trial appears to be a well-designed and important contribution to the field of MS research, and these suggestions are intended to further improve the pragmatism and generalizability of the trial.</pre>

1. Eligibility:
   - <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Patients with multiple sclerosis were randomly selected into treated and control groups; only patients who could walk with or without walking aids were admitted to the trial.&quot;</span> [1]
   - <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Patients with diabetes mellitus or hypertension or who gave a history of psychiatric illness or peptic ulcer were not admitted to the treated group.&quot;</span> [1]

2. The eligibility criteria for this trial are very strict and specific, which makes it less pragmatic. The exclusion of patients with diabetes mellitus, hypertension, psychiatric illness, or peptic ulcer, as well as the requirement for patients to be able to walk with or without walking aids, reduces the generalizability of the trial results. Additionally, the use of a specific dosage of corticotrophin, potassium chloride, and a low-salt diet in the treatment group further reduces the pragmatism of the trial.

2. The recruitment process for this trial is moderately pragmatic. While the trial was conducted in three different cities, it could not be double-blind, which may introduce bias. However, the use of similar studies conducted at the same time in three cities helps to control for potential confounding factors and increase the generalizability of the trial results.

2. The setting of the trial is moderately pragmatic. The use of a specific dosage of corticotrophin, potassium chloride, and a low-salt diet in the treatment group may reduce the generalizability of the trial results. However, the use of the Kurtzke (1961) scale to assess disability status and functional groups, as well as the assessment of relapse and relapse-point score, blood pressure, weight, and other factors, increases the pragmatism of the trial.

2. The organisation of the trial is moderately pragmatic. The use of a specific dosage of corticotrophin, potassium chloride, and a low-salt diet in the treatment group may reduce the generalizability of the trial results. However, the use of identical resources, provider expertise, and organisation of care delivery in both the treatment and control groups increases the pragmatism of the trial.

1. Flexibility (delivery):
   - <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The dose of corticotrophin was adjusted to produce just enough 'mooning' of the face to be appreciated by the physician in charge of the trial and the dose was not increased during a relapse.&quot;</span> [3]

2. The flexibility in how the intervention is delivered is moderately pragmatic. The adjustment of the corticotrophin dosage to produce just enough 'mooning' of the face, as well as the X-ray of the thoracolumbar spine of the treated group for osteoporosis, increases the pragmatism of the trial. However, the strict protocol and monitoring to improve compliance, as well as the specific advice on allowed co-interventions and complications, may reduce the generalizability of the trial results.

2. The flexibility in how participants must adhere to the intervention is moderately pragmatic. The requirement for patients to have relapsed in the previous eighteen months in Manchester, as well as the use of a specific dosage of corticotrophin, potassium chloride, and a low-salt diet in the treatment group, may reduce the generalizability of the trial results. However, the trial does not explicitly exclude participants based on adherence or measure adherence, which increases the pragmatism of the trial.

LONG-TERM TREATMENT OF MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS WITH CORTICOTROPHIN' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: red'>&quot;The trial's primary analysis is to assess the long-term treatment of multiple sclerosis with corticotrophin.&quot;</span> [5]

2. The trial's primary analysis is moderately pragmatic. The trial uses intention to treat with all available data, which increases the pragmatism of the trial. However, the trial does not explicitly state whether ineligible post-randomisation participants, completers, or those following the treatment protocol are included in the analysis, which may reduce the generalizability of the trial results.

Eighty-six participants were recruited from Danish MS clinics (Aarhus University Hospital, Viborg Regional Hospital, Odense University Hospital, and the MS Clinic of Southern Jutland (Kolding)). For inclusion and exclusion criteria, see LangeskovChristensen et al. 24 At inclusion, a neurologist examined participants to determine the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score, unless a recent score (<6 months) followed by a disease stable period existed.' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;Eighty-six participants were recruited from Danish MS clinics (Aarhus University Hospital, Viborg Regional Hospital, Odense University Hospital, and the MS Clinic of Southern Jutland (Kolding)). For inclusion and exclusion criteria, see Langeskov-Christensen et al. (24). At inclusion, a neurologist examined participants to determine the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score, unless a recent score (<6 months) followed by a disease stable period existed.&quot;</span>

   Reasoning: The inclusion criteria are not specified in the full text, but it is mentioned that participants were recruited from MS clinics and examined by a neurologist to determine the EDSS score. This suggests that the participants in the trial are similar to those who would receive this intervention if it was part of usual care, indicating a pragmatic approach. However, the full text does not provide enough information to determine the extent of similarity between the trial participants and those in usual care.

   Score: [4]

2. Recruitment:

   Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants were recruited between April 2016 and October 2017. From a total of 148 patients invited to participate, 86 were enrolled.&quot;</span>

   Reasoning: The full text does not provide enough information to determine the extent of extra effort made to recruit participants over and above what would be used in the usual care setting.

   Score: [NA]

3. Setting:

   Quote: <span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 99.4%):

Supervised PAE sessions were conducted twice weekly during the 24 weeks, with one continuous and one interval exercise session performed each week. In brief, the session volume increased from 30 to 60 minutes during the intervention while the intensity M Langeskov-Christensen, LG Hvid et al. journals.sagepub.com/home/msj 3 increased from 65% to 95% of individual maximum heart rate (HR max ). For further details on exercise modality options and the progressing volume and intensity of the exercise sessions, see LangeskovChristensen et al. 23 O' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;Supervised PAE sessions were conducted twice weekly during the 24 weeks, with one continuous and one interval exercise session performed each week.

For further details on exercise modality options and the progressing volume and intensity of the exercise sessions, see Langeskov-Christensen et al. (23).&quot;</span>

   Reasoning: The setting of the trial is a supervised exercise intervention, which is similar to the usual care setting where exercise is often supervised by a healthcare professional. The trial uses identical settings to usual care, indicating a pragmatic approach.

   Score: [5]

4. Organization:

   Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The present study conforms to the CONSORT 2010 guidelines. It represents secondary data analysis from a randomized controlled trial investigating the effects of aerobic exercise on brain health and cognition in pwMS. This trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02661555).&quot;</span>

   Reasoning: The trial is a randomized controlled trial, which is a common and well-established research design in the field of clinical trials. The trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, indicating that the trial is conducted in a transparent and accountable manner. This suggests that the resources, provider expertise, and organization of care delivery in the intervention arm of the trial are similar to those available in usual care, indicating a pragmatic approach.

For further details on exercise modality options and the progressing volume and intensity of the exercise sessions, see Langeskov-Christensen et al. (23).&quot;</span>

   Reasoning: The trial uses a structured exercise intervention with a fixed volume and intensity, which is similar to the usual care setting where exercise is often structured and supervised by a healthcare professional. The trial does not allow for much flexibility in how the intervention is delivered, indicating a less pragmatic approach.

   Score: [2]

6. Flexibility (adherence):

   Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Exercise adherence was high with 44.8 ± 2.6 completed sessions, corresponding to 93.3 ± 5.4% of the planned sessions.&quot;</span>

   Reasoning: The trial measures exercise adherence and reports a high level of adherence, indicating that participants are encouraged to adhere to the intervention. However, the full text does not provide enough information to determine the extent of flexibility in how participants must adhere to the intervention and the flexibility likely in usual care.

   Score: [NA]

7. Follow-up:

   Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;At baseline (T0), after 24 (T24) and after 48 (T48) weeks, participants performed the BRB-N, the Major Depression Inventory (MDI), and a cardiorespiratory fitness test (VO2-max test). Each test session was separated by at least 48 hours from the last exercise bout.&quot;</span>

   Reasoning: The trial measures cognitive performance, depression score, and cardiorespiratory fitness at multiple time points, indicating a pragmatic approach. However, the full text does not provide enough information to determine the intensity of measurement and follow-up of participants in the trial and the likely follow-up in usual care.

   Score: [NA]

2. The eligibility criteria for this trial are relatively pragmatic, as they allow for a wide range of patients with relapsing forms of MS to participate, including those with an inadequate response to or inability to tolerate one or more therapies for MS. However, the exclusion criteria are quite extensive and specific, which may limit the generalizability of the trial results to a broader population. Additionally, the requirement for patients to be naïve to fingolimod treatment suggests a more explanatory approach. Overall, the eligibility criteria appear to be moderately pragmatic, with some elements of explanatory design. Score: [3]

12. The flexibility of this trial in terms of adherence appears to be moderately explanatory, as patients were required to have received a single iDMT continuously for at least 6 months prior to study initiation and to be candidates for therapy change, and to have been naïve to fingolimod treatment. These criteria suggest a more controlled and specific approach to adherence. Score: [2]

<pre>
1. Eligibility:

   Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;All participants were recruited among six MS rehabilitation centers within the region of Castilla y Le´on (Spain)&quot;</span> [...] <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot; After a medical evaluation that confirmed patients’ aptitude and absence of contraindications to carry out the procedures involved in the study, subjects signed a written informed consent form to participate.&quot;</span>

   Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants were randomly assigned to two different groups, the exercise group (EG) or the control group (CG). The EG, which included 16 women and 14 men (49.6 ± 11.0 yr), performed 12 weeks of resistance training followed by a detraining period where resistance exercise or other structured physical activity was avoided. The CG, which did not follow any resistance training during the study period, included 7 women and 5 men (46.2 ± 7.5 yr).&quot;</span>

   Reasoning: The eligibility criteria for this trial are similar to those used in usual care, with participants being recruited from MS rehabilitation centers and undergoing a medical evaluation to confirm their aptitude for the study. The random assignment of participants to either the exercise or control group also increases the pragmatism of the trial. However, the exclusion of participants with contraindications to the study procedures may limit the generalizability of the trial to a wider population of MS patients. Score: [4]

2. Recruitment:

   Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;After a group meeting where the details of the investigation were described to the patients, including possible risks and discomfort associated to the intervention, a formal invitation to take part in the study was offered.&quot;</span>

   Reasoning: The recruitment process for this trial is similar to that used in usual care, with patients being informed about the study and invited to participate. However, the use of a group meeting to provide information about the study may limit the pragmatism of the trial, as this approach may not be feasible in a usual care setting. Score: [3]

3. Setting:

   Quote: <span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 97.4%):

performed 12 weeks of resistance training followed by a detraining period where resistance exercise or other structured physical activity was avoided. The CG, which did not follow any resistance training during the study period,' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;The EG performed 12 weeks of resistance training followed by a detraining period where resistance exercise or other structured physical activity was avoided. The CG did not follow any resistance training during the study period.&quot;</span>

   Reasoning: The setting of this trial is similar to that used in usual care, with participants performing resistance training or not, depending on their group assignment. However, the use of a controlled research setting may limit the pragmatism of the trial, as it may not reflect the variability and unpredictability of a usual care setting. Score: [3]

4. Organization:

   Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;All testing procedures were selected according to previous studies&quot;</span> [...] <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot; Each participant completed the tests in a single session. Subjects were individually informed about the test procedures before initiating them.&quot;</span>

   Reasoning: The organization of this trial is similar to that used in usual care, with participants undergoing testing procedures that are selected based on previous studies. The individualized nature of the testing procedures also increases the pragmatism of the trial. However, the use of a controlled research setting may limit the generalizability of the trial to a wider population of MS patients. Score: [4]

5. Flexibility (delivery):

   Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Subjects performed coupled concentric-eccentric bilateral seated knee extension training using a weight stack machine&quot;</span> [...] <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot; The patients were continuously supervised by physical therapists.&quot;</span>

   Reasoning: The flexibility in the delivery of the intervention in this trial is similar to that used in usual care, with participants performing resistance training using a weight stack machine and being supervised by physical therapists. However, the use of a controlled research setting may limit the pragmatism of the trial, as it may not reflect the variability and unpredictability of a usual care setting. Score: [4]

6. Flexibility (adherence):

   Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Adherence to the training intervention (e.g. EG) averaged 22.9 ± 1.5 sessions from a total of 24 planned sessions&quot;</span> [...] <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot; All participants from the EG completed more than 75% of the sessions included in the resistance training program.&quot;</span>

   Reasoning: The flexibility in adherence to the intervention in this trial is similar to that used in usual care, with participants being encouraged to complete as many sessions as possible. The high adherence rate of the EG also increases the pragmatism of the trial. However, the use of a controlled research setting may limit the generalizability of the trial to a wider population of MS patients. Score: [4]

7. Follow-up:

   Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Testing was performed on three different occasions: before (week 0) and after (week 12) the training program, and after the detraining period (week 24).&quot;</span>

   Reasoning: The follow-up procedures in this trial are similar to those used in usual care, with participants undergoing testing at multiple time points. However, the use of a controlled research setting may limit the pragmatism of the trial, as it may not reflect the variability and unpredictability of a usual care setting. Score: [4]

8. Primary outcome:

   Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The EG increased MVIC and muscle power after the training period, although the training did not affect muscle endurance. After 12 weeks of detraining, MVIC returned to pre-training values but muscle power was still greater than pre-training values in the EG.&quot;</span>

   Reasoning: The primary outcome of this trial is relevant to participants, as it demonstrates the effects of resistance training and detraining on muscle strength and power in MS patients. However, the use of a controlled research setting may limit the pragmatism of the trial, as it may not reflect the variability and unpredictability of a usual care setting. Score: [4]

9. Primary analysis:

   Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Two-way ANOVA with repeated measurements for group and time&quot;</span> [...] <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot; Bonferroni post-hoc comparisons.&quot;</span>

   Reasoning: The primary analysis of this trial is similar to that used in usual care, with statistical tests being used to compare the effects of the intervention between groups and time points. However, the use of a controlled research setting may limit the pragmatism of the trial, as it may not reflect the variability and unpredictability of a usual care setting. Score: [4]

Score: [5]\n\n---\n\nFor each of the 9 domains of PRECIS-2, perform the following steps:\n1. Extract 1-3 relevant quotes from the full text.\n2. Explain your reasoning in 1 paragraph.\n3. Give a score X from 1 (very explanatory) to 5 (very pragmatic) in square brackets like this: 'Score: [X]'. If the full text does not contain enough information to assess a specific domain, report 'Score: [NA]'.\n\nDo not provide a final summary paragraph in the end.\n\n\n","\n1. Eligibility:\n   - 'Inclusion criteria were: 1) having a definite diagnosis of MS from a neurologist; 2) being within 5 years of receiving a diagnosis of MS; 3) scoring at least 10 on the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) [26]; 4) not currently undertaking other psychological treatment for depressive or anxiety symptoms for the length of participation in the current trial; 5) speak English fluently; 6) no current or lifetime diagnosis of psychosis; 7) no current substance dependency; 8) no gross cognitive impairment; and 9) no changes to medications prior and during in-volvement in the trial.'\n   - 'Two studies suggest that up to 36% of MS patients continue to have high levels of depressive and anxiety symptoms in the first two years after a diagnosis [11] and are at greater risk of suicide [17].'\n   - 'Individuals may also be adapting to the MS diagnosis and symptoms, the burden of uncertainty and dealing with the loss of physical and cognitive functioning, changes in interpersonal relationships, social and work roles and social support and a reduction in positively reinforcing activities.'\n\n   The inclusion criteria are relatively broad and inclusive, with the exception of the requirement for a BDI-II score of at least 10. This suggests that the trial is not overly selective in terms of participant eligibility, which is consistent with a pragmatic approach. However, the fact that participants are required to have a definite diagnosis of MS from a neurologist and to be within 5 years of receiving the diagnosis suggests that the trial is not completely unrestricted in terms of eligibility. The inclusion of individuals who are adapting to the MS diagnosis and symptoms, as well as those who are at greater risk of suicide, also suggests a more pragmatic approach. Overall, the eligibility domain appears to be relatively pragmatic, with a score of [4].\n\n2. Recruitment:\n   - 'Participants were recruited through neurologists working in a large MS outpatient clinic at the hospital, advertisements on MS related websites and local press releases.'\n   - 'Forty-seven people were approached and screened and took part in the study. 17 of the 47 screened were not eligible for the trial giving a participation rate of 64%.'\n\n   The recruitment process appears to be relatively pragmatic, with participants being recruited through neurologists, advertisements on MS related websites, and local press releases. The participation rate of 64% also suggests that the recruitment process was relatively successful. However, the fact that 17 out of 47 screened participants were not eligible for the trial suggests that there may have been some level of selection bias in the recruitment process. Overall, the recruitment domain appears to be relatively pragmatic, with a score of [4].\n\n3. Setting:\n   - 'The study took place at a large teaching and research hospital in Melbourne, Australia.'\n\n   The setting of the trial appears to be relatively pragmatic, as it took place at a large teaching and research hospital in Melbourne, Australia. This suggests that the setting of the trial is similar to the usual care setting, which is consistent with a pragmatic approach. However, the full text does not provide enough information to determine whether the setting of the trial is identical to the usual care setting. Overall, the setting domain appears to be relatively pragmatic, with a score of [4].\n\n4. Organization:\n   - 'All participants completed questionnaires at pre- and post-treatment and at 20 weeks follow up.'\n   - 'Participants were randomly assigned using a computer generated random numbers table using an allocation ratio of 1: 1 to 1 of the 2 treatment groups.'\n   - 'The assignment to the CBT intervention or TAU group schedule was locked away in a locked filing cabinet at the hospital.'\n   - 'Blinding of staff and participants after assignment to interventions was not maintained.'\n\n   The organization of the trial appears to be relatively pragmatic, as participants were randomly assigned to treatment groups using a computer generated random numbers table, and all participants completed questionnaires at pre- and post-treatment and at 20 weeks follow up. However, the fact that blinding of staff and participants after assignment to interventions was not maintained suggests that the trial may not be as pragmatic as it could be. Overall, the organization domain appears to be relatively pragmatic, with a score of [4].\n\n5. Flexibility (delivery):\n   - 'The tailored CBT intervention lends from Beck’s cognitive theoretical model for the treatment of depression in adults.'\n   - 'Participants were given homework to complete for each of the 8 sessions.'\n   - 'The CBT intervention consisted of 8 individual modules which focused on CBT based principles and strategies.'\n   - 'The intervention also focused on facilitating acceptance of MS illness and adjusting to living with MS and the final therapy session was dedicated to relapse prevention.'\n\n   The flexibility of the intervention appears to be relatively pragmatic, as participants were given homework to complete for each of the 8 sessions, and the intervention focused on CBT based principles and strategies. The fact that the intervention also focused on facilitating acceptance of MS illness and adjusting to living with MS suggests that the intervention was tailored to the needs of the participants, which is consistent with a pragmatic approach. However, the full text does not provide enough information to determine whether there was a strict protocol, monitoring, and measures to improve compliance, with specific advice on allowed co-interventions and complications. Overall, the flexibility (delivery) domain appears to be relatively pragmatic, with a score of [4].\n\n6. Flexibility (adherence):\n   - 'All sessions (apart from the first session which was 1.5 h) were 1 h in duration and took place in a clinic room at the hospital.'\n   - 'A senior clinical psychologist and a provisional clinical psychologist (supervised by the clinical psychologist) provided the intervention.'\n\n   The flexibility of adherence to the intervention appears to be relatively pragmatic, as all sessions were 1 h in duration and took place in a clinic room at the hospital. The fact that a senior clinical psychologist and a provisional clinical psychologist provided the intervention suggests that the intervention was delivered by experienced and qualified professionals, which is consistent with a pragmatic approach.

Follow-up:\n   - 'All participants completed the pre, post and 20 week follow up questionnaires.'\n\n   The intensity of measurement and follow-up of participants in the trial appears to be relatively pragmatic, as all participants completed the pre, post and 20 week follow up questionnaires. This suggests that the trial is not overly burdensome for participants, which is consistent with a pragmatic approach. However, the full text does not provide enough information to determine whether there were more frequent, longer visits, unscheduled visits triggered by primary outcome event or intervening event, and more extensive data collection. Overall, the follow-up domain appears to be relatively pragmatic, with a score of [4].\n\n8. Primary outcome:\n   - 'The primary outcome was level of depressive symptoms at post and 3 month follow up which was measured with the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) [26].'\n\n   The primary outcome of the trial appears to be relatively pragmatic, as it measured level of depressive symptoms at post and 3 month follow up using the BDI-II. This suggests that the primary outcome is relevant to participants, which is consistent with a pragmatic approach. However, the full text does not provide enough information to determine whether the trial used a surrogate, physiological outcome, central adjudication or use assessment expertise that is not available in usual care, or the outcome was measured at an earlier time than in usual care. Overall, the primary outcome domain appears to be relatively pragmatic, with a score of [4].\n\n9. Primary analysis:\n   - 'To examine group differences at post and 20 week follow up assessment, individual analyses of covariance (ANCOVAs) were performed with baseline treatment outcome scores used as the covariate.'\n\n   The primary analysis of the trial appears to be relatively pragmatic, as individual analyses of covariance (ANCOVAs) were performed with baseline treatment outcome scores used as the covariate. This suggests that all data were included in the analysis of the primary outcome, which is consistent with a pragmatic approach. However, the full text does not provide enough information to determine whether the analysis excluded ineligible post-randomisation participants, included only completers or those following the treatment protocol. Overall, the primary analysis domain appears to be relatively pragmatic, with a score of [4].\n\nIn summary, the PRECIS-2 domains of the trial appear to be relatively pragmatic, with scores ranging from [3] to [5]. The eligibility, recruitment, setting, organization, flexibility (delivery), flexibility (adherence), follow-up, primary outcome, and primary analysis domains all appear to be relatively pragmatic, with scores of [4] or higher. However, the full text does not provide enough information to determine the exact scores for some of the domains.

Score: [5]\n\n\n","\n1. Eligibility:\n   - 'Patients were required to have received a single iDMT (except natalizumab) continuously for at least 6 months prior to study initiation and to be candidates for therapy change.' [1]\n   - 'Patients were required to have been naïve to fingolimod treatment.' [1]\n   - 'Patients were excluded from the study for any of the following reasons: chronic immune system disease other than MS; immunodeficiency; malignancy other than localized basal cell carcinoma within the past 5 years; a history of cardiac arrest, myocardial infarction, ischemic heart disease or coronary spasm within the past 6 months; Mobitz type II second-degree heart block, third-degree atrioventricular block or an increased corrected QT (QTc) interval (>470 ms); having undergone a bone marrow transplant; a history of alcohol abuse within the past 5 years.' [1]\n   - 'Further exclusion criteria at the time of screening were: macular edema; active systemic infection; a negative test for Varicella zoster immunoglobulin G antibodies; positive tests for hepatitis B, hepatitis C or human immunodeficiency virus; tuberculosis; uncontrolled diabetes; uncontrolled or poorly controlled hypertension or asthma; cardiac failure; severe respiratory disease or pulmonary fibrosis; chronic liver or biliary disease.' [1]\n\n2. The eligibility criteria for this trial are relatively pragmatic, as they allow for a wide range of patients with relapsing forms of MS to participate, including those with an inadequate response to or inability to tolerate one or more therapies for MS. However, the exclusion criteria are quite extensive and specific, which may limit the generalizability of the trial results to a broader population. Additionally, the requirement for patients to be naïve to fingolimod treatment suggests a more explanatory approach. Overall, the eligibility criteria appear to strike a balance between pragmatism and explanatory rigor, with a slight lean towards the latter. Score: [3]\n\n3. Recruitment:\n   - 'Study enrollment was completed in October 2011. Of 1053 patients randomized to treatment, 790 were randomized to fingolimod 0.5 mg and 263 were randomized to an iDMT.' [1]\n   - 'Patients randomized to the iDMT group either remained on the same therapy or, following consultation with a physician, were switched immediately to another approved iDMT.' [1]\n\n4. The recruitment process for this trial appears to be relatively pragmatic, as it involves recruiting patients from both the USA and Canada, and randomizing them to either fingolimod or an iDMT without any intervening washout period. The fact that patients were allowed to switch immediately to another approved iDMT suggests a more pragmatic approach. However, the specific inclusion and exclusion criteria may have influenced the types of patients who were recruited, potentially limiting the generalizability of the trial results. Overall, the recruitment process appears to be relatively pragmatic, with a score of [4].\n\n5. Setting:\n   - 'EPOC was a 6-month, randomized, open-label, multicenter, phase 4 study conducted in the USA and Canada.' [1]\n\n6. The setting of this trial appears to be relatively pragmatic, as it involves conducting the study in both the USA and Canada, and in multiple centers. This approach allows for a more diverse patient population and a greater generalizability of the trial results. However, the fact that the study is open-label may introduce some bias and reduce the pragmatism of the setting. Overall, the setting of the trial appears to be relatively pragmatic, with a score of [4].\n\n7.

You are an expert in clinical trial design and are tasked to assess the PRECIS-2 scores of a trial based on the full text of its publication. You have the following briefing:

# PRECIS-2 Domains
* Eligibility: To what extent are the participants in the trial similar to those who would receive this intervention if it was part of usual care? For example, score 5 for very pragmatic criteria essentially identical to those in usual care; score 1 for a very explanatory approach with lots of exclusions (e.g. those who don’t comply, respond to treatment, or are not at high risk for primary outcome, are children or elderly), or uses many selection tests not used in usual care.
* Recruitment: How much extra effort is made to recruit participants over and above what that would be used in the usual care setting to engage with patients? For example, score 5 for very pragmatic recruitment through usual appointments or clinic; score 1 for a very explanatory approach with targeted invitation letters, advertising in newspapers, radio plus incentives and other routes that would not be used in usual care.
* Setting: How different is the setting of the trial and the usual care setting? For example, score 5 for a very pragmatic choice using identical settings to usual care; score 1, for a very explanatory approach with only a single centre, or only specialised trial or academic centres.
* Organisation: How different are the resources, provider expertise and the organisation of care delivery in the intervention arm of the trial and those available in usual care? For example, score 5 for a very pragmatic choice that uses identical organisation to usual care; score 1 for a very explanatory approach if the trial increases staff levels, gives additional training, require more than usual experience or certification and increase resources.
* Flexibility (delivery): How different is the flexibility in how the intervention is delivered and the flexibility likely in usual care? For example, score 5 for a very pragmatic choice with identical flexibility to usual care; score 1 for a very explanatory approach if there is a strict protocol, monitoring and measures to improve compliance, with specific advice on allowed co-interventions and complications.
* Flexibility (adherence): How different is the flexibility in how participants must adhere to the intervention and the flexibility likely in usual care? For example, score 5 for a very pragmatic choice involving no more than usual encouragement to adhere to the intervention; score 1 for a very explanatory approach that involves exclusion based on adherence, and measures to improve adherence if found wanting. In some trials eg surgical trials where patients are being operated on or Intensive Care Unit trials where patients are being given IV drug therapy, this domain is not applicable as there is no compliance issue after consent has been given, so this score should be left blank.
* Follow-up: How different is the intensity of measurement and follow-up of participants in the trial and the likely follow-up in usual care? For example, score 5 for a very pragmatic approach with no more than usual follow up; score 1 for a very explanatory approach with more frequent, longer visits, unscheduled visits triggered by primary outcome event or intervening event, and more extensive data collection.
* Primary outcome: To what extent is the trial's primary outcome relevant to participants? For example, score 5 for a very pragmatic choice where the outcome is of obvious importance to participants; score 1 for a very explanatory approach using a surrogate, physiological outcome, central adjudication or use assessment expertise that is not available in usual care, or the outcome is measured at an earlier time than in usual care.
* Primary analysis: To what extent are all data included in the analysis of the primary outcome? For example, score 5 for a very pragmatic approach using intention to treat with all available data; score 1 for a very explanatory analysis that excludes ineligible post-randomisation participants, includes only completers or those following the treatment protocol.

For each of the 9 domains of PRECIS-2, perform the following steps:
1. Extract 1-3 relevant quotes from the full text.
2. Explain your reasoning in 1 paragraph.
3. Give a score X from 1 (very explanatory) to 5 (very pragmatic) in square brackets like this: "Score: [X]". If the full text does not contain enough information to assess a specific domain, report "Score: [NA]".

Do not provide a final summary paragraph in the end.
