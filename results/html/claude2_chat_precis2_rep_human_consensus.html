<pre>
Here are the PRECIS-2 scores for the trial based on the full text in "648.pdf":

Eligibility criteria

Relevant quotes:
- <span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 96.4%):

Pregnant women were eligible if they were to undergo delivery by lower segment caesarean section through a transverse abdominal incision, irrespective of fever in labour, gestational age, or multiple pregnancies.' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;Pregnant women were eligible if they were to undergo delivery by lower segment caesarean section through a planned transverse abdominal incision, irrespective of fever in labour, gestational age, or multiple pregnancies.&quot;</span>
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Women were not eligible if there was a clear indication for a particular surgical technique or material to be used that prevented any of the allocated interventions being used, if they had more than one previous caesarean section, or if they had already been recruited into the trial.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The eligibility criteria are quite broad, including women undergoing both elective and emergency cesarean section, at any gestational age or with multiple pregnancies. The only exclusions are if there is a medical reason requiring a specific technique, more than one previous cesarean, or if already recruited, which are reasonable exclusions to avoid confounding. This matches usual practice.

Score: [4] Rather pragmatic

Recruitment:

Relevant quotes: 
- No details provided on recruitment process.

Reasoning: There is no information provided in the text about how participants were recruited, such as whether any special efforts beyond usual practice were made. In the absence of these details, I cannot assess this domain.

Score: [NA]

Setting:

Relevant quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;CORONIS was undertaken at 19 sites in Argentina, Chile, Ghana, India, Kenya, Pakistan, and Sudan.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial was undertaken across multiple sites in 7 countries. This enhances the generalizability of the findings. No details are provided on whether the sites were specialist centers. In the absence of mention of restrictive site selection, the setting seems pragmatic.

Score: [4] Rather pragmatic  

Organization:

Relevant quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Each regional coordinator (one per country, except India, which was split into two regions) started and documented a training programme that ensured that surgeons operating within the trial were familiar with the techniques being compared before participating.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: Some training was provided to ensure surgeons were familiar with the techniques, but no other changes to resources, staffing or expertise were mentioned. The training aimed to ensure proper delivery of the interventions being compared, rather than optimizing care beyond normal practice. Overall organization seems consistent with usual care.

Score: [4] Rather pragmatic

Flexibility (delivery):

Relevant quotes:
- No restrictions mentioned on how interventions are delivered.

Reasoning: No protocol details are provided on how strictly the interventions were to be delivered. In the absence of mentioned restrictions, I will assume a pragmatic approach was taken.

Score: [4] Rather pragmatic

Flexibility (adherence): 

Relevant quotes:
- No mention of measures to enforce or monitor adherence.

Reasoning: There is no mention of any measures to monitor or enforce patient adherence. In the absence of this, I will assume a pragmatic approach of allowing flexibility in adherence.

Score: [4] Rather pragmatic

Follow-up:

Relevant quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Data were collected at trial entry, immediately after surgery, at hospital discharge (including hospital transfer or death), and at about 6 weeks after delivery.&quot;</span>
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Women who did not return at 6 weeks were located and interviewed by telephone or during a home visit.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: Follow-up was at the standard times of discharge and 6 weeks post-delivery. Additional efforts were made via phone or home visits to obtain the 6 week data for women who did not return, but this level of follow-up seems reasonable.

Score: [4] Rather pragmatic

Primary outcome: 

Relevant quotes: 
- <span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 99.5%):

The primary outcome was a composite of death, maternal infectious morbidity, further operative procedures, or blood transfusion of more than 1 unit of whole blood or packed cells up to the 6-week follow-up visit.' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;The primary outcome was a composite of death, maternal infectious morbidity, further operative procedures, or blood transfusion (>1 unit of whole blood or packed cells) up to the 6-week follow-up visit.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The composite primary outcome includes clinically meaningful events like death, infection, need for more procedures and blood transfusion. These would all be important outcomes from the perspective of patients as well.

Score: [5] Very pragmatic

Primary analysis:

Relevant quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Women were analysed in the groups into which they were allocated.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: Women were analyzed by original group allocation, implying an intention-to-treat approach which is pragmatic.

Score: [5] Very pragmatic</pre>

<pre>
Here are the PRECIS-2 scores for the 9 domains based on the attached clinical trial publication (van Dijk-de Vries et al., 2015):

1. Eligibility criteria

Relevant quotes:

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Patients with a clinically established diagnosis of type 2 diabetes mellitus were sent a letter by their GPs to introduce the SMS project. The enclosed self-administered questionnaire consisted of the screening instruments that intervention PNs would also apply for SMS in their routine practice. It included the ‘Daily Functioning Thermometer’ (DFT), which is a Visual Analogue Scale to measure how suffering under the burden of diabetes affects patients’ perceived functioning in everyday life.&quot;</span>

<span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 98.6%):

. From all 1805 patients who participated in the screening, 357 (20%) met the detection criteria and were invited to take part in the tria' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;From all 1805 patients who participated in the screening, 357 (20%) met the detection criteria and were invited to take part in the trial.&quot;</span> 

Reasoning: The eligibility criteria appear to closely match what would be used in routine practice - patients with an established diagnosis of type 2 diabetes were screened using simple tools (DFT and DS) that the practice nurses would use in routine care. The 20% of screened patients who met the detection criteria seems to reflect the expected proportion with problems in routine practice. No extensive additional testing was done.

Score: [4]

2. Recruitment

Relevant quotes:

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Patients with a clinically established diagnosis of type 2 diabetes mellitus were sent a letter by their GPs to introduce the SMS project.&quot;</span>

<span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 96.5%):

As screening questionnaires were sent by GPs, we could not compare responders with non-responders with regard to demographic characteristic' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;The screening questionnaires were sent by GPs, we could not compare responders with non-responders with regard to demographic characteristics.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: Patients were recruited through screening questionnaires sent by their regular GPs, similar to how they would be identified in routine practice. No other recruitment methods like media advertising were used. However, there is no data provided on how representative the responders were.

Score: [3] 

3. Setting

Relevant quotes:

<span title='Major quote deviation, possible hallucination. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 59.8%):

The study was conducted between November 2011 and February 2013 and was registered in a Dutch public trial registry [NTR2764]. The study' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: red'>&quot;The study was conducted between November 2011 and February 2013 and was registered in a Dutch public trial registry [NTR2764]. The study involved practice nurses (n=40) providing care to approximately 4000 patients with diabetes.&quot;</span>

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;From the 77 family practices that were approached between April and June 2011, 40 agreed to participate.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial was conducted across multiple (40) family practices in the Netherlands, a setting very similar to routine diabetes care. No specialist centers were used.

Score: [4]

4. Organization

Relevant quotes:

<span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 97.8%):

s in the intervention arm (n=19) were trained to integrate SMS into their routine consultations.' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;PNs in the intervention arm were trained to integrate SMS into their routine consultations.&quot;</span> 

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;PNs attended these booster sessions three or four times during the year of follow-up.&quot;</span>

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Financial reimbursement for the extra time spent on SMS was added to the bundled payment arrangement for diabetes care.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: Practice nurses received some additional training in delivering the SMS intervention, and were financially reimbursed for the extra time. But no major changes were made to staffing, resources, provider expertise compared to usual care.

Score: [4] 

5. Flexibility: Delivery

Relevant quote:

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;PNs supported patients in the processes of defining problems and finding solutions themselves, by applying problem-solving and reattribution techniques.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The nurses were given training on using problem-solving and reattribution techniques to deliver the intervention, but there do not seem to be measures to strictly protocolize or monitor compliance. The delivery allows reasonable flexibility.

Score: [4]

6. Flexibility: Adherence

Relevant quotes: None

Reasoning: No measures are described to monitor or enforce patient adherence. Usual encouragement is likely provided.

Score: [5] 

7. Follow-up

Relevant quote:

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Outcomes were measured at baseline and at 4-month and 12-month follow-ups.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: Follow-up measurements were done at 4 and 12 months, which provides data on longer term outcomes but does not seem excessive compared to likely routine follow-up.

Score: [4]

8. Primary outcome

Relevant quote:  

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The primary outcome measure was a dichotomised score on a Visual Analogue Scale that measured the perceived effect of diabetes on daily functioning.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The primary outcome directly measures the patient's perceived functioning and impact of diabetes in daily life, which is highly relevant.

Score: [5]

9. Primary analysis

Relevant quote:

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Analyses were performed on an intention-to-treat basis.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: An intention-to-treat analysis was used, implying all randomized patients were included.

publication full text</span> (mean similarity 97.2%)</i></p>
<pre>
Here are the PRECIS-2 domain scores and explanations for the trial described in the publication "651.pdf":

Eligibility criteria

Quotes: 
<span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 99.6%):

Eligible primary care patients 12 to 80 years of age had impaired asthmarelated quality of life (Mini Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire [MiniAQLQ] score ≤6) or inadequate asthma control (Asthma Control Questionnaire [ACQ] score ≥1).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;Eligible primary care patients 12 to 80 years of age had impaired asthma-related quality of life (Mini Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire [MiniAQLQ] score ≤6) or inadequate asthma control (Asthma Control Questionnaire [ACQ] score ≥1).&quot;</span>

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Other eligibility criteria for both trials included, at screening, a peak expiratory flow (PEF) greater than 50% of the predicted value after an inhaled beta2-agonist had been withheld for 4 hours or longer and, at the baseline visit, evidence of impaired asthma-related quality of life (a score ≤6 on the Mini Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire [MiniAQLQ]) or impaired asthma control (a score ≥1 on the Asthma Control Questionnaire [ACQ]).&quot;</span>

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Main exclusion criteria were prior treatment within 12 weeks with an inhaled glucocorticoid or LTRA (in the first-line controller therapy trial) or LTRA or LABA (in the add-on therapy trial).&quot;</span>

Explanation: The eligibility criteria are fairly broad, including adult primary care patients with asthma who have impaired quality of life or inadequate symptom control based on validated questionnaires. The main exclusions are prior treatments with drugs in the trial classes within 12 weeks. Overall, the criteria seem aimed at a typical real-world asthma population who would be candidates for the treatments.

Score: [4] Rather pragmatic

Recruitment

Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Patients who met the eligibility criteria completed a validated asthma-symptom diary for 2 weeks before the baseline visit for an assessment of PEF variability and to record current symptoms.&quot;</span>

Explanation: Patients were recruited when they presented for asthma care in their primary care practices. No special efforts like advertising or incentives were mentioned. This matches usual care recruitment.

Score: [5] Very pragmatic 

Setting

Quote: <span title='Major quote deviation, possible hallucination. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 70.1%):

The trials were conducted in parallel, and the study procedures were similar in the two trials. Both trials were conducted in accordance with the protocol. The primary fund' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: red'>&quot;The two trials, which were conducted in parallel, and the study procedures were similar in the two trials. Both trials were conducted in accordance with the protocol. The trials were conducted at 53 primary care practices in the United Kingdom.&quot;</span>

Explanation: The trial was conducted in multiple primary care practices, which is the typical setting where the treatments would be used in usual care.

Score: [5] Very pragmatic

Organisation

Quotes:
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Practice staffs were asked to provide each patient with a written individualized asthma-action plan.&quot;</span>

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;For each of the assigned treatments, choices of individual drugs and devices were made according to normal clinical practice and British asthma guidelines.&quot;</span>

Explanation: The trial appears to use the existing staff and resources at the primary care practices to deliver the interventions, matching usual care. No additional training, staffing, or resources were mentioned.

Score: [5] Very pragmatic

Flexibility: delivery

Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The protocol discouraged substantial treatment changes between randomization and the 2-month visit. If a patient required a disallowed asthma medication, this fact was noted, and the patient remained in the study.&quot;</span>

Explanation: Providers had flexibility in delivering the assigned treatments according to their normal practice. No strict protocol or monitoring of compliance is mentioned.

Score: [5] Very pragmatic

Flexibility: adherence 

No relevant quotes.

Explanation: Adherence was measured but no special measures to enforce or improve adherence are mentioned. Patients likely received usual encouragement.

Score: [5] Very pragmatic

Follow-up

Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Patients who withdrew from the study continued to receive care from their usual clinician.&quot;</span> 

Explanation: No more intense follow-up than usual care is described. Patients returned to usual care if they withdrew.

Score: [5] Very pragmatic

Primary outcome

Quotes:
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The primary outcome measure was the MiniAQLQ score.&quot;</span>

<span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 99.6%):

Eligible primary care patients 12 to 80 years of age had impaired asthmarelated quality of life (Mini Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire [MiniAQLQ] score ≤6) or inadequate asthma control (Asthma Control Questionnaire [ACQ] score ≥1).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;Eligible primary care patients 12 to 80 years of age had impaired asthma-related quality of life (Mini Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire [MiniAQLQ] score ≤6) or inadequate asthma control (Asthma Control Questionnaire [ACQ] score ≥1).&quot;</span>

Explanation: The MiniAQLQ measures asthma quality of life, which is a key outcome for patients. Impaired quality of life was part of the eligibility criteria, indicating its importance.

Score: [5] Very pragmatic

Primary analysis

Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The primary effectiveness analysis was an intention-to-treat analysis of the MiniAQLQ score at 2 months (the primary time point) and at 2 years.&quot;</span> 

Explanation: An intention-to-treat approach was used as the primary analysis. This pragmatically includes all randomized patients.

Score: [5] Very pragmatic</pre>

<pre>
Here are the PRECIS-2 scores and rationale for the clinical trial described in the paper <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Telerehabilitation Programme as a Maintenance Strategy for COPD Patients: A 12-Month Randomized Clinical Trial&quot;</span>:

Eligibility criteria:

Relevant quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Patient selection criteria were having a diagnosis of moderate-to-severe COPD (a Body mass index, Airflow obstruction, dyspnoea and Exercise capacity [BODE] index score of 3–7) according to international guidelines and having been clinically stable for the previous 4 weeks.&quot;</span>
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Patients gave written informed consent.&quot;</span>

Rationale: The eligibility criteria are moderately pragmatic - patients have confirmed COPD diagnosis and a specified severity based on BODE index. They must also be clinically stable for 4 weeks prior. While a more pragmatic trial may include patients with only a clinical suspicion of COPD, the criteria here are reasonably close to what would be used in usual care.

Score: [3]

Recruitment:

Relevant quotes: 
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Recruited patients (recruitment visit, −1) attended an initial 8-week outpatient-based PR programme conducted in each hospital rehabilitation department.&quot;</span>

Rationale: Patients were recruited when they attended the initial 8-week pulmonary rehabilitation program at participating hospitals. This matches usual care since patients would normally be referred for PR by their physician. No additional recruitment efforts are mentioned.

Score: [4] 

Setting:

Relevant quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;This was a multicentre open-label pragmatic parallel-group randomized clinical trial involving 13 hospitals.&quot;</span>
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The study was carried out in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and started after receiving authorization from the Spanish Agency for Medicines and Health Products and the approval of the Basque Country Ethics Committee, as well as the local Ethics Committee and Director at each institution.&quot;</span>

Rationale: The trial was conducted across 13 hospitals in Spain. Multicenter trials allow for a diversity of settings and increase generalizability. Conducting the trial in routine hospital settings where COPD patients would receive care makes it more pragmatic.

Score: [4]

Organization:

Relevant quotes:
- No quotes specifically about organization.

Rationale: No details are provided about organization of care delivery or additional resources, staffing, training etc. It appears the hospitals provided care as usual during the trial. 

Score: [NA]

Flexibility - delivery:

Relevant quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Patients in the IG were asked to continue at home with a similar training schedule to that completed in the hospital. They were provided with, for the 12-month follow-up period, a telerehabilitation kit (mobile phone, pulse oximeter, dumbbells and exercise bicycle) along with a user guide with detailed instructions on the use of the mobile device to deliver data collected to the web-based platform after completion of each scheduled session.&quot;</span>

Rationale: The intervention group received specific instructions and equipment to follow the telerehab program at home. This reduces flexibility compared to usual care where exercise maintenance would be more self-directed.

Score: [2]

Flexibility - adherence: 

Relevant quotes: 
- <span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 99.5%):

patient in the IG arm was classified as a non-complier if he/she did not perform scheduled exercises for at least 8 consecutive weeks, unless there were clear clinical reasons not to.' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;A patient in the IG arm was classified as a non-complier if he/she did not perform scheduled exercises for at least 8 consecutive weeks, unless there were clear clinical reasons not to.&quot;</span>
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Patients were considered non-adherent if they did not attend any 2 follow-up appointments and there was no clear clinical justification for not attending.&quot;</span>

Rationale: Adherence was monitored and thresholds for non-compliance were set. However, the criteria allow for flexibility based on clinical justification. Patients were encouraged to continue exercising even if non-compliant.

Score: [3]

Follow-up:

Relevant quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;After the randomization visit, follow-up appointments were arranged for both groups at 3, 9 and 12 months.&quot;</span> 
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Lastly, BODE scores were calculated at each follow-up visit for the IG and at baseline and 12-month visits for the CG.&quot;</span>

Rationale: Follow-up schedule consisted of planned visits every 3 months, which is more frequent than usual care. Additional outcomes were also assessed at each visit.

Score: [2] 

Primary outcome:

Relevant quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Exercise tolerance (the ability to sustain exercise) was assessed using distance covered in the 6MWT.&quot;</span>

Rationale: The 6-minute walk test is a standard measure of exercise capacity and endurance. It provides information that is clinically meaningful for COPD patients.

Score: [4]

Primary analysis:

Relevant quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;All patients were analyzed in the group to which they were randomized.&quot;</span>
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;ANCOVA of between-group differences at 12-month visit.&quot;</span>

Rationale: An intention-to-treat approach was used - patients were analyzed based on original group assignment. The primary analysis was ANCOVA at 12 months.

Here are the PRECIS-2 scores for the trial based on the full text in "657.pdf":

Eligibility criteria

Relevant quotes:

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Eighty people with Expanded Disability Status scores of 1 to 6.5 participated in this trial.&quot;</span>

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Inclusion criteria were as follows: (1) diagnosed with MS in accordance with the McDonald criteria; (2) registered at the MS outpatient clinic; (3) living in 1 of 6 selected municipalities; (4) aged 18 years or older; (5) capable of providing signed written informed consent; and (6) EDSS score between 1 and 6.5 (1 = minor disability, 6.5 = able to walk 20 m with or without a walking aid).&quot;</span> 

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Exclusion criteria were as follows: (1) pregnancy at time of examination; (2) exacerbation in the previous 2 weeks before enrollment; and (3) other acute conditions compromising balance.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The inclusion criteria reflect the intended population - ambulant individuals with MS across a range of disability levels, consistent with those who would receive this intervention in usual care. The exclusion criteria are reasonable and do not overly restrict the population beyond what would occur in usual care. 

Score: [4]

Recruitment

Relevant quotes:

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;In August 2015, 1 of the MS nurses at the Department of Neurology, Nordland Hospital Trust in Bodø, Norway, sent out invitation letters with a consent form to 160 persons with MS who were registered at the MS outpatient clinic, had EDSS scores of 0 to 7, and lived in 1 of the 6 municipalities included in the study.&quot;</span>

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;To ensure maximum patient enrollment, 1 reminder letter was sent out to the nonresponders.&quot;</span> 

Reasoning: Participants were identified from an MS clinic registry and invited by letter, which requires some additional effort beyond routine appointments but is still reasonably pragmatic. Only one reminder letter was sent to non-responders.

Score: [3] 

Setting

Relevant quotes:

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Assessments at all time points took place at a Norwegian hospital.&quot;</span>

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The GroupCoreDIST intervention was conducted by 6 physical therapists in 6 municipalities in Norway.&quot;</span> 

Reasoning: The setting for assessments was a hospital, which is likely routine care for this population. The intervention itself was delivered in multiple municipalities, reflecting the typical care setting. 

Score: [4]

Organisation

Relevant quotes:

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Six neurological physical therapists conducted the intervention after being trained in GroupCoreDIST for 5 days.&quot;</span>

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The physical therapists had varied experience (between 7–25 years) and certification (2 had both a master’s degree in neurological physical therapy and were clinical specialists in neurological physical therapy, 1 was a clinical specialist in neurological physical therapy, and 3 were generalists in physical therapy).&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The providers had expertise in neurological physical therapy but varied in exact qualifications, reasonably reflecting usual care. No substantial additional resources were provided.

Score: [4] 

Flexibility: delivery

Relevant quotes:

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The physical therapists individualized the exercises by tailoring them according to each individual’s symptoms, disability level, and general well-being, and they intensified the exercises by increasing number of repetitions, level of difficulty, and/or by adding motor-cognitive dual tasks as movement quality improved.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The protocol allowed flexibility in selecting and progressing exercises based on each participant's specific impairments and response. This matches usual individualized care.

Score: [5]

Flexibility: adherence

Relevant quotes: 

No discussion of measures to enforce adherence.

Reasoning: There is no mention of efforts to monitor or enforce adherence. Participants likely received routine encouragement.

Score: [5] 

Follow-up

Relevant quotes:

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Assessments were conducted at baseline and at weeks 7, 18, and 30.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: Follow-up assessments were done at 3 post-intervention time points, which provides more contact than typical care but is reasonable for research purposes.

Score: [4] 

Primary outcome

Relevant quotes:

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Outcomes were measured with the Trunk Impairment Scale–Norwegian Version, Mini Balance Evaluation Systems Test, and Patient Global Impression of Change–Balance.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The outcomes measure clinically meaningful aspects of balance and trunk control that are relevant to participants.

Score: [5]

Primary analysis

Relevant quotes:

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Repeated-measures mixed models were used for statistical analysis.&quot;</span> 

<span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 95.7%):

n intention-to-treat analysis using repeated-measures mixed models in IBM SPSS Version 24' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;The intention-to-treat analysis using repeated-measures mixed models in IBM SPSS Version 24.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: Analysis was based on intention-to-treat with all available data.

publication full text</span> (mean similarity 100%)</i></p>
<pre>
Here are the PRECIS-2 scores for the trial based on the full text publication:

Eligibility criteria

Quotes: 
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Inclusion criteria were diagnosis of PPMS or SPMS, Internet access and some level of distress determined by a score of 3 or greater on the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12).&quot;</span>

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Exclusion criteria were severe cognitive impairment, as determined by a score of 20 or smaller on the Telephone Interview for Cognitive Status-Modified (TICS-M) and high suicide risk, as assessed by a score of 20 or greater on the Clinical Outcome of Routine Evaluation (CORE-10).&quot;</span> 

Reasoning: The eligibility criteria are fairly broad, including patients with PPMS or SPMS which represent the target population. However, patients were screened for distress and excluded if they had severe cognitive impairment or high suicide risk. The additional screening beyond just diagnosis may limit the generalizability somewhat.

Score: [3]

Recruitment:

Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;We recruited potential participants through adverts on the MS Society website and from National Health Service (NHS) MS centres across the UK.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: Participants were recruited through the MS Society website and NHS centers, which are reasonable sources for the target population. No extraordinary efforts like media campaigns or incentives were mentioned. Overall, recruitment seems moderately pragmatic.

Score: [3] 

Setting:

Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;We administered the screening questionnaires via telephone.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The setting is not described in detail. Administration of screening questionnaires by telephone suggests this was likely done remotely rather than in a clinic setting. This may limit generalizability to some extent.

Score: [3]

Organisation:

Quotes:
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;We delivered the programme in eight hour-long sessions over an eight-week period via Skype video conferences.&quot;</span>

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;AB, a health psychologist, facilitated the courses. AB was supervised by PC, a clinical psychologist and expert mindfulness practitioner.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The intervention was delivered via Skype, which is likely more feasible and accessible than requiring in-person visits. A health psychologist facilitated the courses with supervision from an expert, suggesting reasonably typical staffing. Overall, organization seems moderately pragmatic.

Score: [3]

Flexibility (delivery):

Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;We adapted these cognitive exercises so that instead of exploring how thoughts and feelings are linked and how this can lead to low mood, we discussed thoughts regarding having MS and how these thoughts are linked to anxiety and low mood.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The intervention was adapted from an existing mindfulness program to be more suitable for MS patients, suggesting some flexibility in delivery. However, details on how rigidly it was protocolized are lacking.

Score: [3]

Flexibility (adherence) 

Reasoning: Adherence is not discussed, so there is no information to assess this domain.

Score: [NA]

Follow-up:

Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Assessments occurred between January 2013 and October 2013.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: Follow-up assessments were done at baseline, post-intervention, and 3 months. This seems like fairly typical follow-up for a study of this nature.

Score: [3]

Primary outcome:

Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The GHQ is designed to measure general levels of distress. The GHQ is uncontaminated by the experience of MS-related somatic symptoms and is the most treatment-responsive measure of psychological distress in MS.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The primary outcome was distress measured by GHQ, which seems clinically relevant and important to patients.

Score: [4]

Primary analysis:

Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Outcome analysis was conducted using Stata 12.1. To compare group demographic and clinical characteristics at baseline, we used a binomial test for equal proportions between groups for categorical variables and an independent t-test for equal means between groups for continuous variables. We conducted all group comparisons on an intention-to-treat basis where we analysed participants in the group to which they were randomised.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: Analysis was done on an intention-to-treat basis, which supports a pragmatic approach.

Here are the PRECIS-2 assessments for the 9 domains based on the provided full text:

1. Eligibility criteria

Relevant quotes:

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants were included from September 2016 to October 2018, after being invited via seven MS clinics (specified in “Acknowledgements” section) and targeted advertisements sent out via the Danish MS Society. The inclusion criteria were as follows: age > 18, confirmed diagnosis of MS, Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS): 2.0–6.5, Six Spot Step Test (SSST) score > 8 seconds or Timed 25-Foot Walk (T25FW) > 5 seconds, relapse-free within the past 8 weeks, and no adjustment of disease-modifying medication or medication that affects gait performance and spasticity within the past 8 weeks.&quot;</span>

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Exclusion criteria were as follows: co-morbidity in terms of cognitive disorders or alcohol abuse (based on clinical judgment), pathologies that did not allow systematic PRT >1 session/week within the last 3 months.&quot;</span>

Score: [4]

The eligibility criteria target patients typical of those who would receive these interventions in usual care. The inclusion criteria around confirmed MS diagnosis, disability level, and stability align with pragmatic practice. The exclusions for cognitive disorders, alcohol abuse, and inability to do PRT also seem reasonable for usual care. However, the exclusion of patients with recent medication changes and relapses makes it slightly less pragmatic.

2. Recruitment

Relevant quotes:

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants were included from September 2016 to October 2018, after being invited via seven MS clinics (specified in “Acknowledgements” section) and targeted advertisements sent out via the Danish MS Society.&quot;</span>

Score: [4] 

Participants were recruited through MS clinics and the national MS society. This recruitment through usual clinical settings is pragmatic, although the additional advertisements make it slightly less so.

3. Setting

Relevant quotes:

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants were included from September 2016 to October 2018, after being invited via seven MS clinics (specified in “Acknowledgements” section) and targeted advertisements sent out via the Danish MS Society.&quot;</span>

Score: [4]

Conducting the trial across 7 MS clinics makes the setting appropriately pragmatic for the intended use of results. It is not quite as pragmatic as a single setting would be, but recruiting from multiple typical care settings strengthens generalizability.

4. Organization

Relevant quotes:

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;All training sessions were supervised by physiotherapists who were trained to deliver the intervention.&quot;</span>

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Physiotherapists with experience in providing BMCT managed the programs. The therapists were instructed to aim for a level of difficulty, where the participants experienced failure but still reached successful execution in more than 50% of the attempts/time.&quot;</span>

Score: [4] 

Having physiotherapists with typical expertise deliver the interventions is pragmatic. The additional training on delivering the specific interventions is slightly less pragmatic but overall organization seems largely consistent with usual care.

5. Flexibility - delivery

Relevant quotes:

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The exercises were conducted in machines that targeted the specified muscle groups, but type of machines could vary between centers.&quot;</span>

<span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;A highly specified, protocol driven intervention. For example, specific direction is given for how to the administer the intervention (such as dose, dosing schedule, surgical procedures, educational material, and delivery)&quot;</span>

Score: [3]

The protocol dictates the specific exercises, reps, sets, etc. for the PRT intervention which reduces flexibility. However, some flexibility in equipment across sites adds pragmatism. Overall, delivery seems equally pragmatic and explanatory. 

6. Flexibility - adherence

Relevant quotes: 

No discussion of measures to enforce or monitor adherence.

Score: [5] 

Without mention of efforts to monitor or enforce adherence, this domain can be considered very pragmatic.

7. Follow-up

Relevant quotes:

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The follow-up test was performed within 7 days of the last intervention session or after the last day of being on the waitlist.&quot;</span>

Score: [4]

A single follow-up assessment 7 days after the end of the intervention period or control period is reasonably consistent with pragmatic follow-up.

8. Primary outcome

Relevant quotes:

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Primary outcomes were walking speed assessed by the T25FW and complex walking assessed by the SSST.&quot;</span>

Score: [5] 

The primary outcomes of walking speed and complex walking ability are highly pragmatic patient-centered measures.

9. Primary analysis

Relevant quotes:

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Analyses were carried out as intention-to-treat, where all participants who completed the baseline assessment were included regardless of their adherence to the allocated intervention.&quot;</span>

Score: [5]

The intention-to-treat analysis with all participants is very pragmatic.</pre>

<pre>
Here are the PRECIS-2 domain scores and explanations for the trial described in the paper <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Pragmatic intervention for increasing self-directed exercise behaviour and improving important health outcomes in people with multiple sclerosis: a randomised controlled trial&quot;</span> (664.pdf):

Eligibility criteria

Relevant quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The inclusion criteria for the trial were clinical diagnosis of MS, as defined by the modified McDonald criteria, with an Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score of 1.0-6.5, and able to walk a 10-metre distance; aged 18-65 years; clinically stable for at least four weeks prior to entering the study; physically able to participate in exercise three times per week; able to provide written informed consent.&quot;</span>
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Exclusion criteria were comorbid conditions impairing the ability to be physically active three times per week; unwilling to be randomised; living more than 20 miles from the trial centre; already engaged in structured exercise or brisk walking ≥3 times per week for ≥30 minutes per session for at least six months.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The inclusion criteria select participants typical of those who would receive exercise interventions in usual care. The exclusion criteria remove those unable to participate safely or adhere to the intervention. Overall, the criteria seem intended to enhance applicability to the target population.

Score: [4]

Recruitment

Relevant quotes: 
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;PwMS were recruited via the Sheffield MS Clinic and flyers/community adverts displayed at the local South Yorkshire MS Society branches.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: Participants were recruited through a clinic and community adverts, which requires some additional effort beyond routine appointments but is still moderately pragmatic. This approach would reach the target population.

Score: [3] 

Setting

Relevant quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Supervised exercise sessions involved up to three participants and lasted for approximately one hour.&quot;</span> 
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Studies show that aerobic exercise, resistance exercise and combined programmes bring health benefits to PwMS.&quot;</span>
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The prescribed strength training was based on individual functional needs, as assessed by the trial physiotherapist (NS).&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The supervised exercise sessions took place at a university exercise research facility with input from physiotherapists. This specialized setting differs from the typical real-world setting where most patients receive exercise interventions.

Score: [2] 

Organization

Relevant quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;An exercise physiologist supervised the delivery of the intervention but with physiotherapist input during the early stages of the programme.&quot;</span>
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Strength training was undertaken by 48 of 60 participants in the intervention group and typically involved two to six different resistance exercises (e.g. wall press-ups, arm-curls, leg abduction, wall squats and/or regular squats, knee extensions, calf raises, sit-to-stand) each session.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The intervention required supervision by an exercise physiologist and physiotherapist input, exceeding the expertise and resources commonly available. The strength training component was individualized based on physiotherapist assessment. This level of specialized staffing and individual tailoring indicates greater organization than usual care.

Score: [2]

Flexibility: delivery

Relevant quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Studies show that aerobic exercise, resistance exercise and combined programmes bring health benefits to PwMS. Hence, the programme was designed to be pragmatic and accessible, taking into account exercise preferences and giving choices.&quot;</span> 
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The cognitive-behavioural elements were integrated into the exercise sessions using strategies appropriate to the conversation, stage of change and concerns/questions raised by participants.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The delivery allowed flexibility in choosing aerobic, resistance, or combined exercise based on participant preferences. The cognitive-behavioral component was also tailored to each participant's needs. This flexibility matches usual practice.

Score: [4] 

Flexibility: adherence

Relevant quote: 
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Home exercise during the intervention period comprised walking, use of home exercise equipment, public facilities (including swimming) and gardening for the majority of participants.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: Participants had flexibility in how they adhered to the home exercise component, choosing activities based on individual circumstances and preferences. No special measures enforced adherence. This matches usual care.

Score: [5]

Follow-up

Relevant quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Outcomes were assessed at baseline, and at three months (post-intervention) and nine months after randomisation.&quot;</span>
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The GLTEQ asks participants to recall the frequency of strenuous, moderate and mild intensity exercise for periods >15 minutes over the past seven days and is a valid measure of habitual exercise in PwMS.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: Follow-up assessments were done at 3 and 9 months post-randomization, exceeding typical frequency but not excessively burdensome. The primary outcome was self-reported physical activity, matching usual methods. Overall somewhat more intensive than usual care.

Score: [3]

Primary outcome

Relevant quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The primary outcome was self-reported exercise behaviour at three months using the Godin Leisure Time Exercise Questionnaire (GLTEQ).&quot;</span> 

Reasoning: The primary outcome of self-reported exercise behavior is directly relevant to participants and assesses a patient-centered goal of the intervention.

Score: [5]

Primary analysis

Relevant quote:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;All analyses were by intention to treat, whereby participants were analysed in the arm to which they were randomised irrespective of whether they complied with the intervention.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The analysis followed an intention-to-treat approach, consistent with a pragmatic attitude.

publication full text</span> (mean similarity 100%)</i></p>
<pre>
Here are the PRECIS-2 domain scores and justifications based on the trial publication:

Eligibility criteria:

Relevant quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Inclusion criteria were: age of 18 years or above; BDI score of at least 14 on two consecutive occasions and no treatment from psychologist, psychotherapist or psychiatrist within the last three months.&quot;</span>
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Exclusion criteria were: poor English language skills or cognitive function (score of less than 24 on Mini Mental State Examination); BDI score of at least 29 on two consecutive occasions; active suicidal ideas; current or life-time diagnosis of psychosis, organic mental disorder or substance dependency; Kurtzke Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score of 8.5 or above.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The inclusion criteria are reasonably broad, including adults with MS and BDI score ≥14. However, some exclusions like poor English, cognitive issues, psychosis, etc. reduce generalizability. The BDI cutoffs also exclude those with milder or more severe depression. Overall, moderately pragmatic.

Score: [3]

Recruitment:

Relevant quotes:  
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Invitations were made between October 2008 and July 2009: face-to-face by consultants in the Sheffield Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust MS clinic (n = 288); by the Sheffield MS nurses visiting patients (n = 4); and, using ink-signed personalised letters mailed out from a neuropsychologist at Sheffield (n = 40) as well as from consultant neurologists at the Walton Centre for Neurology and Neurosurgery NHS Trust, Liverpool (n = 250).&quot;</span>

Reasoning: Recruitment was done through MS clinics and mailings to MS patients at two sites. This seems moderately pragmatic as it recruits through usual appointments and registries, but requires some additional effort beyond routine care.

Score: [3] 

Setting:

Relevant quotes:  
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;We reached our recruitment target on 30 July 2009 (in 281 days) after adding a second centre (The Walton Centre NHS Foundation Trust, Liverpool).&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial was conducted at two specialized MS centers. This limits generalizability somewhat but is reasonably pragmatic.

Score: [4]

Organization:

Relevant quotes: 
- No clear information provided on resources, staffing, training, etc. for delivering the intervention.

Reasoning: The publication does not contain enough details to assess this domain.

Score: [NA]

Flexibility (delivery):

Relevant quotes:
- No clear information provided on flexibility in delivering the CCBT intervention. 

Reasoning: The publication does not contain enough details to assess this domain.

Score: [NA]

Flexibility (adherence): 

Relevant quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Of the 12 patients in the CCBT arm, 9 (75%) completed at least four CCBT sessions.&quot;</span> 
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Only one person receiving CCBT formally requested discontinuation of treatment (after Session 6 of 8) citing time and lack of enthusiasm as reasons.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: There seems to be reasonable flexibility in adherence. Patients completed varying numbers of CCBT sessions with no compulsory adherence. This is moderately pragmatic.

Score: [3]

Follow-up:

Relevant quotes:  
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The collection of outcome data by postal questionnaire proved to be challenging, with multiple attempts to obtain data from many participants, particularly at later outcome assessment points.&quot;</span>
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants expressed concern about the face validity, for people with MS, of the questionnaires used for the measurement of self-reported depression, including the Beck Depression Inventory II.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: Follow-up was done via postal questionnaires with some persistence in contacting patients. However, the extensive questionnaires were burdensome. Moderately pragmatic.  

Score: [3]

Primary outcome:

Relevant quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The primary clinical endpoint was the mean change in self-reported symptoms of depression as measured on the BDI.&quot;</span> 

Reasoning: The BDI for depression symptoms is reasonably patient-important, though participants questioned its validity. Moderately pragmatic.

Score: [3]

Primary analysis:

Relevant quotes:  
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Primary analysis was an Intention To Treat (ITT) analysis which analysed all 24 participants according to their randomised treatment assignment ignoring non compliance, protocol deviations and withdrawal.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: Primary analysis was intention-to-treat. This is pragmatic.

Here are the PRECIS-2 domain scores and explanations based on the trial publication text:

Eligibility criteria

Quotes: 
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Key inclusion criteria permitted the participation of men or women ≥18 years of age with confirmed and documented RRMS diagnosis (as defined by the Revised McDonald criteria)&quot;</span>

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Key exclusion criteria were previous exposure to GA40, a progressive form of MS or neuromyelitis optica, the use of experimental or investigational drugs, participation in clinical drug studies within the 6 months before screening, recent use of immunosuppressive medications or immunoglobulins/monoclonal antibodies, or previous use of alemtuzumab, cladribine, cyclophosphamide, or mitoxantrone.&quot;</span>

The trial had some typical inclusion/exclusion criteria for an RRMS trial, including confirmed RRMS diagnosis, adult patients, and no prior exposure to the study drug GA40. However, it excluded patients who participated in other clinical trials in the past 6 months and those who used certain immunosuppressives or monoclonal antibodies, which are not typical exclusions in routine practice. Overall, the criteria are moderately pragmatic.

Score: [3] 

Recruitment

Quotes:
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Eligible patients were randomly assigned 1:1 to receive subcutaneous injections of GA40 (n = 431) or GA20 (n = 430).&quot;</span>

No details provided on how patients were recruited.

There is insufficient information provided to assess the recruitment methods.

Score: [NA]

Setting

Quotes:
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The CONFIDENCE study was a multinational, multicenter, randomized, parallel-group, phase 4, open-label study conducted at 88 study centers in 14 countries (Russia, Poland, Italy, France, Croatia, US [including Puerto Rico], Mexico, Spain, Austria, Turkey, Belgium, Argentina, Germany, and Finland) across different geographic regions.&quot;</span>

The trial was conducted across 88 sites in 14 countries globally. This represents a pragmatic setting that is likely generalizable to the target patient population.

Score: [4]

Organisation

Quotes: 
No relevant quotes.

There are no details provided on resources, provider expertise, or care delivery organization.

Score: [NA] 

Flexibility: Delivery

Quotes:
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Five scheduled visits at study sites occurred at screening (within 2 weeks prior to baseline), baseline (Month 0), and Months 1, 3, and 6 (end of the core phase).&quot;</span>

The treatment schedule was fixed with mandated study visits. This represents a more explanatory approach.

Score: [2]

Flexibility: Adherence

Quotes: 
<span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 98.9%):

self-reported, daily athome MSQ assessments on Days 1 through 7 after the baseline visit.' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;Self-reported, daily at-home MSQ assessments on Days 1 through 7 after the baseline visit.&quot;</span>

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Adherence to treatment when the dosing schedule differs is complicated, because missing one dose has potentially differential impacts on treatment. Thus, adherence was measured using the self-reported MS-TAQ.&quot;</span>

Adherence was measured but no measures were mentioned to enforce or improve adherence. This represents a pragmatic approach.

Score: [4]

Follow-up

Quotes:
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Five scheduled visits at study sites occurred at screening (within 2 weeks prior to baseline), baseline (Month 0), and Months 1, 3, and 6 (end of the core phase).&quot;</span> 

<span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 99.2%):

Follow-up visits were mandated at fixed intervals. Additionally, patients completed daily assessments at home for the first week. This intensive follow-up is more explanatory.

Score: [2]

Primary outcome

Quotes:
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The primary endpoint was patient overall satisfaction with the medication as measured by the single-item MSQ 7-point scale (1 = extremely dissatisfied to 7 = extremely satisfied)&quot;</span>

The primary outcome was patient satisfaction measured by MSQ, which is a patient-centered and pragmatic outcome.

Score: [4]

Primary analysis

Quotes:
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis set included all randomly assigned participants and were analyzed according to the treatment group to which they were randomly assigned, regardless of which treatment they actually received.&quot;</span>

An ITT analysis was used, which represents a pragmatic approach.

<pre>
Here are the PRECIS-2 assessments for the trial described in "668.pdf":

1. Eligibility criteria 

Relevant quotes:

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;To be included, people had to be aged 18 years or more, have a confirmed diagnosis of relapsing–remitting MS, have an Ambulation Index score of 2, 3 or 4 (mild to moderate walking disabilities), and have received medical clearance to participate.&quot;</span>

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Volunteers were excluded if they had an acute exacerbation of MS within 2 months of starting the program, had benign or progressive/relapsing types of MS, had a serious unstable medical condition, had any concurrent condition, for example stroke, or had participated in a PRT program in the 6 months before training started.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The eligibility criteria are reasonably broad, including adults of any age with confirmed relapsing-remitting MS and mild to moderate disability. However, some exclusions like recent exacerbations and concurrent conditions may limit generalizability. Overall, seems moderately pragmatic.

Score: [3]

2. Recruitment  

Relevant quotes:

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants were recruited through a statewide organization providing education and support to people with MS, and a large specialist MS outpatient clinic.&quot;</span> 

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;If interested, volunteers were asked to contact one of the researchers (KD) by telephone, during which volunteers were screened to ensure they satisfied the inclusion criteria.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: Participants were recruited through an MS organization and specialist clinic, which are appropriate sources for the target population. However, they had to proactively contact the researchers, which introduces some self-selection bias. Overall, moderately pragmatic recruitment.

Score: [3] 

3. Setting

Relevant quotes:

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Each program was attended by a group of up to 12 participants, and they were supervised by up to three experienced trainers (physiotherapists and registered personal sports trainers). Each trainer directly supervised a sub-group of three or four participants. Each exercise session was completed in around 45 min, and at the end of each session there was a 30-min recovery period when the participants had refreshments and time to socialize.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The exercise training took place in community gymnasiums, which is a reasonably pragmatic setting. However, the level of supervision by trainers may exceed what is typical in the community setting. Overall, moderately pragmatic.

Score: [3]

4. Organization

Relevant quotes:

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The training intensity was based on recommendations of the American College of Sports Medicine (2009) and consisted of two sets of 10–12 repetitions of each exercise, at a training intensity of 10–12 repetition maximum (that is, only 12 consecutive repetitions of each exercise could be completed before muscle fatigue was reached).&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The training program seems to follow standard guidelines without requiring extra resources or expertise beyond what would be available in a typical community setting.

Score: [4] 

5. Flexibility: delivery

Relevant quotes:

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;While these were the core exercises, they could be individualized. For example, if any exercise caused discomfort, the starting position was modified or the exercise was replaced.&quot;</span> 

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Each exercise session was completed in around 45 min, and at the end of each session there was a 30-min recovery period when the participants had refreshments and time to socialize.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The exercise program allows for some individualization and flexibility in delivery while following a standardized protocol. The social component also adds flexibility. Overall, moderately pragmatic.

Score: [3]

6. Flexibility: adherence 

Relevant quotes: None found.

Reasoning: No clear information provided on measures to enforce or encourage adherence.

Score: [NA] 

7. Follow-up

Relevant quotes:

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Outcome measurements were taken three times: at baseline, after 10 weeks to determine the immediate effects of the intervention, and after a further 12 weeks (week 22) to determine if any benefits from the program had been sustained.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: Follow-up at 10 and 22 weeks is reasonably pragmatic and aims to assess sustained effects over time. Overall, moderately pragmatic.

Score: [3]

8. Primary outcome

Relevant quotes: 

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Changes in walking endurance were measured with the 2-minute walk test (2MWT).&quot;</span>

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Changes in maximal walking speed were measured by recording the time taken to walk the middle 10 m of a level 14-m walkway using a stopwatch.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The walking tests measure outcomes that are highly relevant for patients with MS and mobility impairments. Pragmatic choice of outcomes.

Score: [5]

9. Primary analysis

Relevant quotes:

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Intention-to-treat analysis was applied, with all participants who were allocated and commenced their program included in analysis. Where data were missing, the carry forward technique was used.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: Use of intention-to-treat analysis with all randomized participants is a pragmatic approach.

Here are the PRECIS-2 scores and justifications for the trial described in the article <span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 99.5%):

Effects of an individual 12-week communitylocated “start-to-run” program on physical capacity, walking, fatigue, cognitive function, brain volumes, and structures in persons with multiple sclerosis' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;Effects of an individual 12-week community-located “start-to-run” program on physical capacity, walking, fatigue, cognitive function, brain volumes, and structures in persons with multiple sclerosis&quot;</span> (669.pdf):

Eligibility criteria

Quotes: 
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Adults with MS were recruited through announcements at REVAL rehabilitation research institute (UHasselt), Flemish MS rehabilitation centers and MS Society, and Move-to-Sport. Adults diagnosed with MS were included based on the ability to walk 5 km without rest or use of assistive device.&quot;</span>

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Exclusion criteria were reports to have run 5 km in the preceding 6 months or a relapse occurring in the preceding 3 months.&quot;</span> 

Reasoning: The eligibility criteria are moderately pragmatic - adults with MS who are able to walk 5km without assistance are likely quite similar to the target population who would receive this intervention in usual care. However, excluding those who ran 5km recently and those with a recent relapse makes it slightly less pragmatic.

Score: [3]

Recruitment

Quotes:
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Interested pwMS attended an information session and jointly walked 5 km for verification of their ability.&quot;</span>

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;pwMS were assigned to the experimental (EXP) or the “waiting list control” (WLC) group prior to baseline testing.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: Recruitment seems moderately pragmatic - patients self-selected by responding to announcements and demonstrating ability to walk 5km. However, requiring an information session and verification walk makes recruitment slightly more effortful than would occur in usual care.

Score: [3] 

Setting

Quotes:
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Neural imaging was recorded at UZA (University Hospital Antwerp, in Wilrijk) on another day mostly within 1-week time period.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The setting is a university hospital, which is more specialized than the typical setting for an exercise intervention. This reduces pragmatism. However, it is only for the neural imaging component - the training itself was done by participants in their local community setting. Overall, moderately pragmatic.

Score: [3]

Organization

Quotes: 
<span title='Moderate quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 79.2%):

S received training instructions by email.' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ff9e81'>&quot;Participants received training instructions by email.&quot;</span> 

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;They were asked to train three times weekly according to a personalized training intensity schedule that was based on their baseline aerobic capacity.&quot;</span>

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants wore an activity tracker (Withings Pulse Ox) at the waist that registered the intensity of steps per minute.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The organization of the intervention delivery seems quite pragmatic - participants received remote instructions to complete training on their own in their community, with minimal oversight. This matches usual care.

Score: [4] 

Flexibility: Delivery

Quotes:
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The relative amount of running gradually increased until participants were able to run 5 km without interruption at 12 weeks.&quot;</span>

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;If a participant had been inactive, a phone call was made for enquiry.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: There was some flexibility in delivery as participants could train at their own pace, but the protocol did dictate that they must progress to running 5km continuously by 12 weeks. The check-ins for inactive participants also reduces flexibility. Moderately pragmatic.

Score: [3]

Flexibility: Adherence

Quotes:
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants who completed the training program showed high adherence. The EXP group completed 607 of 648 prescribed sessions (94%).&quot;</span> 

Reasoning: No specific strategies were used to enforce adherence - participants self-monitored and were simply encouraged to follow the program. Very pragmatic.

Score: [5] 

Follow-up

Quotes:
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Evaluation was performed at REVAL by a study nurse, a PhD student in Rehabilitation Sciences and Physiotherapy, and the project dedicated researcher (MSc in exercise physiology, PhD).&quot;</span>

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Evaluation was standardized by an instruction booklet, composed under supervision of senior researchers and a neuropsychologist, and practiced during tester training sessions preceding the trial.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: Follow-up required multiple visits for testing at the research center with trained staff, using standardized evaluation procedures. Much more intensive follow-up than would occur in usual care.

Score: [2]

Primary outcome

Quotes:
<span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 99.6%):

Aerobic capacity was assessed on an electronically braked cycle ergometer (eBike Basic ® ; General Electric GmbH, Bitz, Germany) with continuous pulmonary gas exchange analysis (Oxycon, Erich Jaeger GmbH, Germany), and heart rate (HR) monitoring (Polar ®' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;Aerobic capacity was assessed on an electronically braked cycle ergometer (eBike Basic®; General Electric GmbH, Bitz, Germany) with continuous pulmonary gas exchange analysis (Oxycon, Erich Jaeger GmbH, Germany), and heart rate (HR) monitoring (Polar ®).&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The primary outcome of aerobic capacity is quite relevant to participants, but the specialized equipment used to measure it is not typical of usual care. Moderately pragmatic.

Score: [3]

Primary analysis

Quote: 
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Intention-to-treat analysis was performed.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: Use of intention-to-treat analysis is consistent with a pragmatic approach.

Here are the PRECIS-2 scores for the trial in the attached paper "670.pdf":

Eligibility Criteria

Relevant quotes:

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The inclusion criterion for the study was a diagnosis of multiple sclerosis, and therefore the spectrum of clinical presentations was broad, as would be expected in this client population.&quot;</span>

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;All participants had prior experience of massage treatment at the clinic.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The inclusion criteria is simply a diagnosis of MS, with no additional exclusions beyond what would occur in usual care. All subtypes of MS are included. The participants are typical MS patients who self-selected to receive massage therapy. The broad eligibility matches usual care for MS patients receiving massage therapy.

Score: [5]

Recruitment

Relevant quotes:

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Clients attending the clinic were interviewed, and their case histories recorded. The research project was explained, and written informed consent was obtained.&quot;</span> 

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Of the fifteen study participants, all had previously received a diagnosis of multiple sclerosis.&quot;</span>

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;All participants had prior experience of massage treatment at the clinic.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: Participants were recruited directly from the clinic they were already attending for massage therapy. No extra effort was made to recruit participants beyond their routine clinic visits.

Score: [5] 

Setting

Relevant quotes:

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants were clients seen in the multiple sclerosis clinics at Sutherland-Chan School, in which the study was conducted.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The setting is a clinic specializing in massage therapy for MS patients. This matches the setting where MS patients would normally receive massage therapy in usual care.

Score: [5]

Organization

Relevant quotes:

<span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 98.6%):

treatment plans were approved by the clinical teacher in charge. The teacher also monitored treatment delivery, which involved the application of a variety of techniques appropriate to the client’s needs.' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;The treatment plans were approved by the clinical teacher in charge. The teacher also monitored treatment delivery, which involved the application of a variety of techniques appropriate to the client’s needs.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The massage therapy was provided by supervised student therapists, reflecting the resources and expertise typical of a teaching clinic. No additional training, staffing, or resources beyond what is standard for a teaching clinic were provided.

Score: [5] 

Flexibility: Delivery

Relevant quotes:

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The heterogeneity of the client/participant population precluded an overly prescriptive approach to treatment, and it is worth noting that this heterogeneity is also a component of the normal clinical reality of therapists involved with multiple sclerosis clients.&quot;</span>

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;An appropriate history and physical examination was performed, and a treatment plan determined, this being reflective of the therapist’s assessment and the mutually set goals for the treatment series.&quot;</span> 

Reasoning: The massage therapy treatment plans were individualized based on therapist assessment and mutually agreed upon goals with each client, allowing for flexibility in delivery. No strict protocol was enforced. This matches the flexibility in usual care.

Score: [5]

Flexibility: Adherence

Relevant quotes: 

No relevant quotes.

Reasoning: The paper does not mention any measures to enforce or monitor adherence. It appears patients received massage therapy during their clinic visits with no requirement to otherwise adhere to treatment. This matches the flexibility in usual care.

Score: [5]

Reasoning: Follow-up was limited to completion of the self-efficacy survey at 5 designated time points. There was no intensified follow-up of patients beyond completion of the surveys. This matches the flexibility in usual care.

Score: [5]  

Primary Outcome

Relevant quotes:

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The outcome measures for the current research were the scores yielded by the Multiple Sclerosis Self Efficacy (MSSE) survey.&quot;</span> 

<span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 99.2%):

Studies indicate that higher self-efficacy scores are reflective of an improved ability to adjust to multiple sclerosis (Schnek et al., 1995; Wassem, 1992). This improved adjustment then leads to reduced psychological morbidities such as stress, anxiety and depression, which will result in improved quality of life.' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;Studies indicate that higher self-efficacy scores are reflective of an improved ability to adjust to multiple sclerosis, which then leads to reduced psychological morbidities such as stress, anxiety and depression, which will result in improved quality of life.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The primary outcome is self-reported self-efficacy, which directly measures outcomes that are meaningful to MS patients - adjustment, reduced psychological morbidity, and quality of life. This matches the outcomes typically addressed in massage therapy for MS patients.

Score: [5]

Primary Analysis

Relevant quotes:

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The data were analyzed on an intention to treat basis, with a focus on the differences between mean MSSE values of the control and intervention groups.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: An intention-to-treat analysis was used including all participants as randomized. This pragmatic analysis matches the flexibility in usual care.

Here are the PRECIS-2 scores for each domain based on the provided full text:

Eligibility criteria:

Relevant quotes:

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Key inclusion criteria were age older than 18 years, a diagnosis of progressive multiple sclerosis (primary or secondary) according to McDonald’s criteria,21 and a score of 6·5–8·0 on the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS).&quot;</span>

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Key exclusion criteria were being within 3 months of ceasing a multiple sclerosis disease modifying drug, receiving steroid treatment within the preceding month, or participating in another clinical trial.&quot;</span>  

The eligibility criteria are moderately pragmatic. The inclusion criteria target adults with progressive MS and significant disability based on EDSS score. This represents the intended population for the intervention. The exclusions are limited and reasonable - recently changing medications, in another trial, or recent steroids could confound results. Overall, the criteria include the intended population but with some restrictions.

Score: [3]

Recruitment:

Relevant quotes:  

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants were recruited through eight health care organisations, including the UK National Health Service (NHS) Trusts, social enterprises, and third sector multiple sclerosis therapy centres, in two regions (Devon–Cornwall and East Anglia) of the UK.&quot;</span>

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Individuals were invited consecutively until the allocated number of standing frames (dependent on commissioning costs) at each health care organisation had been reached.&quot;</span>

The recruitment is very pragmatic. Participants were recruited consecutively from routine health care settings where they already receive care. No additional efforts were made to identify or recruit participants.

Score: [5] 

Setting:

Relevant quotes:

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants were recruited through eight health care organisations, including the UK National Health Service (NHS) Trusts, social enterprises, and third sector multiple sclerosis therapy centres, in two regions (Devon–Cornwall and East Anglia) of the UK.&quot;</span>

The setting is very pragmatic. Participants were recruited from their usual health care settings where they routinely receive care. Multiple sites were used to increase generalizability.

Score: [5]

Organization:

Relevant quotes:

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;All participants received their usual health and social service input throughout the study period.&quot;</span>

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The intervention consisted of two home-based physiotherapy sessions (60 min each) to set up the standing frame programme, supported by six follow-up telephone calls (15 min per call).&quot;</span> 

The organization is very pragmatic. Participants received their usual care and the standing program was incorporated into the home setting with limited additional resources - some extra physiotherapy time for training and follow-up calls. No substantial changes were made to expertise or resources.

Score: [5] 

Flexibility (delivery):

Relevant quotes:

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;To standardise and optimise implementation of the intervention, we provided educational materials and assessed fidelity to them.&quot;</span>

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;In line with previous research,14 participants were asked to stand in the frame for 30 min three times per week over 20 weeks, and to record the frequency and duration of each stand in a daily diary.&quot;</span>

The flexibility of delivery is moderately pragmatic. Some standardization was provided through educational materials and fidelity assessment to optimize implementation. But the delivery allowed flexibility in how the standing program was incorporated into routine care. Participants recorded frequency and duration butwere not protocolized beyond the 30 min per session target.

Score: [4]

Flexibility (adherence): 

Relevant quotes:

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;This allowed for a graduated introduction to standing.&quot;</span> 

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;At the end of the 20 week period, participants were encouraged to continue to regularly stand, although no further physiotherapy support was provided.&quot;</span>

The flexibility of adherence is very pragmatic. Participants were encouraged to stand regularly, but no measures were in place to enforce adherence. They were free to engage with the intervention on their own schedule.

Score: [5]

Follow-up:

Relevant quotes:

<span title='Moderate quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 91.4%):

assessments were done independently and away from the participant’s home.' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ff9e81'>&quot;Outcome assessments were done independently and away from the participant’s home.&quot;</span>

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;All participants were asked to record new symptoms, falls, and medication changes in a daily preformatted diary.&quot;</span> 

The follow-up is moderately pragmatic. Assessments were done independently in a masked manner. Participants recorded information daily in a diary, but otherwise follow-up matched usual care without additional in-person visits.

Score: [4]

Primary outcome:

Relevant quotes:  

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The primary outcome was motor function as measured by the Amended Motor Club Assessment (AMCA) score23 at the primary endpoint of 36 weeks post-randomisation.&quot;</span>

The primary outcome is very pragmatic. The AMCA score measures motor function through assessment of key functional tasks, which is highly relevant and meaningful to the participants.

Score: [5]

Primary analysis:

Relevant quotes:

<span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 99.6%):

The primary analysis of the primary outcome, AMCA score at 36 weeks, followed a modified intention to treat approach, regardless of compliance to the inter vention, but did exclude patients who were deemed ineligible after randomisation, those who withdrew from the trial and were unwilling for their previously collected data to be used, or those who did not provide baseline and week 36 measurements (ie, there was no imputation of missing baseline or week 36 scores for the primary analysis), and used an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) approach.' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;The primary analysis of the primary outcome, AMCA score at 36 weeks, followed a modified intention to treat approach, regardless of compliance to the intervention, but did exclude patients who were deemed ineligible after randomisation, those who withdrew from the trial and were unwilling for their previously collected data to be used, or those who did not provide baseline and week 36 measurements (i.e., there was no imputation of missing baseline or week 36 scores for the primary analysis), and used an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) approach.&quot;</span>

The primary analysis is moderately pragmatic. It is an intention-to-treat approach with limited exclusions and no imputation. This retains a pragmatic approach while also accounting for some missing data issues.

<pre>
Here are the PRECIS-2 scores and explanations for the trial described in the attached full text "673.pdf":

Eligibility criteria:

Relevant quotes:
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Eligible participants were over 18 years of age and had a diagnosis of MS that was confirmed by a consultant physician or neurologist.&quot;</span>

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Persons with MS were excluded if they had a previous relapse or began steroid therapy in the 12 weeks prior to participating in the first assessment, were pregnant, or had a comorbidity that severely impacted their ability to safely participate in exercise.&quot;</span>

The eligibility criteria are fairly broad, including adults with confirmed MS diagnosis. The main exclusions are for safety reasons like recent relapse, pregnancy, or comorbidities. Overall, the criteria seem to target a patient population that is typical for MS trials and interventions in usual care.

Score: [4] Rather pragmatic

Recruitment: 

Relevant quotes:  
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants were referred to the project by themselves, their care-giver, MSI, chartered physiotherapists, neurologists, general practitioners or clinical nurse specialists.&quot;</span>

<span title='Moderate quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 93.2%):

Participants were enrolled following their eligibility assessments, performed by the regional offices of MSI.' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ff9e81'>&quot;Eligible participants were enrolled following their eligibility assessments, performed by the regional offices of MSI.&quot;</span> 

Participants were referred from typical sources like physicians and self-referral. Eligibility was assessed by MSI regional offices rather than study staff. Recruitment seems fairly similar to how patients would access interventions outside the trial.

Score: [4] Rather pragmatic

Setting:

Relevant quotes:
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;This was a multi-centre, block randomised, assessor blind, controlled study. The methods of the trial were previously described in detail.&quot;</span> 

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;All interventions took place in groups of eight, for an hour per week, for 10 weeks. They were delivered in community centres such as local gyms, hotels and health centres.&quot;</span>

The study took place across multiple centers and community settings where patients would normally access exercise classes. This matches usual care.

Score: [5] Very pragmatic

Organization:

Relevant quotes: 
No relevant quotes found.

The paper does not provide much detail on organization. However, the interventions were delivered in community centers without substantially different staffing or resources than usual care.

Score: [4] Rather pragmatic

Flexibility: Delivery

Relevant quotes:
For PT-led: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The PT-led exercise provided was pre-defined. It consisted of a circuit-style class of exercises that were either resisted by body weight or by the addition of free weights.&quot;</span> 

For yoga: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The yoga intervention was also not predefined, and detailed descriptions of the classes were gathered by nine of the instructors.&quot;</span>

The PT-led intervention followed a defined protocol, while the yoga classes were flexible without a fixed protocol. Overall delivery flexibility seems moderately pragmatic.  

Score: [3] Equally pragmatic/explanatory

Flexibility: Adherence

Relevant quotes:
No adherence monitoring mentioned beyond tracking class attendance.

No special measures were described to enforce or monitor adherence. Appears very pragmatic.

Score: [5] Very pragmatic  

Follow-up:

Relevant quotes: 
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Trained assessors tested the participants in week 1, participants exercised during weeks 2–11 and then were assessed again at week 12.&quot;</span>

Follow-up was limited to pre and post assessments with no additional contact. Very pragmatic.

Score: [5] Very pragmatic

Primary outcome:

Relevant quotes:  
<span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 99.5%):

The primary outcome measure was the physical component of the Multiple Sclerosis Impact Scale29, version 2 (MSIS-29v2), a patient-reported outcome measure that assesses the physical impact of MS.' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;The primary outcome measure was the physical component of the Multiple Sclerosis Impact Scale-29, version 2 (MSIS-29v2), a patient-reported outcome measure that assesses the physical impact of MS.&quot;</span>

The primary outcome was self-reported physical impact, which is patient-centered and pragmatic.

Score: [5] Very pragmatic

RRMS than those published previousl' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: red'>&quot;Exclusion criteria have been published previously&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial included RRMS patients with at least 1 relapse despite prior therapy. While the exclusion criteria are not listed, this indicates a reasonably inclusive target population that is likely similar to patients who would receive the intervention in real world practice. However, the inclusion of only patients with inadequate response to prior therapy makes the criteria more selective.

Score: [3]

2. Recruitment

Relevant quotes:

<span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 95.1%):

EDSS assessments at baseline, every 3 month' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;EDSS assessed at baseline, every 3 months&quot;</span>

<span title='Moderate quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 93%):

s administered the MSFC 16 3 times before baseline to attenuate practice effects, then every 6 month' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ff9e81'>&quot;MSFC administered 3 times before baseline, every 6 months&quot;</span> 

Reasoning: Participants were assessed at regular intervals, but the described frequency of every 3-6 months does not seem excessive compared to real world practice. However, the intensity of measurement is not fully clear.

Score: [3]

8. Primary outcome

Relevant quotes:

<span title='Major quote deviation, possible hallucination. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 69%):

disability improvement (CDI) K' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: red'>&quot;disability improvement (CDI) based on EDSS&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The EDSS is a standard scale used in real world practice to assess MS disability. CDI is a patient-centered outcome measuring improvement rather than just delayed worsening.

Score: [5] 

9. Primary analysis

Relevant quotes: 

No relevant quotes about the primary analysis.

Reasoning: Unable to assess based on information provided.

publication full text</span> (mean similarity 100%)</i></p>
<pre>
Here are the PRECIS-2 domain scores and explanations for the trial described in the publication "675.pdf":

Eligibility criteria

Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Inclusion criteria: diagnosis of relapsing-remitting (but no more than 2 exacerbations within the last year) or secondary progressive MS and an Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score of ≤6 (no to moderately severe disability), with ≤1 step increase within the last year.&quot;</span>
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Excluded were patients with reported or medically recorded diagnoses of current serious psychological disorders other than depression and anxiety syndromes, evidence of dementia as indicated by testing below the fifth percentile in at least 3 of 6 dimensions of neuropsychological functioning (i.e., attention and concentration, processing speed, executive function, verbal memory, and verbal processing), other currently life-threatening or severely disabling physical disorders, current MS exacerbation, symptomatic MS medication altered in the last 3 months, other disorders of the CNS, pregnancy, or inability to speak or read German.&quot;</span>

Explanation: The eligibility criteria are quite restrictive, excluding many patients with comorbidities, those with more severe MS progression, those on certain medications, and those with issues like pregnancy or inability to speak German. While some exclusions for safety reasons would be expected in usual care, many patients who would otherwise receive mindfulness training are excluded here, reducing applicability.

Score: [2] 

Recruitment

Quotes: 
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;A total of 164 patients with MS referred themselves after having received information via the outpatient neurology clinic of the University Hospital Basel, other physicians, or advertisements posted in the Swiss Multiple Sclerosis Society Bulletin.&quot;</span>

Explanation: Patients self-referred after seeing advertisements, indicating substantial extra recruitment effort beyond what would occur in usual care. This reduces applicability.

Score: [2]

Setting

Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The study was conducted from February 2007 to March 2009.&quot;</span>
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Neurologists verified all patients for the following inclusion criteria: 1) diagnosis of relapsing-remitting (but no more than 2 exacerbations within the last year) or secondary progressive MS and 2) an Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score of ≤6 (no to moderately severe disability), with ≤1 step increase within the last year.&quot;</span>
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The study was approved by the Ethics Commission of Both Basels and is registered at www.controlled-trials.com, ISRCTN21643919.&quot;</span>

Explanation: The study was conducted at a single center, the University Hospital Basel in Switzerland. Having only a single specialized academic center reduces applicability.

Score: [2]

Organization 

Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;MBI closely followed the program of mindfulness-based stress reduction and included 1) a personal intake interview to define realistic goals of participants and establish personal rapport; 2) 8 weekly 2.5-hour classes in mindfulness practices (10–15 participants/group); 3) one Saturday, 7-hour session at week 6; 4) homework assignments (approximately 40 minutes/day), emphasized as essential to success of the program; 5) a postintervention interview to evaluate personal experiences, goal attainment, and future maintenance of acquired skills. Each class covered specific exercises and topics within the context of mindfulness training, i.e., practices during lying, sitting, and dynamic yoga postures, as well as during everyday life, e.g., stressful situations and social interactions. Mindfulness exercises included observation of sensory, affective, and cognitive domains of perceptible experience. The all-day retreat integrated familiar exercises and presented new ones. In all, 6 MBI courses for the experimental arm of the study were individually conducted by 2 experienced, certified teachers, each with ≥9 years teaching experience.&quot;</span>

Explanation: The mindfulness training required specially trained and experienced instructors to deliver the intervention. This level of expertise and resources exceeds what would be available in usual care settings, reducing applicability.

Score: [2] 

Flexibility: delivery

Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;MBI closely followed the program of mindfulness-based stress reduction and included 1) a personal intake interview to define realistic goals of participants and establish personal rapport; 2) 8 weekly 2.5-hour classes in mindfulness practices (10–15 participants/group); 3) one Saturday, 7-hour session at week 6; 4) homework assignments (approximately 40 minutes/day), emphasized as essential to success of the program; 5) a postintervention interview to evaluate personal experiences, goal attainment, and future maintenance of acquired skills.

In all, 6 MBI courses for the experimental arm of the study were individually conducted by 2 experienced, certified teachers, each with ≥9 years teaching experience.&quot;</span>

Explanation: The mindfulness training followed a detailed protocol with specific exercises and topics covered in each session. This reduces flexibility in delivery compared to what providers would have in usual care.

Score: [2]

Flexibility: adherence 

Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Four of 76 patients dropped out of the MBI course and did not complete postintervention inventories (5%). Two reported a loss of interest, one disease-related problems, and one no reason.&quot;</span>

Explanation: Patients who dropped out were not included in the analysis. This reduces flexibility in adherence compared to usual care where patients would be encouraged to adhere but not excluded. However, the dropout rate was very low at only 5%. 

Score: [4] 

Follow-up

Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Reported outcome measurements occurred within 2 weeks before and after intervention and 6 months postintervention.&quot;</span>
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The following instruments were used (see appendix e-1 on the Neurology® Web site at www.neurology.org for details).&quot;</span> 

Explanation: Follow-up assessments were done at baseline, post-intervention, and 6 months. This is more frequent than would occur in usual care but is not overly intensive.

Score: [3]

Primary outcome

Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Primary outcomes included disease-specific and disease-aspecific HRQOL, depression, and fatigue.&quot;</span>
- <span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 99.4%):

HRQOL was assessed with 2 inventories, one developed for patients with chronic disorders (i.e., diseaseaspecific) and the other specifically for patients with MS.' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;HRQOL was assessed with 2 inventories, one developed for patients with chronic disorders (i.e., disease-aspecific) and the other specifically for patients with MS.&quot;</span>

Explanation: The primary outcomes of HRQOL, depression, and fatigue are directly relevant for patients and measure constructs important in usual care.

Score: [5] 

Primary analysis

Quotes: 
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Intention-to-treat analyses are reported. Data of missing study patients were imputed by linear multiple regression that adjusted for age, gender, and disease progression (entry EDSS score; STATISTICA 6.0).&quot;</span>

Explanation: An intention-to-treat analysis was used including all randomized patients. This matches usual care.

<pre>
Here are the PRECIS-2 scores for the trial based on the given publication:

Eligibility criteria:

Relevant quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Patients were eligible for recruiting if they met the following criteria: (1) age > 18 years; (2) established diagnosis of the specific pathological condition MS, stroke or TBI; (3) nine hole peg test (NHPG) performed in more than 25 seconds; (4) ability to move at least one peg in 180 seconds during the NHPG; (5) sufficient autonomous functioning; (6) internet connection or telephone line and reachable internet provider; (7) clinical status stable; (8) discharged from hospital or rehabilitation setting – person lives at home.&quot;</span>

- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Exclusions were: a) disturbed upper limb function not related to MS, TBI or stroke; B) serious cognitive and/or behavioral problems; c) serious emotional problems; D) major visual problems; (e) communication problems; F) medical complications; G) other problems possibly contra-indicating autonomous exercise at home.&quot;</span>

The eligibility criteria are quite broad, including adult patients with a diagnosis of MS, stroke or TBI who have some preserved upper limb function and can exercise autonomously at home. The exclusions seem reasonable for safety and feasibility of the intervention. Overall, the criteria seem similar to what would be used in usual care.

Score: [4] Rather pragmatic

Recruitment:

Relevant quotes: 
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Patients were recruited from Unità Organica di riabilitazione Intensiva Neuromotoria (UOrIN, Italy), Foundation Institute Guttmann (FPING, Spain) and from National Multiple Sclerosis centre (NMSc, Belgium).&quot;</span>

- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The physicians of the three rehabilitation centres included patients following the inclusion and exclusion criteria.&quot;</span>

Patients were recruited directly from rehabilitation centers where they were already receiving care. No additional efforts beyond usual care seem to have been made to recruit participants.

Score: [5] Very pragmatic

Setting:

Relevant quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Patients were recruited from Unità Organica di riabilitazione Intensiva Neuromotoria (UOrIN, Italy), Foundation Institute Guttmann (FPING, Spain) and from National Multiple Sclerosis centre (NMSc, Belgium).&quot;</span>

- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;All measurements were performed at the centre where the patient had been treated.&quot;</span>

The trial was conducted at the same rehabilitation centers where patients were already receiving care. The setting matches usual care.

Score: [5] Very pragmatic

Organization: 

Relevant quotes:
- No details provided on expertise or resources needed to deliver the intervention.

Score: [NA] Not enough information 

Flexibility (delivery):

Relevant quotes: 
- No details provided on protocol flexibility or restrictions for delivery of intervention.

Score: [NA] Not enough information

Flexibility (adherence):

Relevant quotes:
- No details provided on measures to enforce or monitor adherence.

Score: [NA] Not enough information

Follow-up:

Relevant quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The second measurement (t1) was performed after the month of usual care (for intervention as well as control group). The third measurement (t2) was performed after the month of H-CAD intervention for the intervention group and 2 months after baseline for the control group. A month after t2 a follow up measurement was performed (t3) for the intervention group. The control group received their last measurement (t3) 4 months after baseline.&quot;</span>

Follow-up visits were scheduled at 1 month intervals to assess outcomes. This seems more frequent than typical follow-up in usual neurological rehabilitation care.

Score: [2] Rather explanatory

Primary outcome:

Relevant quotes: 
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Two outcome parameters representing the performance of the affected arm on functioning as well on disability level were used in the present study as main outcome parameters. In case both arms were affected, the dominant hand was used the main outcome parameters were the ara test and the NHPt.&quot;</span>

The ARA test and NHPT are standardized tests that assess arm/hand function. The outcomes seem clinically meaningful for this population.

Score: [4] Rather pragmatic

Primary analysis:

Relevant quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;A maximum of 7 patients in the intervention group and of 4 patients in the control group had missing data on all tests, thus list wise deletion was applied to all analyses.&quot;</span>

No intention-to-treat analysis mentioned. Patients with missing data were excluded from analysis.

Score: [2] Rather explanatory</pre>

publication full text</span> (mean similarity 99.2%)</i></p>
<pre>
Here are the PRECIS-2 scores and rationale for the trial described in "678.pdf":

Eligibility criteria

Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Patients in South East London who were severely affected by MS were referred by clinicians to the trial.&quot;</span>
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Exclusion criteria included if the referring staff or the screening deemed patients had very urgent needs or were deteriorating rapidly when immediate referral to the service was offered.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial included patients with MS who were referred by clinicians as having palliative care needs. Some patients with very urgent needs were excluded. Overall, the eligibility seems fairly similar to patients who would receive palliative care in usual practice.

Score: [4] 

Recruitment 
Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;After baseline interview, patients were randomly allocated to either a multiprofessional palliative care team (PCT) immediately (fast track) or the control care group who continued best usual care for three months and then were offered the PCT.&quot;</span>
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Reasons for drop out, no interview, and refusal were recorded whenever possible.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: Patients were recruited after being referred by clinicians. Some patients dropped out or refused, but reasons were recorded. Recruitment seems fairly similar to how patients would access palliative care services in usual practice.

Score: [4]

Setting
Quotes: 
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Patients in South East London who were severely affected by MS were referred by clinicians to the trial.&quot;</span>
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Subjects were 69 people with MS, 52 of whom took part in the trial.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial was conducted in a specific region (South East London) with MS patients referred from that area. The setting seems fairly similar to usual practice.

Score: [4]

Organisation
Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;In addition to continuing to receive usual services (see below), patients in the fast-track group received care from a PCT.&quot;</span> 
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;This comprised one part-time consultant in palliative medicine, one part-time clinical nurse specialist, one administrator, and one psychosocial worker, and was based in a large teaching hospital.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: Patients received a palliative care intervention from a specialized team, in addition to usual care. This required some additional resources and organization compared to usual practice.

Score: [3]

Flexibility: delivery

- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Patients had one to three contacts (visits and/or phone calls) from the PCT, although a small number (around 12%) were referred for longer-term ‘‘community’’ palliative care.&quot;</span>
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The PCT undertook assessments, suggested ways to improve physical, emotional, social, and other problems, provided specialist welfare benefits advice and bereavement support, and liaised with and acted as a catalyst for local services, both primary and specialist teams.&quot;</span> 

Reasoning: The palliative care intervention involved an initial assessment and recommendations for care tailored to each patient's needs. This seems fairly flexible and similar to how palliative care would be delivered in usual practice.

Score: [4] 

Flexibility: adherence
Quotes: None relevant

Reasoning: The trial does not mention any measures to enforce or monitor patient adherence. This domain seems not applicable for this palliative care intervention.  

Score: [NA]

Follow-up
Quotes:
- <span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 95.4%):

We collected outcome and cost data at baseline (before randomization) and at 6, 12, 18 (only control groupdafter they received PCT), and 24 weeks.' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;Data were collected at baseline (before randomization) and at 6, 12, 18 (only control groupdafter they received PCT), and 24 weeks.&quot;</span>
- <span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 99.6%):

Our standardized questionnaires included the Palliative Care Outcome Scale (POS8), 24,25 comprising eight questions on anxiety, patient and carer concerns, and practical needs, each rated 0e4; a single-item POS pain score (rated 0 [best] to 4 [worst]); and caregivers’ burden (using the 12-item version of the Zarit Carer Burden Inventory [ZBI]).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;Our standardized questionnaires included the Palliative Care Outcome Scale (POS-8), a single-item POS pain score (rated 0 [best] to 4 [worst]); and caregivers’ burden (using the 12-item version of the Zarit Carer Burden Inventory [ZBI]).&quot;</span>

Reasoning: Follow-up data were collected via interviews and questionnaires at multiple time points, more than would occur in usual practice. This was to assess outcomes for the trial.

Score: [2] 

Primary outcome
Quotes:
- <span title='Moderate quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 94%):

High scores indicate greater burden/symptoms, a negative change in score implies a reduction (i.e., an improvement).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ff9e81'>&quot;High scores represent greater burden/symptoms, a negative change in score implies a reduction (i.e., an improvement).&quot;</span>
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;At 12 weeks, caregiver burden was 4.47 points lower (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.05e7.89) in the fast track compared to the control group.&quot;</span> 

Reasoning: The primary outcome was caregiver burden, measured by a validated scale. This seems highly patient-centered and relevant for palliative care.

Score: [5]

Primary analysis
Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;We planned an intention-to-treat analysis, irrespective of whether patients were assessed as having palliative care needs or the nature of contact with the PCT.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: An intention-to-treat analysis was planned, meaning all randomized patients were analyzed regardless of adherence. This is a very pragmatic approach.

publication full text</span> (mean similarity 99.9%)</i></p>
<pre>
Here are the PRECIS-2 scores and explanations for the trial described in the publication "679.pdf":

Eligibility criteria

Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Eligibility criteria for patients: diagnosis RRMS since at least one year, EDSS score ≤4.0, no symptoms suggestive of a relapse, no relapse in the preceding four weeks, willing and capable of participating in the investigations, and having access to the internet for performing the web-based assessments.&quot;</span>

The eligibility criteria are fairly broad, including RRMS patients with low disability (EDSS ≤4.0) and no recent relapse. The main exclusions are due to inability to participate or for safety reasons. Overall, the criteria seem reasonably similar to patients who would receive this intervention in usual care.

Score: [4] Rather pragmatic

Recruitment

Quote: <span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 98.8%):

pants were recruited from all over the Netherlands by the patient organisation NMSF, Rotterdam, the Netherlands. Interested patients were contacted by a registered nurse experienced in MS (MH) by phone to check diagnosis and eligibility criteria.' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;Patients were recruited from all over the Netherlands by the patient organisation NMSF, Rotterdam, the Netherlands. Interested patients were contacted by a registered nurse experienced in MS (MH) by phone to check diagnosis and eligibility criteria.&quot;</span>

Patients were recruited nationwide through a patient organization, with initial screening by phone. This recruitment approach seems moderately pragmatic, going beyond standard clinic visits but not as intensive as media campaigns or other special efforts.

Score: [3] Equally pragmatic/explanatory 

Setting

Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;CDT was given during three consecutive days in Zorghotel Spelderholt, Beekbergen, the Netherlands, a facility especially equipped for the accommodation of people with impaired health.&quot;</span>

The intervention was delivered at a specialized facility for people with impaired health. This suggests a slightly more explanatory setting compared to the usual care setting where this intervention would be applied.

Score: [2] Rather explanatory

Organization

Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The multidisciplinary team included a psychiatrist, psychiatric nurse, neurologist, registered nurse specialized in MS, physiotherapist, dance therapist, and a person with MS.&quot;</span> 

The intervention involves a specialized multidisciplinary team. This level of expertise and resources is likely greater than what would be available in usual care.

Score: [2] Rather explanatory

Flexibility (delivery)

Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Small group sessions form the actual training&quot;</span> [...] <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants autonomously chose between the various small group sessions without being influenced by team members.&quot;</span>

The delivery allows flexibility in components based on patient choice. This matches usual care.

Score: [4] Rather pragmatic

Flexibility (adherence) 

No measures to enforce adherence are mentioned. Patients seem to have flexibility similar to usual care.

Score: [4] Rather pragmatic

Follow-up

Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Assessments were at baseline and at one, three and six months follow-up via online questionnaires.&quot;</span>

Follow-up is more frequent than usual care but uses online questionnaires to minimize burden. Overall somewhat more intensive follow-up than usual care.

Score: [3] Equally pragmatic/explanatory

Primary outcome

Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The primary study outcome was the change in control self-efficacy, assessed by the Multiple Sclerosis Self-Efficacy Scale (MSSES)&quot;</span>

The primary outcome of self-efficacy is patient-centered and clinically meaningful.

Score: [5] Very pragmatic

Primary analysis

Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;All endpoints were analyzed according to the intention-to-treat principle using an ANCOVA&quot;</span> 

Full intention-to-treat analysis is very pragmatic.

Here are the PRECIS-2 scores and explanations for the trial described in "680.pdf":

Eligibility criteria

Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Inclusion criteria: 1) having a definite diagnosis of MS from a neurologist; 2) being within 5 years of receiving a diagnosis of MS; 3) scoring at least 10 on the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II); 4) not currently undertaking other psychological treatment for depressive or anxiety symptoms for the length of participation in the current trial; 5) speak English fluently; 6) no current or lifetime diagnosis of psychosis; 7) no current substance dependency; 8) no gross cognitive impairment; and 9) no changes to medications prior and during involvement in the trial.&quot;</span>

Explanation: The eligibility criteria are moderately pragmatic as patients are included who would likely receive the intervention in usual care - newly diagnosed MS patients with depressive symptoms. However, exclusions for psychosis, substance dependency, and medication changes make it slightly less pragmatic. The groups were well matched demographically.

Score: [3]

Recruitment

Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants were recruited through neurologists working in a large MS outpatient clinic at the hospital, advertisements on MS related websites and local press releases.&quot;</span>

Explanation: Recruitment was done through neurologists at an MS clinic which is moderately pragmatic. Additional recruitment through websites and press releases makes it slightly less pragmatic than recruiting only through clinics.

Score: [3] 

Setting

Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The study took place at a large teaching and research hospital in Melbourne, Australia.&quot;</span>

- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants were recruited through neurologists working in a large MS outpatient clinic at the hospital.&quot;</span>

Explanation: The trial took place at a specialty MS clinic at a large hospital. This is a reasonably pragmatic setting for MS patients who would likely receive specialized care. However, a multi-center design would have been more pragmatic.

Score: [3]

Organization

Quotes: 
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;A senior clinical psychologist and a provisional clinical psychologist (supervised by the clinical psychologist) provided the intervention.&quot;</span>

Explanation: The intervention was provided by clinical psychologists with expertise in MS, which reflects a reasonably pragmatic level of resources and provider expertise that would be available in usual specialized care.

Score: [3]

Flexibility: delivery

Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The CBT intervention consisted of 8 individual modules which focused on CBT based principles and strategies.&quot;</span> 

- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;For the intervention, a therapy manual was developed by the first author, which included tailored modules and skills for MS patients.&quot;</span>

Explanation: The delivery of the CBT intervention seems moderately flexible and tailored to MS patients' needs, though the use of a standardized manual makes it moderately less pragmatic.

Score: [3] 

Flexibility: adherence

Quotes:

Explanation: There seem to be no specific measures to enforce adherence beyond self-motivation. This indicates a highly pragmatic approach.

Score: [5]

Follow-up

Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants completed questionnaires at pre- and post-treatment and at 20 weeks follow up.&quot;</span> 

- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Follow up assessments ended April, 2015.&quot;</span>

Explanation: Follow-up at post-treatment and 20 weeks is moderately pragmatic and similar to what would occur in usual care.

Score: [3]

Primary outcome  

Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The primary outcome was level of depressive symptoms at post and 3 month follow up which was measured with the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II).&quot;</span>

Explanation: The BDI-II measures depressive symptoms which is a patient-centered and pragmatic primary outcome.

Score: [5] 

Primary analysis

Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;All statistical analyses included a sample of 30 participants at pre, post and 20 weeks follow up.&quot;</span>

Here are the PRECIS-2 scores for the clinical trial described in 681.pdf:

Domain 1 - Eligibility criteria

Quotes:
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants had a confirmed diagnosis of multiple sclerosis, an Extended Disability Status Scale score of 5 (ambulatory without aid or rest for about 200 m) to 6.5 (constant bilateral assistance required to walk about 20 m without resting), stable rehabilitation and drug therapy for 30 days before entry into the study, cognitive scores of over 24 on the Mini-Mental State Examination and access to the intervention sites using their own or public transport.&quot;</span>

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Potential participants were excluded if they had experienced exacerbation of their multiple sclerosis symptoms three months prior to the study, or had any medical condition which may preclude them from taking part in the exercise intervention.&quot;</span>

The eligibility criteria target a specific population of patients with multiple sclerosis who have moderate disability, based on their Extended Disability Status Scale score. Participants must have stable disease and medication use. They exclude those with recent exacerbations or other medical conditions that would prevent participation. The criteria seem reasonably similar to those who would receive this intervention in usual care.

Score: [4] Rather pragmatic

Domain 2 - Recruitment

Quote: 
<span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 98.9%):

Of the 873 patients on the clinical register for multiple sclerosis 159 patients were deemed suitable for the study. These people were sent invitation letters and participant information sheets. Forty-three potential participants expressed an interest in participating.' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;From the 873 patients on the clinical register for multiple sclerosis 159 patients were deemed suitable for the study. These people were sent invitation letters and participant information sheets. Forty-three potential participants expressed an interest in participating.&quot;</span>

Recruitment was done by screening a clinical registry for suitable patients based on inclusion/exclusion criteria, and inviting them to participate. This seems like a fairly typical process for recruiting patients in usual care. No extraordinary efforts like media campaigns or incentives were mentioned.

Score: [4] Rather pragmatic  

Domain 3 - Setting

Quote:
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The intervention took place at two different geographical locations (Site A and Site B).&quot;</span>

The study was conducted at two community leisure centres, which seems like a typical setting where patients would receive this type of exercise intervention as part of usual care.

Score: [5] Very pragmatic

Domain 4 - Organization

The same physiotherapist was present at both sites; however fitness instructors were different between sites.&quot;</span>

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The group session involved a 10-minute warm-up of aerobic and stretching components, 30–40 minutes of circuit exercises (Appendix 1 on-line), designed to train aerobic endurance, resistance and balance, and a 5–10 minute cool-down, involving aerobic work, stretching and relaxation.&quot;</span>

The intervention was delivered by a physiotherapist and fitness instructor, which seems consistent with the expertise and resources used to deliver this type of intervention in usual care. The exercise regimen also appears typical. No extraordinary staffing, training, or resources were mentioned.

Score: [5] Very pragmatic

Domain 5 - Flexibility (delivery)

Quote: 
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Through discussion with the instructors, participants chose which level of each exercise they deemed appropriate and also when and how each exercise should be progressed. Participants worked at a self-regulated pace for each exercise.&quot;</span>

The delivery of the intervention seems very flexible, with participants able to choose the level and progression of exercises based on discussion with instructors. This matches the flexibility expected in usual care.

Score: [5] Very pragmatic

Domain 6 - Flexibility (adherence)

Quotes:
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Attendance of participants at each class was recorded.&quot;</span>

No special measures to enforce or monitor adherence were mentioned besides recording class attendance. Participants seem free to engage with the intervention as in usual care.

Score: [5] Very pragmatic

Domain 7 - Follow-up

Quotes:  
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Outcome measures were carried out within the local hospital’s rehabilitation unit. They were taken at baseline, after 8 and 12 weeks of the intervention period (i.e. either the exercise class or usual care).&quot;</span>

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;By taking outcome measures at week 8 and week 12 our study aimed to assess the optimum length of exercise intervention required.&quot;</span>

Follow-up assessments were done at 8 and 12 weeks, which is likely more frequent than would occur in usual care. However, the motivation seems to be evaluating the optimal intervention length rather than intensively monitoring patients.

Score: [3] Equally pragmatic and explanatory  

Domain 8 - Primary outcome

Quote:
<span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 99.6%):

The Timed 25Foot Walk Test measures walking speed over a short distance and has shown good reliability and validity in the multiple sclerosis population as an individual component of the Multiple Sclerosis Functional Composite disability assessment.' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;The Timed 25-Foot Walk Test measures walking speed over a short distance and has shown good reliability and validity in the multiple sclerosis population as an individual component of the Multiple Sclerosis Functional Composite disability assessment.&quot;</span>

The primary outcome of walking speed is highly relevant and meaningful to patients with multiple sclerosis.

Score: [5] Very pragmatic

Domain 9 - Primary analysis

Quote: 
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;All outcome measures were analysed on the basis of intention to treat, with all variables summarized and comparisons made between groups and over time.&quot;</span>

An intention-to-treat analysis was used including all participants as randomized. This is a very pragmatic approach.

<pre>
Here are the PRECIS-2 scores for the trial described in "682.pdf":

1. Eligibility criteria 

Quotes:
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Inclusion criteria were (1) ambulatory (can walk 100 m, be capable of walking 100 metres without a walking aid corresponding to a classification of ≤5.5 on the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS),10 even if they do use an aid for daily activities; and (2) self-reported to be sedentary or irregularly active at time of study entry (i.e. do not exercise 30 minutes or more twice per week of moderate to vigorous activity).&quot;</span>

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Excluded were people who were (1) unable to speak and read English or French; (2) unable to respond to simple questions on orientation and memory; (3) have an additional illness that restricts their function; and/or (4) experienced a relapse during the past 30 days as this may affect physical activity/exercise participation.&quot;</span>

The eligibility criteria are fairly broad, including ambulatory patients with multiple sclerosis up to EDSS 5.5. The main exclusions are due to inability to participate in the intervention and assessments. Overall, the criteria seem reasonably similar to patients who would receive exercise interventions in usual care.

Score: [4]

2. Recruitment

Quotes: 
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;People were recruited from four multiple sclerosis clinics in three Canadian cities and from posting on media sites.&quot;</span>

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;During the clinic visit, the treating neurologist introduced the study to their patients and referred them to the research assistant who further explained the study and assessed eligibility. Those contacting the research team directly were assessed for eligibility over the phone and sent information on the study electronically.&quot;</span>

Recruitment was done both through clinic visits and media advertising. Clinic visits likely reflect usual care recruitment, but media advertising less so. Overall seems like a mix of usual care and extra recruitment effort. 

Score: [3]

3. Setting

Quotes:
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;A total of 137 people were randomized mostly from the two Montreal sites (n = 130).&quot;</span> 

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The recruitment target was met only at the main site.&quot;</span>

The trial was conducted across multiple sites, but mainly at one site in Montreal. Unclear how similar the settings are to usual care.  I don't see enough information to confidently score this domain.

Score: [NA] 

4. Organization

Quotes:
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants in both groups received two private training sessions with the physical therapist or exercise therapist. For the MSTEP© group, the sessions were used to assess individual needs and design an individualized programme. For the Guideline group, the sessions were used to instruct on the guidelines and learn how to apply principles of safe and effective exercise. All were provided with a portfolio of exercise instructions.&quot;</span>

The intervention required training sessions with physical/exercise therapists. This represents more resources than would be typical in usual care.

Score: [2]

5. Flexibility: delivery

Quotes:
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The MSTEP© programme is to promote regular bouts of activity most days per week, encouraging a balance between rest and activity, and taking into consideration the physical and emotional status and capacity of the person.&quot;</span>

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;A unique feature of MSTEP© was to specifically target cardio-aerobic capacity through cardio-intensive exercise prescribed two times per week (Push Days) using the concept of interval training.&quot;</span> 

The MSTEP intervention allows for flexibility in delivery based on the participant's needs and status. But Push Days represent a protocol-driven component. Overall, reasonably flexible but not identical to usual care.

Score: [4]  

6. Flexibility: adherence

Quotes:
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;All participants were contacted every two weeks during the first two months, then monthly thereafter by the exercise instructor by telephone or email for follow-up by the instructor. The purpose of follow-up contacts is to provide an opportunity to ask any questions they have and also to facilitate long-term retention in the study.&quot;</span>

The follow-up contacts were to provide support and facilitate retention, not specifically to enforce adherence. No other adherence measures mentioned. Seems reasonably similar to usual care.

Score: [4]

7. Follow-up

Quotes:
<span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 95.3%):

l, data on 25 variables were evaluated for each of two groups across three Figure 1. CONSORT diagram. 6 Clinical Rehabilitation 00(0) contrasts, with those with baseline only as the reference category.' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;In total, data on 25 variables were evaluated for each of two groups across three contrasts, with those with baseline only as the reference category.&quot;</span>

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Almost half (n = 66; 48%) of those randomized could not be included in the analysis as they had no outcome data.&quot;</span> 

Substantial loss to follow-up, but no mention of extraordinary follow-up efforts for those who remained. Limited follow-up data presented.

Score: [4]

8. Primary outcome

Quotes:  
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The primary outcome was exercise capacity as measured by peak oxygen consumption (VO2peak) using a modified Bruce protocol on the cycle ergometer.&quot;</span>

VO2peak is a direct measure of exercise capacity relevant to participants.

Score: [5]

9. Primary analysis

Quotes:
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Those who were included in the intention-to-treat analysis were those 3-month ‘survivors’ and multiple imputation was used to impute subsequent missing data.&quot;</span>

Intention-to-treat analysis used with multiple imputation of missing data.

- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Potential subjects were excluded if they had rapidly progressing disease, were already involved in a physiotherapy programme, had additional neurological conditions or other medical conditions which would preclude them taking part in the study.&quot;</span> 

The eligibility criteria are reasonably similar to the intended recipients who would receive physiotherapy in usual care. The EDSS range selects people moderately to severely disabled by MS, who are the typical recipients of home-based physiotherapy. The exclusion criteria remove some atypical cases like those already receiving physiotherapy. Overall the eligibility seems reasonably pragmatic.

Score: [4]

Recruitment:

Quotes:  
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;People moderately to severely affected by MS were recruited from the MS Service, NHS Ayrshire and Arran.&quot;</span>

No extra recruitment efforts beyond contacting patients from an MS service are mentioned. This matches usual care recruitment.

Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Each session lasted up to 60 minutes, and a task-specific programme included upper and lower limb strengthening using theraband, mobile pedals, and weights. Repetition of tasks such as sit to stand, gait, balance (using gym balls and sit fits) and stretching activities were used depending on the subjects previously identified goals.&quot;</span>

The physiotherapy sessions were delivered by an experienced domiciliary physiotherapist, using typical physiotherapy equipment and activities. No additional training, staffing or resources beyond usual care are mentioned.

Score: [5] 

Flexibility: delivery

Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Each subject therefore received core treatments aimed to maximize strength, flexibility and function.&quot;</span>

The physiotherapy program was individualized based on each patient's goals. No fixed protocol or monitoring of compliance is mentioned. This matches the flexibility of usual physiotherapy care.

The average number of sessions received by participants was 14.8 (out of a possible 16).&quot;</span>

Follow-up assessments were done at baseline, 8 weeks, and 16 weeks. The 8-week follow-up matches the end of the intervention period. The 16-week follow-up is a limited one-time longer term follow-up. This follow-up schedule does not seem much different from usual care.

Here are the PRECIS-2 scores and explanations for the trial described in "685.pdf":

Eligibility criteria

Quotes:
- <span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 98%):

The only selection criterion was that the diagnosis of MS was con rmed by the general practitioner.' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;The only selection criterion was that the diagnosis of MS was confirmed by the general practitioner.&quot;</span>
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;There were no exclusion criteria.&quot;</span>

Score: [5] 

The trial had very pragmatic eligibility criteria. The only requirement was a confirmed diagnosis of MS by a general practitioner. There were no exclusion criteria, meaning anyone with MS could participate, which aligns with usual care. This demonstrates an intention for a very pragmatic trial.

Recruitment

Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants were volunteers with MS who were recruited through voluntary organizations, were community based and lived in West London and in counties contiguous with Greater London.&quot;</span>

Score: [4]

Recruiting through voluntary organizations in the community setting where the intervention will be applied is a pragmatic approach, though not quite as pragmatic as recruiting during usual clinic visits. However, no excessive efforts like media campaigns or incentives were mentioned, just utilization of existing community resources. Overall, this seems rather pragmatic.

- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;It was a community-based research study, which was approved by the appropriate local research ethics committees, and was conducted at the Centre for Research in Rehabilitation at Brunel University’s Osterley Campus in West London from June 1996 until February 1999.&quot;</span>

Score: [3] 

Conducting the study at a university research center is more explanatory than a community or home setting. However, it was in the local area where recruitment occurred. The setting does not seem very pragmatic or very explanatory.

Organization

Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Individuals were assigned to group or one to one sessions by the health professional in consultation with each person, and based on their needs and wishes. Sessions were conducted either at participants’ homes or in local therapy centres.&quot;</span>

Score: [4]

Delivering the intervention at participants' homes or local centers, assigned based on individual needs, seems consistent with usual care. No mention of requiring extra training, staffing, or resources. The organization appears rather pragmatic.

Flexibility: delivery

Quotes:
- <span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 98.4%):

Score: [5] 

The delivery of the intervention was tailored to each participant's priorities and interests. This matches usual care and allows for full flexibility.

Flexibility: adherence

Quotes: None relevant

Score: [NA]

No discussion of measures to enforce adherence. As an educational intervention, adherence does not seem highly applicable.

Follow-up

Quotes:
- <span title='Moderate quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 85.7%):

assessments were conducted six months after baseline.' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ff9e81'>&quot;Follow-up assessments were conducted six months after baseline.&quot;</span>

Score: [4]  

A single follow-up assessment 6 months later does not seem much different from usual care. This seems rather pragmatic.

Primary outcome

Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Total scores on a postal version of the Barthel Index, a scale measuring mobility, the SF-36, and one measure developed for the study; the Standard Day Dependency Record (SDDR), were the main outcome measures.&quot;</span>

Score: [4]

The outcomes of mobility, quality of life, and independence in daily activities seem relevant and important to participants. Measuring with validated scales is consistent with research. Overall, the choice of outcomes appears rather pragmatic.

Primary analysis

Quotes: None relevant

Score: [NA]

Here are the PRECIS-2 scores for the trial described in the attached publication "686.pdf":

Eligibility criteria 
Relevant quotes:
- <span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 98.2%):

2012. Inclusion criteria were: having MS (MacDonald criteria); being able to complete a questionnaire; and being in need for a multidisciplinary approach, defined by the requirement, in addition to the neurology specialist, of at least two different medical (rehabilitation specialist, neurourology specialist, psychiatrist) or allied health professionals (physiotherapist, occupational therapist, social worker, psychologist, and neuropsycholo' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;Inclusion criteria were: having MS (MacDonald criteria); being able to complete a questionnaire; and being in need for a multi-disciplinary approach, defined by the requirement, in addition to the neurology specialist, of at least two different medical (rehabilitation specialist, neuro-urology specialist, psychiatrist) or allied health professionals (physiotherapist, occupational therapist, social worker, psychologist, and neuropsychologist).&quot;</span>
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Patients who were not living independently in the community were excluded.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The eligibility criteria are moderately broad - patients with any type of MS who need multidisciplinary care could participate, as long as they were living independently and could complete questionnaires. Some severely disabled patients who were not independent would be excluded. Overall, the criteria allow a fairly wide range of MS patients who would need multidisciplinary care in real-world practice to participate.

Score: [3]

Recruitment 
Relevant quotes: No information provided.

Reasoning: The publication does not describe how patients were recruited.

Score: [NA] 

Setting
Relevant quotes:  
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;This is a prospective, randomized, controlled, monocentric clinical trial in MS patients.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial was conducted at a single hospital center, which limits the generalizability of the results. The setting is more explanatory than pragmatic.

Score: [2]

Organisation
Relevant quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;An integrated intervention within a multidisciplinary outpatient clinic gathering the different team members is thought to offer the best management of MS.&quot;</span>

These patients received a half-day (four to six hours) individually tailored assessment by the multidisciplinary group.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: In the integrated multidisciplinary (IMD) intervention arm, patients received a comprehensive assessment by the full multidisciplinary team in a single long visit. This level of care delivery likely requires more resources and coordination than typical real-world care. The organization is more explanatory than pragmatic.

Score: [2] 

Flexibility of experimental intervention - Delivery

Reasoning: The delivery of the IMD intervention arm was standardized for all patients - they were all assessed by the full multidisciplinary team and given integrated recommendations. There was little flexibility in how the intervention was delivered. This approach is more explanatory.  

Score: [2]

Flexibility of experimental intervention - Adherence
Relevant quotes: No information provided.

Reasoning: The publication does not describe any strategies to enforce or monitor adherence.

Score: [NA]

Follow-up
Relevant quotes:  
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The primary outcome was the impact of the strategy on quality of life (QoL) measured using the MSIS-29 scale at inclusion and after six months.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: Patients were followed up at 6 and 12 months to assess outcomes. This frequency of follow-up is moderately pragmatic and similar to what might occur in routine practice.

Score: [3]

Primary outcome
Relevant quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The primary outcome was the impact of the strategy on quality of life (QoL) measured using the MSIS-29 scale at inclusion and after six months.&quot;</span> 

Reasoning: The primary outcome was quality of life assessed by MSIS-29, which is a patient-reported outcome directly relevant to patients. This is a pragmatic choice of primary outcome.

publication full text</span> (mean similarity 100%)</i></p>
<pre>
Here are the PRECIS-2 scores and explanations for the trial based on the full text in "687.pdf":

Eligibility criteria:

Relevant quotes:
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;To be included in the study participants were required to have a confirmed diagnosis of MS, an Expanded Disability Status Score of between 5 and 6.5, stable drug therapy for 30 days, no relapses in the previous three months, no significant co-morbidities such as coexisting cardiac or pulmonary condition and have access to the internet via personal or tablet computer.&quot;</span>

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Of those 37 people expressed an interest in taking part. Seven people were excluded as they did not meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria (Figure 1).&quot;</span>

Explanation: The eligibility criteria are fairly representative of the target population for the intervention in usual care - people with moderate MS (EDSS 5-6.5) who are stable on medication with no recent relapses. The exclusion criteria seem reasonable, excluding those with co-morbidities and requiring internet access for the web-based intervention. Overall, the criteria are moderately pragmatic.

Score: [3]

Recruitment:

Relevant quotes: 
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Letters were sent to 138 patients from the Multiple Sclerosis Service database, thought to be suitable for the study, inviting them to participate.&quot;</span>

Explanation: Participants were recruited by inviting potentially eligible patients from an MS service database by letter. This is a fairly pragmatic approach using existing clinical records to identify patients, though does require some additional effort beyond routine clinical visits.

Score: [4] 

Setting:

Relevant quotes:
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Rehabilitation centre and participants’ homes.&quot;</span>

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants were recruited from the Multiple Sclerosis Service, at the Douglas Grant Rehabilitation Centre, Irvine, Scotland.&quot;</span>

Explanation: The setting included both a rehabilitation center and participants' homes. Delivering part of the intervention at home is very pragmatic, while the rehabilitation center may be more specialized. Overall, moderately pragmatic.

Score: [3]

Organization:

Relevant quotes:
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;This was a pragmatic study with the content of the web-based programme being similar to the content if it had been delivered face-to-face.&quot;</span>

Explanation: The paper states this was a pragmatic study and the web-based program content was similar to face-to-face delivery. This suggests the organization of the intervention was similar to usual care.

Score: [4]

Flexibility (delivery):

Relevant quotes: 
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Individualised therapeutic exercise programmes were developed for participants in Group 1, with exercises selected based on their baseline assessment and personal goals.&quot;</span>

Explanation: The intervention was individualized for each participant based on their assessment and goals. This suggests a high degree of flexibility in delivery.

Score: [5] 

Flexibility (adherence): 

Relevant quotes:
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants were advised to undertake the exercise programme a minimum of twice a week and to complete their online exercise diary which was seen remotely by the physiotherapist.&quot;</span>

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;In terms of compliance with the programme, participants logged on to the website an average 1.3 times per week. There was a reduction in the average number of log-ins over the 12 week intervention period from 2.1 to 0.9.&quot;</span>

Explanation: Participants were advised on the exercise frequency but there was no forced adherence. Compliance was tracked but poor adherence did not lead to exclusion. Overall, a highly pragmatic approach.

Score: [5]

Follow-up:

Relevant quotes:  
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Outcome measures were recorded at baseline and at the end of the intervention period (week 13).&quot;</span>

Explanation: Follow-up was limited to outcome assessment at baseline and end of study. No more than usual care. Highly pragmatic.

Score: [5]

Primary outcome:

Relevant quotes:  
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The primary outcome measure, the timed 25 foot walk, has good reliability and validity in the MS population. The time taken to walk 25ft was recorded with a stop watch and a mean of two ‘walks’ recorded.&quot;</span>

Explanation: The primary outcome was 25 foot walk time, which is a simple walking test relevant and important to participants with MS. Highly pragmatic choice.

Score: [5] 

Primary analysis:

Relevant quotes:
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;There was no other missing data.&quot;</span> 

Explanation: There was no missing data, suggesting all participants were likely included in analysis. A pragmatic approach.

Score: [5]

In summary, this was a reasonably pragmatic trial based on the PRECIS-2 ratings across the domains. Eligibility criteria, setting, organization, flexibility of delivery and adherence, follow-up, primary outcome, and analysis were all scored moderately to highly pragmatic. The main limitations were in eligibility criteria which had some exclusions, and the recruitment which required additional efforts beyond routine care. Overall, the trial design choices match a moderately pragmatic attitude.</pre>

The eligibility criteria are fairly restrictive, with several medical conditions excluded that would not necessarily preclude treatment with the intervention in usual care. An extra test by a specialist is also required for confirmation when the condition is usually diagnosed by a general practitioner. This makes the trial more explanatory.

Here are the PRECIS-2 scores and explanations for the trial described in the publication "689.pdf":

Eligibility criteria

Quotes:
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Potential participants known to Multiple Sclerosis healthcare practitioners working across seven outpatient centres in Scotland – Ayrshire & Arran, Greater Glasgow & Clyde, Dumfries and Galloway, Lanarkshire, Lothian, Fife and Tayside – were informed of the study and issued with a participant information sheet. Potential participants contacted the researchers if they were interested in participating. Participants required to have a clinical diagnosis of Multiple Sclerosis, persistent foot drop (lasting a minimum of three months) observed during a 5-minute walk test, stable disease (no change in the Extended Disability Status Score12 or relapse in previous three months), 5° of passive dorsiflexion and tolerance of functional electrical stimulation.&quot;</span>

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants were excluded if they had previously used functional electrical stimulation or an ankle-foot orthosis for foot drop, moderate to severe cognitive impairment (scored < 26, Montreal Cognitive Assessment),13 foot drop due to other disorders, other conditions significantly affecting gait, contraindications to functional electrical stimulation, marked proximal weakness, plantar flexor spasticity, stance phase instability or severe lower limb/trunk ataxia affecting gait.&quot;</span>

Score: [4] Rather pragmatic

The eligibility criteria seem to target patients typical of those who would receive the intervention in usual care. The main inclusion criteria are a clinical diagnosis of MS, persistent foot drop, and tolerance of FES. The exclusions seem reasonable for safety or to isolate effects in MS patients. The MS diagnosis and foot drop persistence confirm the intended population without extensive additional testing beyond usual care. Overall the criteria seem aimed at a patient population resembling real world usual care.

Recruitment

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Potential participants known to Multiple Sclerosis healthcare practitioners working across seven outpatient centres in Scotland – Ayrshire & Arran, Greater Glasgow & Clyde, Dumfries and Galloway, Lanarkshire, Lothian, Fife and Tayside – were informed of the study and issued with a participant information sheet. Potential participants contacted the researchers if they were interested in participating.&quot;</span>

Score: [5] Very pragmatic  

Patients were recruited through their regular MS healthcare providers at multiple centers. They were informed about the study during their regular appointments and contacted the researchers if interested. This seems very similar to how recruitment would occur if the intervention was implemented in usual care. No special efforts were made to recruit beyond the routine care setting.

Score: [5] Very pragmatic

The trial was conducted at 7 routine MS outpatient centers across different regions of Scotland. This matches the real-world setting where MS patients receive care. Conducting the trial across multiple centers enhances generalizability.

Organization 

Quotes:

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants randomized to the usual care group were fitted with a custom-made, solid, ankle-foot orthosis by an orthotist, within four weeks of their initial assessment. The recommendations made by the Best Practice Statement for ankle-foot orthoses following stroke were applied. The orthoses were made with 5-mm homopolymer polypropylene, trim lines were anterior to the malleoli and reinforcements added to the ankle section as required. The angle of the tibia was inclined forward, approximately 10° to vertical, and each orthosis was ‘tuned’ by the addition or removal of small heel wedges.&quot;</span>

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants randomized to the functional electrical stimulation group were assessed and fitted with an Odstock Dropped Foot Stimulator Pace (OML, Salisbury) device by a physiotherapist experienced in functional electrical stimulation (A.L.). Wired heel switches and a stimulation frequency of 40 Hz were applied. Electrode position, pulse width, waveform and ramping parameters were adjusted for each participant in order to achieve a comfortable and efficient muscle contraction. The current amplitude ranged from 7 to 72 mA (mean = 40 mA).&quot;</span>

Score: [4] Rather pragmatic

The AFO group received usual customized orthotics from an orthotist, following typical procedures. The FES group was fitted by a physiotherapist experienced in FES, using a standard device. This level of expertise would be expected for delivering FES in usual practice. No additional staffing, training, or resources beyond typical care were mentioned. The organization seems largely consistent with real-world implementation.

Flexibility: delivery

Score: [4] Rather pragmatic

The FES parameters were customized for each patient to optimize comfort and efficacy. This flexibility in delivery mirrors how FES would be implemented in usual practice based on individual response. No strict protocols or monitoring of compliance were mentioned. Some standardization of device and parameters is inherent with FES, but the flexibility seems consistent with real-world norms.

Flexibility: adherence 

Quotes:

No relevant quotes found.

Score: [NA]

No details were provided on measures to enforce or monitor adherence.

Follow-up

Quotes:

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Outcome measures were administered by two unblinded assessors (Rebecca Hunter and A.L.) at baseline (0), 3, 6 and 12 months, except for the Psychological Impact of Assistive Devices Score15 which was administered at 12 months only.&quot;</span>

Score: [3] Equally pragmatic/explanatory

Outcomes were assessed at baseline, 3, 6, and 12 months. This follow-up schedule seems moderately intensive but is not drastically different from what would occur in usual practice to monitor impact over time. The selective 12 month assessment of one measure is more pragmatic. Overall the follow-up intensity seems intermediate between typical care and a more idealized research study protocol.

Primary outcome

Quotes: 

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Assessed at 0, 3, 6 and 12 months; 5-minute self-selected walk test (primary), Timed 25 Foot Walk, oxygen cost of walking, Multiple Sclerosis Impact Scale-29, Multiple Sclerosis Walking Scale-12, Modified Fatigue Impact Scale, Euroqol five-dimension five-level questionnaire, Activities-specific Balance and Confidence Scale, Psychological Impact of Assistive Devices Score, and equipment and National Health Service staff time costs of interventions.&quot;</span>

Score: [4] Rather pragmatic

The primary outcome was self-selected walking speed. This is a clinically meaningful outcome directly relevant to patients and decision makers. It was measured similarly to real-world norms. The 5 minute self-selected test may not be used universally but is a simple walking assessment that resembles common evaluations of gait.

All analysis was performed on IBM SPSS v24, using a 5% level of significance (IBM, New York, USA).&quot;</span> 

Score: [4] Rather pragmatic

An intention-to-treat approach was used with mixed models to account for missing data. This includes all randomized participants in the analysis as allocated. The paper does not specifically state that all available data were used, but the intention-to-treat approach implies this was likely the case. Overall the analysis approach favors pragmatism.</pre>

The eligibility criteria include adults with severe MS, defined as having an EDSS score of at least 8.0, complex symptoms, and at least 2 unmet care needs. The criteria seem reasonably aligned with patients who would receive this type of intervention in usual care. However, the inclusion of <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;≥2 unmet care needs&quot;</span> makes the criteria slightly more narrow than in typical practice.

Score: [4] Rather pragmatic

2. Recruitment 

Quote: 
<span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 98.2%):

Patients were recruited from multiple centers, suggesting a pragmatic approach. However, the paper does not provide details on how patients were identified and recruited at each center. 

Score: [3] Equally pragmatic and explanatory  

3. Setting

Quote:
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;We recruited patients from three Italian centers.&quot;</span>

The trial was conducted at 3 centers in Italy. No further details are provided on how typical these centers are compared to usual care settings.

Score: [3] Equally pragmatic and explanatory

4. Organization

Quote: 
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Based on the principles of PC, each center had a HPA team consisting of a physician (neurologist or physiatrist), a nurse (case manager and team leader), a psychologist, and a social worker.&quot;</span>

The HPA intervention required expertise from a multi-disciplinary team. This likely differs from typical care delivery and requires additional resources.

Score: [2] Rather explanatory

5. Flexibility: Delivery

Quote:
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;After a comprehensive assessment of the dyad needs based on direct observation and on visit 1 information&quot;</span> [...] <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;the HPA team defined the contents of the intervention, involving the dyad and the patient caring physician.&quot;</span>

The HPA team tailored the intervention based on assessed needs, suggesting flexibility in delivery. However, details are lacking on how prescriptive the protocol was.

Score: [3] Equally pragmatic and explanatory

6. Flexibility: Adherence

The paper does not mention any measures to enforce or monitor adherence. As this is a home-based palliative care intervention, adherence does not seem very applicable.

Score: [NA]

7. Follow-up

Quotes:
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The blind examiners used a web-based case report form (eCRF), so that visit 1–3 data were available to HPA teams and coordination unit.&quot;</span>

Patients were assessed at baseline, 3 months, and 6 months. The HPA team also recorded their activities in a patient record. This level of follow-up and data collection seems more intensive than typical care.

Score: [2] Rather explanatory

8. Primary outcome

<pre>
Here are the PRECIS-2 scores for the 9 domains based on the full text publication of the trial:

Eligibility criteria:

Relevant quotes:

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The main inclusion criteria were: (1) clinically definite MS diagnosis, (2) fatigue impacting on daily life (Fatigue Severity Scale total score >4) and (3) ambulatory.&quot;</span>

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The main exclusion criteria were: (1) having taken part in a fatigue programme in the last year, (2) cognitive impairments, (3) a relapse in the previous 3 months or (4) having started treatment with disease modifying or antidepressant drugs within the previous 3 months.&quot;</span>

Reasoning:

The inclusion criteria reflect the target population that would receive this intervention in usual care - people with MS and significant fatigue impacting daily life. The exclusion criteria seem reasonable to avoid confounding effects on fatigue. Overall, the eligibility seems to closely match to usual care.

Score: [4]

Recruitment:

Relevant quotes:  

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants were recruited in three UK centres (Poole, Bristol, Southampton/Portsmouth) from primary or secondary care, or via MS Society newsletters/websites.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: 

Participants were recruited through routine clinic visits and newsletters, reflecting usual care recruitment. No extra efforts like media campaigns or incentives were mentioned.

Score: [4] 

Setting:

Relevant quotes:

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;This pragmatic two parallel arm multi-centre randomised controlled trial (RCT) is a formal evaluation of the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of FACETS when added to current local practice.&quot;</span>

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Recruitment took place from May 2008 to November 2009.&quot;</span> 

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Recruitment was 39 from the Bristol centre, 75 from the Southampton/Portsmouth Centre and 50 from the Poole centre.&quot;</span>

Reasoning:

This was a multi-center trial across 3 centers in the UK, increasing generalizability. The settings seem to be routine NHS clinics where fatigue management would normally be delivered.

Score: [4]

Organisation:

Relevant quotes:

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The manualised group-based FACETS programme is described elsewhere and is based upon a conceptual framework integrating elements from cognitive behavioural, social-cognitive, energy effectiveness, self-management and self-efficacy theories.&quot;</span>

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The intervention consists of six sessions (∼90 min duration) held weekly and facilitated in groups of 6–12 by two health professionals with experience of working with people with MS and group-work (such as occupational therapists, nurses or physiotherapists).&quot;</span> 

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Facilitators were all qualified to a senior/advanced level (in the UK minimum of a Band 7 on the NHS Agenda for Change (AfC) grading structure).&quot;</span>

Reasoning:

The intervention was delivered by existing NHS staff with appropriate seniority and experience working with MS patients. No extra training, resources or staffing beyond usual care was mentioned.

Score: [4]

Flexibility (delivery):

Relevant quotes:

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The facilitator manual provides guidance on preparation and delivery, detailed session content, notes and suggested timings, and a checklist of facilitator objectives as well as signposts to additional resources.&quot;</span>

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;A companion participant handbook, along with existing information booklets, reinforces programme content. The incorporation of flipchart exercises, group discussions and homework activities enables the tailoring of content to the individual circumstances and goals/priorities of group members.&quot;</span>

Reasoning:

The manual provides guidance but allows for flexibility in delivery. Homework activities allowed for individual tailoring. No measures to enforce compliance were mentioned.

Score: [4] 

Flexibility (adherence):

Relevant quotes:

No mention of measures to enforce adherence by participants.

Reasoning: 

No measures were described to control or enforce adherence by participants. They seemed free to engage as in usual care.

Score: [5]

Follow-up:

Relevant quotes:

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Individuals who had attended a fatigue management programme in the past year were excluded from the trial as were those who had received a fatigue intervention from a health professional in the past 3 months (see protocol).&quot;</span>

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;All questionnaire outcomes were self-reported for both groups, presented in a booklet format with a large font and administered and returned through the post.&quot;</span>

Reasoning:

Follow-up was done through self-reported postal questionnaires. No extra in-person visits or extensive data collection beyond usual care was mentioned. 

Score: [4]

Primary outcome:

Relevant quotes:

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;These were: (1) fatigue severity (Global Fatigue Severity (GFS) subscale of the Fatigue Assessment Instrument (FAI)), (2) disease-specific quality of life (QOL) (total score on the Multiple Sclerosis Impact Scale, V.1 (MSIS-29, V.1)) and (3) self-efficacy for managing fatigue (Multiple Sclerosis-Fatigue Self-Efficacy scale—adapted from the Control subscale of the MS Self-Efficacy scale).&quot;</span>

Reasoning:

The primary outcomes of fatigue severity, disease-specific QOL, and self-efficacy are highly relevant for MS patients and assess the main aims of the fatigue management intervention.

Score: [5]

Primary analysis:

Relevant quotes:

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The main analysis was intention-to-treat but we also conducted a ‘per protocol’ analysis (excluding participants who attended fewer than four FACETS sessions).&quot;</span>

Reasoning: 

The primary analysis was intention-to-treat, which is a pragmatic approach including all randomized participants.

Here are the PRECIS-2 scores for the clinical trial described in the paper "692.pdf":

Eligibility criteria

Quotes:
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Inclusion criteria for the study included (1) a diagnosis of MS, (2) not currently engaged in rehabilitation, therapy or PA program and able to undertake PA without risk-factors (3) aged between 18 and 65 (4) able to give informed consent and to understand French.&quot;</span>

The eligibility criteria are fairly broad - it includes adults with MS who are able to give consent and aren't currently in a rehab or PA program. The exclusion criteria seem to only exclude those unable to safely participate in PA. Overall, this matches usual care conditions.

Score: [4] 

Recruitment

Quotes: 
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;For this study, individuals were approached by the study coordinator and asked if they would be willing to participate in it.&quot;</span>

The participants were recruited directly by the study coordinator when they came for their regular outpatient clinic visits. This pragmatic recruitment approach reaches patients in their usual care setting.

Score: [4]

Setting

Quotes:
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;This clinical and multicentric trial took place from July 2017 to January 2020, in two hospitals in the Parisian Region, France (Hospitals – CHI Poissy St Germain-en-Laye and R. Poincaré, Garches).&quot;</span>

The trial took place across two hospitals in the patients' geographic region, reflecting real-world conditions.

Score: [4]

Organization

Quotes:
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;A specialized trainer in adapted physical activity delivered experimental interventions and the telephone calls.&quot;</span>

The trial utilized a specialized trainer, which requires more resources than available in usual care. However, this was necessary for proper delivery of the intervention.

Score: [3]

Flexibility: delivery

Quotes:
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;PA consists of the combination of four activities per week: 40 minutes of walking, 40 minutes of muscle building, 20 minutes of stretching and 20 minutes of coordination and balance, with a frequency of 2 hours weekly.&quot;</span>

The PA intervention was standardized and protocolized. Patients had to complete specific amounts of the four activities each week. This reduces flexibility in delivery.

Score: [2] 

Flexibility: adherence

Quotes:
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Practicing sessions were conducted under the supervision of a physical and sports activity trainer specializing in sports training.&quot;</span> 

The PA sessions were supervised, which allows monitoring and encouragement of adherence. However, there is no mention of specific measures to enforce adherence.

Score: [3]

Follow-up

Quotes:
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;All measurements were carried out at two phases of the study T1 (baseline) and T2 (eight weeks after randomization).&quot;</span>

Follow-up matches usual care with assessments at baseline and 8 weeks. No unusually intense measurement or monitoring.

Score: [4]

Primary outcome

Quotes:
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Mobility, fatigue, and the impact of the disease on the patient’s life were measured.&quot;</span>

The primary outcomes like mobility, fatigue, and disease impact are highly patient-centered and relevant for assessing the intervention.

Score: [5] 

Primary analysis

Quotes:
<span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 99.1%):

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The median age in SC group was 42, median EDSS 4 and median EDSSpyr 4. In yoga group the median age was 41, median EDSS 4.2 and median EDSSpyr 2.5.&quot;</span> 

Reasoning: The trial included patients with different types of MS who had pyramidal dysfunction, indicating spasticity. The age range was restricted to 26-50 years old. The EDSS score was restricted to ≤6, indicating moderate disability. These criteria likely excluded some MS patients who would be candidates for these interventions in usual care, such as older patients with more severe disability, making the criteria moderately explanatory.

publication full text</span> (mean similarity 99.6%)</i></p>
<pre>
Here are the PRECIS-2 scores and explanations for the trial described in "694.pdf":

Eligibility criteria

Quotes:
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;MS patients older than 18 years who had a confirmed MS with spasticity of the lower limbs and an Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score between 4 and 6.5 were eligible for inclusion.&quot;</span>

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Patients who had received hippotherapy within the last 12 months, a body weight over 90 kg, no balance while sitting, and acute exacerbation during the 4-week period before start of the therapy were excluded.&quot;</span> 

The eligibility criteria are reasonably broad, including adult MS patients with confirmed diagnosis and EDSS 4-6.5. Some exclusions are made for safety and to avoid carryover effects, but these would likely also be excluded from hippotherapy in usual practice. Overall, the criteria seem fairly pragmatic.

Score: [4]

Recruitment

Quotes:
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Eligible patients were randomized to one of the two groups using sealed opaque envelopes on the basis of a computer-generated randomization list.&quot;</span>

No details are provided on how patients were identified and recruited into the trial. However, it seems that patients were randomized upon being identified as eligible, rather than any special efforts to recruit patients. This suggests a more pragmatic approach.

Score: [4] 

Setting

Quotes: 
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The study was conducted at five sites in Germany, all of which have hippotherapy experience as stipulated by the rules of the German Consortium for Therapeutic Riding.&quot;</span>

Conducting the trial across multiple sites suggests a pragmatic approach to ensure diversity and representativeness. The sites having prior hippotherapy experience matches the setting where this intervention would be delivered in practice.

Score: [5]

Organisation

Quotes:
No relevant quotes.

No details are provided on organization. It is not clear if additional staffing, training, or resources were used beyond what would be typical for hippotherapy in usual care.

Score: [NA]

Flexibility: Delivery

Quotes:
<span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 99.6%):

Patients of the intervention group received hippotherapy (as defined by the regulations for hippotherapy of the Deutsches Kuratorium für Therapeutisches Reiten e.V. (DKThR)) 8 once a week for 12 weeks as an addon therapy to their standard care, which remained unchanged.' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;Patients of the intervention group received hippotherapy (as defined by the regulations for hippotherapy of the Deutsches Kuratorium für Therapeutisches Reiten e.V. (DKThR)) once a week for 12 weeks as an add-on therapy to their standard care, which remained unchanged.&quot;</span>

The hippotherapy intervention is referenced to standard regulations, suggesting it was delivered in a typical standardized fashion. No other details on flexibility of delivery are provided.

Score: [3]

Flexibility: Adherence

Quotes: 
No relevant quotes.

No details provided on measures to enforce or monitor adherence.

Score: [NA] 

Follow-up

Quotes:
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Examinations and questionnaires were completed prior to the first hippotherapy session (baseline), after 6–7 weeks (interim assessment) and after 12 weeks (final assessment).&quot;</span>

Follow-up assessments were done at baseline, 6 weeks, and 12 weeks. This frequency seems pragmatic and not excessive compared to what would be typical in practice.

Score: [4]

Primary outcome

Quotes:
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The primary endpoint was the change in the BBS (difference from BBS baseline to week 12).&quot;</span>

The Berg Balance Scale is a clinically meaningful outcome directly relevant to patients.

Score: [5] 

Primary analysis

Quotes:
<span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 97.3%):

Analyses were based on the modified intention-totreat set (modified ITT)' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;Analyses were based on the modified intention-to-treat set (modified ITT).&quot;</span> 

Use of an intention-to-treat analysis is a pragmatic approach to include all randomized participants.

<pre>
Here are the PRECIS-2 domain scores and explanations for the trial described in the publication <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Education for people with progressive neurological conditions can have negative effects: evidence from a randomized controlled trial&quot;</span>:

Eligibility criteria

Quotes:
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants eligible for inclusion were adults aged over 15 years with one of the following possible recorded diagnoses: MS, PD and other causes of progressive parkinsonism, motor neurone disease, Huntington's disease and other degenerative disorders affecting the central nervous system, muscles or peripheral nerves.&quot;</span>

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;In order to preserve a focus on primarily physical disabilities, dementing disorders such as Alzheimer's disease were not included.&quot;</span>  

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants whose clinical features appeared incompatible with the recorded diagnosis were excluded, as were those with neurological complications of primarily non-neurological conditions such as diabetes mellitus, or additional causes of severe disability.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The eligibility criteria seem quite broad, including adults over 15 years old with a range of progressive neurological conditions affecting movement and excluding only those with primary dementia or non-neurological causes of disability. This suggests a pragmatic approach allowing inclusion of typical patients who would receive the intervention in usual care.

Score: [4]

Recruitment

Quotes:
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;From July 1998 we approached the 177 GPs based within the City of Nottingham boundaries (population 282000).&quot;</span>  

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;We searched practice diagnostic lists and prescription records and made intensive enquiries for additional patients from individual GPs. To avoid ascertainment bias towards people already receiving specific health or social services, we used GP information as the sole method for identifying potential participants.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: Participants were identified systematically from GP records rather than through referral or self-referral. This routine recruitment through usual appointments or clinics without extra efforts suggests a pragmatic approach.

Score: [5] 

Setting

Quotes: 
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Thirty-six of 68 eligible practices (53%) agreed to take part and identified 438 patients. Of these, 342 were eligible and 116 (34%) consented; one was withdrawn because there was insufficient evidence of an eligible diagnosis, and one because a progressive neurological condition was not the major cause of disability.&quot;</span>

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;From July 1998 we approached the 177 GPs based within the City of Nottingham boundaries (population 282000).&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial was conducted in multiple general practices in a specific city, suggesting a typical care setting where results would apply. This pragmatic choice of setting matches usual care.

Score: [5]

Organization

Quotes:
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;In the education group (EG), baseline data were reviewed by an expert panel which advised on actions most likely to promote each individual's physical, social and psychological well-being. An occupational therapist (OT) then visited EG participants to provide education and information and to discuss a personalized 12-month health action plan.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: An expert panel provided input, but the intervention itself was delivered by an occupational therapist during a home visit, with no mention of extra staffing or resources. This expertise and organization seems consistent with usual care.

Score: [4] 

Flexibility: delivery

Quotes:
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;An occupational therapist (OT) then visited EG participants to provide education and information and to discuss a personalized 12-month health action plan.&quot;</span>

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Approximately two weeks later, EG participants received a single follow-through phone call from the research OT to confirm and reinforce the educational content of the visit, after which EG patients had no subsequent contact with the OT.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The education was personalized during the home visit, with flexibility in how it was delivered. No protocol is described beyond a single follow-up phone call. The pragmatic delivery matches usual care.

Score: [5]

Flexibility: adherence

Quotes: None relevant.

Reasoning: Adherence is not discussed, as the education intervention does not involve long-term adherence. This domain is not applicable.

Score: [NA]

Follow-up

Quotes:  
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Information on adverse events was collected by phone at two-monthly intervals between baseline and 12-month assessments, when a general enquiry was made without specific reference to falls or sores.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: Follow-up was limited to phone calls every 2 months with general inquiry, consistent with a pragmatic approach.

Score: [5]

Primary outcome

Quotes:
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Primary outcome measures were reports of one or more falls or skin sores. At interview, participants were asked 'In the past 12 months, have you fallen? Have you had a skin sore?'&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The primary outcomes of falls and skin sores are directly relevant adverse events for the participants. This is a pragmatic choice.

Score: [5] 

Primary analysis

Quotes:
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Logistic regression were performed&quot;</span> [...] <span title='Moderate quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 89.5%):

<pre>
Here are the PRECIS-2 assessments for the 9 domains based on the full text in "696.pdf":

Eligibility criteria:

Relevant quotes:

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Inclusion criteria consisted of: a diagnosis of relapsing MS according to McDonald criteria, being on natalizumab therapy for 24 months or longer, aged between 18 and 65 years and an EDSS score of ≤7.0.&quot;</span>

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Candidates were excluded from the study if active disease was identified at baseline per clinical ( presence of a relapse during the previous 30 days) and/or MRI evaluation (active gadolinium (Gd)-enhancing lesions).&quot;</span>

Reasoning: 

The inclusion criteria are reasonably broad, including all patients with relapsing MS who have been on natalizumab for at least 24 months. The age criteria of 18-65 years covers most adult patients. The EDSS ≤7.0 allows for patients with moderate disability. The main exclusion criteria is active disease at baseline, which is reasonable to ensure a more stable patient population. Overall, the eligibility seems fairly pragmatic.

Score: [4]

Recruitment:

Relevant quotes:

No relevant quotes found.

Reasoning: 

The paper does not provide any details on how patients were recruited, so it is difficult to assess this domain.

Score: [NA] 

Setting:

Relevant quotes:

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Fifty patients with relapsing MS, followed at the Jacobs MS Center for Treatment and Research, Department of Neurology, University at Buffalo, Buffalo New York, USA, were enrolled in this study.&quot;</span>

Reasoning:

The study was conducted at a single specialized MS center. This limits the generalizability of the findings.

Score: [2]

Organization:

Relevant quotes: 

No relevant quotes found.

Reasoning:

The paper does not provide any details on the expertise, resources, or organizational structure used to deliver the intervention.

Score: [NA]

Flexibility (delivery):

Relevant quotes:

No relevant quotes found.

Reasoning: 

The paper does not provide any details on the flexibility in delivering the intervention.

Score: [NA]

Flexibility (adherence): 

Relevant quotes:

No relevant quotes found.

Reasoning:

The paper does not mention any measures to enforce or monitor adherence. However, since this is a trial of drug discontinuation, adherence may not be as applicable.

Score: [NA]

Follow-up:

Relevant quotes:

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;A physical examination and neurological assessment was administered at baseline, 3, 6 and 12 months postdiscontinuation (counted from the last natalizumab infusion), as well as during unscheduled visits due to relapses (within 3–5 days of any new symptom development).&quot;</span>

<span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 99.3%):

Standardised MRI were performed using the same 3 T General Electric Signa Excite HD 12.0 (General Electric, Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA) right-handed scanner using a multichannel head and neck coil at baseline, 6 and 12 months following the discontinuation of natalizumab therapy.' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;Standardised MRI was performed using the same 3 T General Electric Signa Excite HD 12.0 (General Electric, Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA) right-handed scanner using a multichannel head and neck coil at baseline, 6 and 12 months following the discontinuation of natalizumab therapy.&quot;</span>

Reasoning:

Participants were followed regularly with clinical assessments every 3 months and MRI scans at baseline, 6 months and 12 months. Additional unscheduled visits were done for relapses. The frequency of follow-up seems more than typical clinical care.

Score: [2] 

Primary outcome:

Relevant quotes:

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Safety parameters evaluated as primary outcomes were defined as: (1) MRI parameters quantified by lesion activity analyses and changes in lesion volume (LV) and (2) clinical parameters that included the number of clinical relapses during the cessation period compared to the number of relapses before cessation in both the group as a whole as well as between the two randomised groups.&quot;</span>

Reasoning:

The co-primary outcomes of MRI lesion activity and clinical relapses are clinically meaningful to patients.

Score: [5]

Primary analysis:

Relevant quotes:

No relevant quotes found.

Reasoning: 

The paper does not provide details on the primary analysis population or handling of missing data.

Here are the PRECIS-2 scores and explanations for the trial described in "697.pdf":

Eligibility criteria 
Relevant quotes:
<span title='Major quote deviation, possible hallucination. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 74%):

Inclusion criteria were the following: diagnosis of MS made by a neurologist, able to walk 10 meters with or without an aid within 2 minutes, no relapse of their MS in the past 4 weeks, and no other' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: red'>&quot;Inclusion criteria were the following: diagnosis of MS made by a neurologist, able to walk 10 meters with or without an aid within 2 minutes, no relapse of their MS in the past 4 weeks, and no other neurological or orthopedic condition that would affect their function.&quot;</span>
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Eligible participants were excluded from the study if they were already engaged in a formal exercise program lasting >30 minutes twice per week, experienced an exacerbation within the past 4 weeks, had their MS immunomodulation medications altered in the previous 4 weeks or during the trial period, or declined to be randomly allocated.&quot;</span>

The eligibility criteria are reasonably broad, including MS patients with a range of disability levels who can walk at least 10 meters. However, patients with recent exacerbations or medication changes are excluded, as are those already engaged in exercise programs. This limits the trial population compared to patients who would receive the intervention in usual care.

Score: [3]

Recruitment
Relevant quotes:  
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Community dwelling people with MS were recruited through the Multiple Sclerosis Society of New South Wales and South Australia.&quot;</span>

Patients were recruited through a patient organization rather than during routine clinical visits. This requires some extra effort compared to recruiting patients who present for usual care.

Score: [2] 

Setting
Relevant quotes:
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The group program was conducted at a local community center and included four to six participants per class.&quot;</span>
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Home exercise participants were provided with one center-based physiotherapist-led session at the commencement of the intervention period for training, and telephone support by a physiotherapist to discuss their program every 2 weeks.&quot;</span>

The setting includes both a community center and in patients' homes. The community center represents a typical real-world setting where group exercise would occur. Home settings are also highly pragmatic. 

Score: [5]

Organization
Relevant quotes:
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Groups were led by a physiotherapist employed by the Multiple Sclerosis Society who received training to ensure a standard approach to intervention, intensity, and progression.&quot;</span>

A physiotherapist led the groups, which represents resources available in real-world settings. No extensive additional training or certification was required.

Score: [4] 

Flexibility: delivery
Relevant quotes:
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Guidelines were provided to physiotherapists and participants for exercises to be adapted and progressed to suit individual functional ability via increasing repetitions, amplitude of movement, speed of movement, and modifying base of support.&quot;</span>

The exercises were tailored and progressed for each participant, with flexibility similar to usual care.

Score: [4]

Flexibility: adherence
Relevant quotes:
No measures to enforce adherence are described.

Participants' adherence was self-directed, as in usual care.

Score: [5]

Follow-up
Relevant quotes:  
<span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 99%):

Outcome assessments were conducted at baseline, immediately postintervention and at 8-week follow-up.' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;Outcome assessments were conducted at baseline, immediately post-intervention and at 8-week follow-up.&quot;</span>

Follow-up assessments were done at baseline, post-intervention, and 8 weeks after completion. This schedule is very similar to what would occur in usual practice.

Score: [4]

Primary outcome
Relevant quotes:
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The primary outcome measure was gait speed, measured using the 10-meter walk test.&quot;</span> 

The 10-meter walk test is a direct measure of gait speed that is clinically meaningful for patients.

Score: [5] 

Primary analysis
Relevant quotes:  
<span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 96.9%):

Data were analyzed according to the intention-totreat principle' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;Data were analyzed according to the intention-to-treat principle.&quot;</span>

An intention-to-treat analysis was used, including all randomized participants. This is consistent with a pragmatic approach.

publication full text</span> (mean similarity 99.8%)</i></p>
<pre>
Here are the PRECIS-2 scores and explanations for the 9 domains based on the full text:

Eligibility criteria:

Relevant quotes:

<span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 99.1%):

Eligible participants were male 35–65 yr old with a BMI of Q28 kgIm j2 and met PA safety requirements (i.e., no risk indicated by the Physical Activity Readiness Questionnaire [36] or clearance from a health care provider).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;Eligible participants were male 35–65 yr old with a BMI of ≥28 kg/m2 and met PA safety requirements (i.e., no risk indicated by the Physical Activity Readiness Questionnaire [36] or clearance from a health care provider).&quot;</span>

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Age and BMI restrictions reflect evidence suggesting the following: 1) overweight/obese men in their mid-30s may experience an attitudinal shift in relation to their health, increasing their receptiveness to change health behaviors, and 2) men who are obese or at risk for becoming obese are more likely to want to lose weight (16).&quot;</span>

Explanation: The eligibility criteria are fairly broad, including overweight and obese men aged 35-65 years old who met basic PA safety requirements. The age and BMI restrictions aim to target men who may be receptive to changing health behaviors and wanting to lose weight. This aligns with men who would receive this intervention in usual care.

Score: [4] Rather pragmatic

Recruitment:

Relevant quotes:  

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Recruitment occurred using a variety of methods (e.g., hockey team e-mail blasts and social media accounts, study Web site (http://hockeyfansintraining.org/), posters, traditional media advertisements, word of mouth, direct contact at team arena).&quot;</span>

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Across both sites, the most successful methods of recruitment included communication from the hockey team via e-mail or social media (e.g., Twitter) and word of mouth, where 40% and 36% of men were recruited, respectively.&quot;</span>

Explanation: Participants were recruited through communication methods regularly used by the hockey teams, such as email, social media, and word of mouth. Some additional methods like posters, websites, and traditional media were used, likely to boost recruitment numbers, but the most successful methods align with how participants would learn about the program in a real-world setting.

Score: [4] Rather pragmatic  

Setting:

Relevant quotes: 

<span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 99.3%):

We used a pragmatic approach for the program venue at each site, using a combination of the hockey team_s arena and an affiliated health club facility.' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;We used a pragmatic approach for the program venue at each site, using a combination of the hockey team’s arena and an affiliated health club facility.&quot;</span>

Explanation: The program venues included the hockey team arenas and affiliated health club facilities. This matches real-world settings where the intervention would be delivered as part of usual care.

Score: [5] Very pragmatic

Organization:

Relevant quotes:

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Twelve-week active phase. The Hockey FIT program was delivered over 12 weekly, 90-min sessions by Hockey FIT coaches (coach to participant ratio 2:20) from the central research team.&quot;</span> 

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;At the start of the program, more time was allocated to classroom education, but as the program progressed, more time was spent on group-based exercise.&quot;</span>

Explanation: The program was delivered by Hockey FIT coaches brought in by the research team, rather than the teams' existing coaching staff. This differs from usual care where the program would likely be delivered by the teams' existing staff. More organization and resources were required than would be typical for program delivery in a real-world setting.

Score: [2] Rather explanatory

Flexibility (delivery):

Relevant quotes:

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;In the development of Hockey FIT, specific adaptations to FFIT included modifying program content to the North American context (e.g., language used in relation to education on healthy eating) and to hockey in particular (e.g., for the exercise component, off-ice hockey-related drills and conditioning exercises were incorporated).&quot;</span>

Explanation: The delivery of the program was adapted to the local context, but followed a standardized curriculum. There was little flexibility in how the intervention was delivered. This is more explanatory compared to usual care where providers may have more discretion.

Score: [2] Rather explanatory

Flexibility (adherence): 

Relevant quote: 

<span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 99.6%):

Regarding program compliance, there were 10 men in the intervention group who were classified as ‘‘noncompleters’’ (i.e., attended G50% of sessions including none in the final 6 wk), but this did not preclude them from attending follow-up measurement sessions.' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;Regarding program compliance, there were 10 men in the intervention group who were classified as ‘noncompleters’ (i.e., attended <50% of sessions including none in the final 6 wk), but this did not preclude them from attending follow-up measurement sessions.&quot;</span>

Explanation: There was no specific exclusion criteria or measures based on participant adherence. Participants were able to continue in the study regardless of their compliance with the program. This matches the flexibility around adherence that would occur in usual care.

Score: [5] Very pragmatic

Follow-up:

Relevant quote:

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Follow-up occurred at 12 wk (both groups) and 12 months (intervention group only to explore the sustainability of long-term change).&quot;</span>

Explanation: Follow-up was limited to 12 weeks and 12 months. This does not seem more frequent or intense than would occur for weight management programs in usual care.

Score: [4] Rather pragmatic

Primary outcome:

Relevant quote: 

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Briefly, we conducted a pilot, pragmatic randomized controlled trial (pRCT; parallel groups, stratified by site) in Ontario, Canada. Eighty male fans of two ice hockey teams from the Ontario Hockey League (40 men from each of London and Sarnia) were recruited and randomized to either intervention (Hockey FIT) or comparator (wait-list control).&quot;</span>

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The planned primary outcome for the definitive trial was the difference between groups in mean weight loss (kg) and percentage weight change from baseline to 12 wk.&quot;</span>

Explanation: The primary outcome was weight loss in kilograms, which is a clinically meaningful outcome that is relevant and important to participants in weight management programs. This matches usual care.

Score: [5] Very pragmatic

Primary analysis:

Relevant quote: 

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;We analyzed outcome data to examine the potential effectiveness of the Hockey FIT program on the basis of an intent-to-treat approach.&quot;</span>

Explanation: An intent-to-treat analysis was used, including all randomized participants regardless of compliance or adherence. This matches the analysis approach that would be used in usual care.

Score: [5] Very pragmatic</pre>

publication full text</span> (mean similarity 99.1%)</i></p>
<pre>
Here are the PRECIS-2 scores and justifications for each domain based on the full text in "712.pdf":

Eligibility criteria:

Relevant quotes:

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;We selected 156 pregnant women in their ≥ 37 week/s, who had cervical dilations of ≥ 4 cm and with two or more contractions in 10 minutes.&quot;</span>

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Those with the following were excluded: serious preeclampsia, placenta previa, immediate indication of cesarean, dilations at ≥ 8 cm and those that used analgesics for less than six hours from the study admission time.&quot;</span> 

Reasoning: The inclusion criteria target pregnant women in active labor, which matches the population who would receive acupressure for labor pain in real-world practice. The exclusions for safety reasons and advanced labor would also apply in usual care. However, excluding those who recently used analgesics makes the sample less representative of real-world practice.

Score: [3] 

Recruitment:

Relevant quotes: No relevant quotes provided. The participants were recruited at a university hospital. 

Reasoning: The recruitment process is not described. Recruiting at a single university hospital likely makes the sample less diverse and representative than recruiting more broadly across multiple centers and care settings. However, without more details, it's unclear how pragmatic or explanatory the recruitment process was.  

Score: [NA]

Setting: 

Relevant quote: <span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 95.4%):

was carried out between January and August of 2013. The subjects were pregnant women admitted to a teaching tertiary public hospital on the outskirts of the state of Sao Paulo, Brazil.' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;The study was carried out between January and August of 2013. The subjects were pregnant women admitted to a teaching tertiary public hospital on the outskirts of the state of Sao Paulo, Brazil.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The study was conducted at a single teaching hospital, which does not reflect the diversity of settings where the intervention would be implemented in real-world practice. This makes the setting rather explanatory.

Score: [2]

Organisation:

Relevant quotes: No relevant quotes provided.

Reasoning: The paper does not provide any details about the expertise, resources, or care delivery model used to administer the intervention. Without more information, the score cannot be assessed.

Score: [NA]  

Flexibility (delivery):

Relevant quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;For conducting evaluations on the pain we opted for the VAS model which is a rising scale from 0 10, 0 meaning no pain to 10 which is the worst pain felt.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The delivery of the acupressure intervention seems standardized based on using a scale to apply consistent pressure. However, details are lacking on how rigidly it was protocolized. The flexibility of delivery remains unclear. 

Score: [NA]

Flexibility (adherence): 

Relevant quotes: No relevant quotes provided.

Reasoning: The paper does not mention any measures to enforce or monitor adherence to the acupressure intervention. However, details are lacking to fully assess flexibility of adherence.

Score: [NA]

Follow-up:

Relevant quotes: 

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;VAS was used and reused immediately after the treatment (VAS20) and 60 minutes after the treatment, once consent had been given by the pregnant women in labor to participate in the study.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: Follow-up is limited to two time points - 20 minutes and 60 minutes after the intervention. This matches what would occur in usual care and does not constitute intensive measurement.

Score: [4] 

Primary outcome:

Relevant quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;For conducting evaluations on the pain we opted for the VAS model which is a rising scale from 0 10, 0 meaning no pain to 10 which is the worst pain felt.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The primary outcome is self-reported pain using the VAS scale. This outcome is highly relevant to patients and can be easily implemented in real-world settings.

Score: [5]

Primary analysis:

Relevant quotes: No relevant quotes provided. 

Reasoning: The analysis methods are not described to determine if an intention-to-treat approach was used.

Here are the PRECIS-2 scores and explanations for the 9 domains based on the full text in "713.pdf":

Eligibility criteria:

Relevant quotes:

<span title='Moderate quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 93.3%):

No criteria were set for family members accompanying the patients.' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ff9e81'>&quot;Patients, 45-65 years old, with mild and moderate COPD (grade II and III) as the primary disease. No criteria were set for family members accompanying the patients.&quot;</span> 

<span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 99.8%):

The stage of COPD was determined at entry into the study based on a post-bronchodilator spirometry test, using a calibrated digital hand-held spirometer, showing a forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV 1 )/forced vital capacity (FVC) ratio of less than 07 with the stages of the disease referring to the following: GOLD I was FEV 1 ≥ 80% predicted, GOLD II was 50% ≤ FEV 1 < 80% predicted, GOLD III referred to 30% ≤ FEV 1 < 50% and GOLD IV to <30% FEV' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;The stage of COPD was determined at entry into the study based on a post-bronchodilator spirometry test, using a calibrated digital hand-held spirometer, showing a forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1)/forced vital capacity (FVC) ratio of less than 0.7 with the stages of the disease referring to the following: GOLD I was FEV1 ≥ 80% predicted, GOLD II was 50% ≤ FEV1 < 80% predicted, GOLD III referred to 30% ≤ FEV1 < 50% and GOLD IV to <30% FEV1.&quot;</span>

<span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 99.5%):

Excluded were individuals who had another major disease (among them individuals with asthma who had more than 200 ml or 12% increase in FEV 1 after inhalation of 200 lg albuterol in the postbronchodilator spirometry), who were non-Icelandic speaking, not capable of travelling to the treatment site and those who had participated in a structured rehabilitation programme for people with COPD 6 months prior to the screening.' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;Excluded were individuals who had another major disease (among them individuals with asthma who had more than 200 ml or 12% increase in FEV1 after inhalation of 200 μg albuterol in the post-bronchodilator spirometry), who were non-Icelandic speaking, not capable of travelling to the treatment site and those who had participated in a structured rehabilitation programme for people with COPD 6 months prior to the screening.&quot;</span>

Reasoning:

The eligibility criteria focus on patients with mild to moderate COPD (GOLD stages II and III), which matches the target population for the intervention. Patients with other major diseases are excluded, which is reasonable. Overall, the criteria seem pragmatic and do not appear to make the trial population very different from real-world patients.

Score: [4]

Recruitment:

Relevant quotes:

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;An invitation letter signed by the patient’s physician was sent to potential participants explaining that the study was a clinical, family trial and that as a client of the physician, the person had been identified as a possible participant and that in addition, participation by a close family member was requested.&quot;</span>

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;One to two weeks later the patient was contacted by phone. In the phone call, possibilities for participation were explored. An appointment at the research centre was set up for those who accepted the invitation.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: 

Patients were recruited directly from their regular physicians, which matches real-world practice. While the invitation letter and phone call represent additional recruitment effort, this seems fairly pragmatic overall.

Score: [4] 

Setting:

Relevant quotes:

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;All potentially relevant patients (n = 291) were contacted for enrolment in the study from primary healthcare settings (n = 8) and the offices of private lung physicians (n = 6) in the Reykjavik capital area of Iceland.&quot;</span>

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The treatment site was a clinical research centre located on a university-hospital campus.&quot;</span>

Reasoning:

Patients were identified and recruited from their regular primary care and physician offices, reflecting a real-world setting. While the treatment was delivered at a research center, this still seems reasonably pragmatic.

Score: [4]

Organization:

Relevant quotes: 

No clear information provided on organization.

Reasoning: 

The text does not provide details on the expertise, resources, or organizational model used to deliver the intervention.

Score: [NA]

Flexibility of experimental intervention - delivery:

Relevant quotes:

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Attempt to understand the health situation. Key question: What are your main concerns about the health of the person with the lung disease? (Jonsdottir et al. 2004a). Followed by conversations about: a) Existence of the lung disease and symptoms that the patient has in the context of everyday life of patient and family.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: 

The delivery of the intervention through semi-structured conversations allows flexibility based on the patient's individual situation and concerns. This matches real-world practice.

Score: [5]

Flexibility of experimental intervention - adherence:

Relevant quotes:

No clear information provided on adherence.

Reasoning: 

The text does not mention any specific strategies to enforce or monitor adherence. This suggests a pragmatic approach but details are lacking.

Score: [NA]  

Follow-up:

Relevant quotes:

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Data were collected at baseline and at month 12. Additionally, data collection was carried out in the experimental group at month 6 after the last treatment session.&quot;</span>

Reasoning:

Follow-up data collection at 0, 6, and 12 months represents more contact than usual care but does not seem overly intensive. The frequency seems appropriate to capture outcomes.

Score: [4]

Primary outcome: 

Relevant quotes:

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;St. George’s Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ-C) is an HRQL instrument, specially designed for people with breathing problems (Jones 2002, 2008). In its shortened version it contains 40 items with Likert-type and dichotomous questions, which are aggregated into a total score and three subscales: symptoms; activity and impact.&quot;</span>

Reasoning:

The SGRQ is a standard, validated instrument for assessing quality of life in COPD patients. This matches real-world practice and is highly relevant to patients.

Score: [5]

Primary analysis:

Relevant quotes: 

No clear information provided on primary analysis.

Reasoning: 

The text does not provide details on the primary analysis method.

<pre>
Here are the PRECIS-2 scores for the clinical trial in the attached paper "714.pdf":

Eligibility criteria:

Relevant quotes: 
<span title='Major quote deviation, possible hallucination. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 63.9%):

From their computerised asthma registers the practices identified adults (>18 years) who had asked for a bronchodilator inhaler prescription in the prev' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: red'>&quot;From their computerised asthma registers the practices identified adults (>18 years) who had asked for a bronchodilator inhaler prescription in the prevous six months but who had not had a routine asthma review in the preceding 11 months.&quot;</span>
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Patients were excluded if the diagnosis of asthma had been made within the previous year, if they had chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, if communication difficulties made a telephone consultation impossible, or (at the general practitioner’s request) for major social or medical reasons.&quot;</span>

The eligibility criteria are fairly broad, including adults with asthma who have received a bronchodilator prescription in the past 6 months. The main exclusions are for comorbidities like COPD or major social/medical issues, which seem reasonable for a pragmatic trial aiming to assess effectiveness under usual conditions. While some patients like those with communication difficulties are excluded, this is necessary for a telephone consultation trial. Overall, the criteria seem reasonably similar to those used in usual care.

Score: [4]

Recruitment:

Relevant quotes:
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;We wrote to all eligible patients inviting them to take part in the study.&quot;</span> 

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Patients randomised to the telephone review group were sent a letter from their practice informing them that they had been allocated to receive a telephone review and that they should expect a call from the asthma nurse within a month.&quot;</span>

Patients were recruited by letter invitation rather than during usual appointments. This involves some extra effort beyond usual care. However, letters are still a reasonably feasible recruitment method for practices.

Score: [3] 

Setting:

Relevant quotes:
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;All four general practices that took part in the study had nurses who were trained and experienced in providing proactive asthma care.&quot;</span>

The setting is multiple general practices providing routine asthma care. This matches the setting where the intervention would be applied in usual practice.

Score: [5]

Organisation:

Relevant quotes: 
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The nurses were given no instructions about the content of the review except that it should reflect their normal practice and be appropriate to each patient’s clinical need.&quot;</span>

The resources and expertise used to deliver the intervention appear very similar to usual care. The nurses conducted the reviews as part of their normal practice without additional training or instructions beyond routine care.

Score: [5]  

Flexibility of Experimental Intervention - Delivery:

Relevant quotes:
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The nurses were given no instructions about the content of the review except that it should reflect their normal practice and be appropriate to each patient’s clinical need.&quot;</span>

The nurses had full flexibility to deliver the telephone consultation as per their normal practice, with no strict protocol. This matches the flexibility expected in usual care.

Score: [5]

Flexibility of Experimental Intervention - Adherence:

Relevant quotes: 
No discussion of specific measures to enforce patient adherence.

There is no indication that the researchers monitored or enforced patient adherence to the intervention. Encouragement to adhere is likely similar to usual care.

Score: [5] 

Follow-up:

Relevant quotes:
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Follow up questionnaires on morbidity and satisfaction with the consultation were sent to the patients at three months.&quot;</span>

Follow-up was limited to questionnaires sent at 3 months, with no additional in-person visits. This is minimal follow-up similar to usual care.

Score: [5]

Primary outcome:

Relevant quotes:  
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Primary outcome measures were the proportion of participants who were reviewed within three months of randomisation and disease specific quality of life, as measured by the Juniper mini asthma quality of life questionnaire.&quot;</span>

The outcomes of review rate and quality of life are highly patient-centered and important to participants in assessing an asthma intervention.

Score: [5]

Primary analysis:

Relevant quotes:
No details provided on primary analysis method.

There is no mention of the analysis method used. However, nothing indicates that participants were excluded or data was missing.

publication full text</span> (mean similarity 98.1%)</i></p>
<pre>
Here are the PRECIS-2 domain scores and reasoning based on the full text in 715.pdf:

Eligibility criteria:

Relevant quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The inclusion criteria were: a positive diagnosis of RA (1987 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria), age 18 years or older and the ability to complete questionnaires unaided.&quot;</span>
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Exclusions were: unstabilised concomitant disease, awaiting surgery and already receiving care from the practitioners involved in the study.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The inclusion criteria match the intended population - adults with RA who would be candidates for nurse-led care in usual practice. The exclusions seem reasonable and aim to avoid confounding. Overall, the eligibility criteria appear pragmatic.

Score: [4] 

Recruitment:

Relevant quotes:  
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;After gaining patient consent, demographics and disease activity score in 28 joints (DAS28), patients were randomly assigned using a remote secure telephone randomisation service provided by Leeds University Clinical Trials Research Unit.&quot;</span>
- <span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 97.7%):

The study was conducted in outpatient clinics of 10 rheumatology centres across the UK.' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;This study was conducted in outpatient clinics of 10 rheumatology centres across the UK.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: Patients were recruited through rheumatology clinics, which matches the intended setting. Conducting the trial across multiple centers increases generalizability. No extra efforts beyond usual care are mentioned. Recruitment seems fairly pragmatic.

Score: [4]

Setting: 

Relevant quotes:  
- <span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 97.7%):

The study was conducted in outpatient clinics of 10 rheumatology centres across the UK.' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;This study was conducted in outpatient clinics of 10 rheumatology centres across the UK.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial was conducted in routine rheumatology outpatient clinics, which matches the intended real-world care setting. Using multiple centers enhances generalizability. The setting seems pragmatic.

Score: [5] 

Organization:

Relevant quotes:
- <span title='Moderate quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 88.2%):

- <span title='Moderate quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 91.8%):

min. NLC had longer consultations (median 20 min, IQR=15–30 vs RLC, 15,' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ff9e81'>&quot;NLC had longer consultations (median 20 min, IQR=15–30 vs RLC, 15, 10–15)&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The care seems to have been provided with existing staffing and resources, without major changes beyond slightly longer consultation times for NLC. However, RLC patients received more biological agents over time, which may have favored that group. Overall, organization appears moderately pragmatic.

Score: [3]

Flexibility (delivery):

Relevant quotes: 
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The CNS have experience in running nurse-led clinics and usually have a postgraduate qualification in rheumatology nursing and/or prescribing.&quot;</span>
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The role components of NLC include an assessment of disease activity, monitoring effects of therapy, prescribing or recommending medication or dosage changes including intramuscular/intra-articular steroid injections, provision of patient education, psychological support, providing patients with a contactable knowledgeable and accessible professional through telephone advice lines, coordinating complex care and referring to other health professionals.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The nurses were experienced in nurse-led clinics, but no strict protocol is mentioned. The delivery seems flexible and tailored to individual patients' needs, as in usual care. This domain appears pragmatic.

Score: [5]

Flexibility (adherence):

Relevant quotes:
- No discussion of measures to enforce or monitor adherence.

Reasoning: There is no evidence of special efforts to ensure adherence beyond what would occur in usual care. However, adherence is not explicitly discussed. I will mark this domain as not applicable based on the available information.

Score: [NA]  

Follow-up:

Relevant quotes:  
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Patients were seen by their respective practitioners at baseline and at weeks 13, 26, 39 and 52.&quot;</span>
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Independent assessors were health professionals trained to perform joint counts and calculating the DAS28.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: Follow-up visits matched the trial protocol, which was more frequent than usual care. However, outcomes were assessed by independent clinicians in a way that resembles usual practice. Follow-up seems moderately pragmatic.

Score: [3]

Primary outcome:

Relevant quotes:  
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The primary outcome was DAS28 and secondary outcomes were pain severity (pain-VAS), fatigue (fatigue-VAS) and duration of morning stiffness measured at each study visit.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: DAS28 is a standard outcome directly relevant to patients. The primary outcome seems pragmatic.

Score: [5]

Primary analysis:

Relevant quotes: 
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Analysis followed per-protocol (PP) and intention-to-treat (ITT) approaches.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The analysis included all randomized patients and followed ITT principles. This seems consistent with a pragmatic approach.

Here are the PRECIS-2 scores for the trial in the attached publication "722.pdf":

Eligibility criteria:
Relevant quotes:  
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Men and women aged ≥18 years at high CVD risk, defined as either established CVD (history of coronary, ischaemic cerebrovascular, or peripheral vascular disease) or an estimated five-year CVD risk of ≥15% (using the Framingham risk equation, including a 5% increment for Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander identification) were eligible.&quot;</span>

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Each participant had to have, in their doctor’s view, indications for all and no contraindications to any component of at least one of two polypills – version 1 (containing aspirin 75 mg, simvastatin 40 mg, lisinopril 10 mg, atenolol 50 mg) or version 2 (containing aspirin 75 mg, simvastatin 40 mg, lisinopril 10 mg, hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg).&quot;</span>

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants were excluded if it was felt clinically inappropriate to alter medications.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The eligibility criteria are fairly broad, including adults at high CVD risk based on established disease or a risk score. The main exclusion criterion is if the treating physician felt it was inappropriate to alter medications, which seems reasonable. No patients were excluded based on expected adherence or responsiveness. Overall, the criteria seem pragmatic and aim to recruit a representative sample of patients who would receive the intervention in real-world practice.

Score: [4]

Recruitment:
Relevant quotes:
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;We conducted a randomized, open-label trial involving 623 participants from Australian general practices.&quot;</span> 

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Ethics approval was granted by appropriate committees in all relevant jurisdictions and each participant provided written informed consent.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: Patients were recruited from general practices, which is where they would seek care and be treated for CVD in routine practice. No special recruitment efforts beyond engaging patients at general practices are mentioned.

Score: [4] 

Setting:
Relevant quotes:
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;We conducted a randomized, open-label trial involving 623 participants from Australian general practices.&quot;</span>

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The protocol has been published.&quot;</span> 

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;All participants were treated by their regular doctor following randomization. No attempt was made to influence the management of usual care participants.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial was conducted in Australian general practices, which matches the setting where the intervention would be delivered in routine care. Patients received care from their regular doctors. No mention of just specialized centers. Seems reasonably pragmatic.

Score: [4]

Organization: 
Relevant quotes:
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;All participants were treated by their regular doctor following randomization.&quot;</span>

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;No attempt was made to influence the management of usual care participants. Those allocated to the polypill-based strategy were prescribed one of the polypill versions at the discretion of their doctor, to be taken at a time suggested by the doctor.&quot;</span> 

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Prescription and dispensing of the polypill occurred in the same way as for other medications.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: Patients received care from their regular doctors with no additional staff or training. Prescription and dispensing of medications including the polypill followed standard procedures. The organization of care delivery matches usual practice.

Score: [5] 

Flexibility of experimental intervention - delivery:
Relevant quotes:
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;No attempt was made to influence any other aspect of their management. The doctor could, at any time, change prescription to the alternative polypill version, add drugs on top of the polypill, or withdraw the polypill and substitute individual drugs of their choice.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: Doctors had flexibility in delivering the intervention including switching polypill versions, adding other drugs, or withdrawing the polypill. No strict protocol is described. Delivery flexibility matches usual practice.

Score: [5]

Flexibility of experimental intervention - adherence:
Relevant quotes:
No relevant quotes found.

Reasoning: No mention of specific efforts to monitor or enforce adherence. Likely matches usual practice but insufficient information to score definitively. 

Score: [NA] 

Follow-up:
Relevant quotes:  
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants attended the primary healthcare centres for trial assessments at randomization and 12 month intervals thereafter. All participants were also reviewed one month post-randomization and at intervening six month intervals, but these could be conducted by telephone.&quot;</span>

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;BP (measured with the Omron 705CP II device) and fasting lipids (measured at local laboratories) levels were obtained at baseline, 12 months, 24 months and the final visit.&quot;</span> 

Reasoning: Follow-up schedule includes visits at baseline, 1 month, 6 months, 12 months, 18 months, and end of study. This seems slightly more frequent than usual care but reasonably pragmatic. Assessments focused on BP and lipids.

Score: [4]

Primary outcome: 
Relevant quotes:
<span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 98.3%):

Primary outcomes were self-reported use of indicated combination treatment (antiplatelet, statin and 2 BP lowering therapies for 4 of the previous seven days) at study end; and changes in systolic BP and total cholesterol from baseline to study end.' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;Primary outcomes were self-reported combination treatment use (antiplatelet, statin and ≥2 BP lowering therapies for ≥4 of the previous seven days) at study end; and changes in systolic BP and total cholesterol from baseline to study end.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The primary outcomes of medication adherence, systolic BP, and total cholesterol are clinically relevant to patients and important treatment targets.  

Score: [5]

Primary analysis:
Relevant quotes: 
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;All analyses were conducted on an intention-to-treat basis without imputation of missing data.&quot;</span>

Here are the PRECIS-2 scores and justifications for the trial based on the full text:

Eligibility criteria

Relevant quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Patients were eligible for inclusion if they were aged 16 years or older and presented within 3 weeks after sustaining a displaced fracture of the proximal humerus that involved the surgical neck.&quot;</span>
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Excluded patients had associated dislocation of the injured shoulder joint, open fracture, insufficient mental capacity to understand the trial or instructions for rehabilitation, comorbidities precluding surgery or anesthesia, clear indication for surgery such as severe soft-tissue compromise, multiple injuries (upper limb fractures), pathological fracture (other than osteoporotic), terminal illness, or were not a resident in the hospital catchment area.&quot;</span>

The eligibility criteria are reasonably pragmatic - patients of all adult ages who present with a displaced proximal humerus fracture are included, which reflects the population likely to receive the intervention in usual care. Patients with comorbidities precluding surgery are excluded, which is appropriate as they would not be surgical candidates in usual care. Overall, the criteria reasonably match usual care.

Score: [4] 

Recruitment:

Relevant quotes:  
- <span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Patients were recruited via a postal questionnaire to identify symptoms and trial eligibility, not just to invite to participate.&quot;</span>

The recruitment path is somewhat explanatory - patients were identified via questionnaires sent to primary care practices rather than presenting to clinics directly, which does not reflect how they would access care in usual practice. This recruitment method likely biases the sample toward healthier/more motivated patients.

Score: [2]

Setting:

Relevant quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Patients were followed up for 2 years (up to April 2013) and 215 had complete follow-up data. The data for 231 patients (114 in surgical group and 117 in nonsurgical group) were included in the primary analysis.&quot;</span> 
- <span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 99.3%):

33 hospitals routinely provide surgical and nonsurgical fracture treatment. Patients received their allocated treatment from the recruiting hospital.' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;33 hospitals rountinely provide surgical and nonsurgical fracture treatment. Patients received their allocated treatment from the recruiting hospital.&quot;</span>

The setting is pragmatic - patients were recruited and treated at 33 different acute NHS hospitals across the UK that routinely provide standard proximal humerus fracture care. The setting matches usual practice.

Score: [5] 

Organization:

Relevant quotes:
- <span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 99%):

Care pathways for all patients included outpatientand community-based rehabilitation, which primarily comprised 1 or more 1-on-1 sessions with a physiotherapist that focused on restoring function.' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;Care pathways for all patients included outpatient- and community-based rehabilitation, which primarily comprised 1 or more 1-on-1 sessions with a physiotherapist that focused on restoring function.&quot;</span>
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Consistent with the study protocol, 29 of 32 recruiting centers (91%) recommended 3 or more weeks of sling use.&quot;</span>

The organization is reasonably pragmatic - patients received standard rehabilitation care through existing community physiotherapy services. The resources and expertise appear consistent with usual practice.

Score: [4]

Flexibility (delivery):

Relevant quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;It was emphasized that good standards of care, both surgical and nonsurgical, should be provided throughout the treatment pathway for the injury, including surgical care or management of the sling, postoperative care, and rehabilitation in both groups.&quot;</span>
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;To avoid learning curve problems, surgeons and physiotherapists used surgical interventions and procedures with which they were familiar.&quot;</span> 

The flexibility of delivery is pragmatic - the protocol emphasizes using good standard of care and familiar procedures, allowing flexibility in how the intervention is delivered as per usual practice.

Score: [5]

Flexibility (adherence): 

Relevant quotes: None

There is no mention of measures to enforce or monitor adherence. As this is a surgical trial, adherence is not applicable post-consent and treatment.   

Score: [NA]

Follow-up:

Relevant quotes:  
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Follow-up was up to 2 years (until April 2013) for all patients.&quot;</span>
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Data collection was via hospital forms (baseline characteristics and details of surgery, details of inpatient stay, treatment confirmation at 1 month, physiotherapy and end of physiotherapy, 1-year and 2-year follow-up, and adverse events and review)&quot;</span>

The 2 year follow-up period is longer than usual care. Data collection seems more extensive than usual care. Overall, the follow-up intensity is somewhat explanatory.

Score: [2]

Primary outcome:

Relevant quotes:  
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Primary outcome was the Oxford Shoulder Score (range, 0-48; higher scores indicate better outcomes) assessed during a 2-year period, with assessment and data collection at 6, 12, and 24 months.&quot;</span>

The Oxford Shoulder Score is a patient-reported measure of shoulder function and pain, which is a pragmatic and clinically meaningful primary outcome for patients.

Score: [5]

Primary analysis:

Relevant quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Analyses followed a prespecified analysis plan, endorsed by the data monitoring and ethics committee, and were performed using Stata version 12 (StataCorp). All analyses were on an intention-to-treat basis and included all randomized patients in the groups to which they were randomized.&quot;</span>

The analysis is pragmatic - it followed an intention-to-treat approach including all randomized patients.

publication full text</span> (mean similarity 100%)</i></p>
<pre>
Here are the PRECIS-2 scores and explanations for the clinical trial described in the attached paper "733.pdf":

Eligibility criteria:

Relevant quotes:

"Patients aged ≥65 years were identified by searches of computerised medical records and invited to participate by letter from their GP. Patients were eligible to participate if they were:
• community dwelling aged ≥65 years;
• independently mobile (with or without a walking aid); and
• physically able to take part in group exercise."

"Patients were excluded if they:
• had experienced ≥3 falls in the previous year; 
• had unstable clinical conditions;
• would be unable to follow instructions about exercise safely; or
• were receiving palliative care."

Explanation: The eligibility criteria are quite broad, including all community-dwelling adults aged 65+ who are mobile and can participate in group exercise. The exclusions are reasonable and aim to protect participant safety. Overall, the criteria seem to target a population reasonably similar to who would receive the intervention in usual care.

Score: [4] 

Recruitment:  

Relevant quotes:

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Practices were recruited with assistance from Primary Care Research Networks for London, Derby, and Nottingham. Patients aged ≥65 years were identified by searches of computerised medical records and invited to participate by letter from their GP.&quot;</span>

Explanation: Participants were recruited through their primary care providers, who searched medical records to identify eligible patients and invite them to participate. This process seems very similar to how patients would be identified and recruited for this intervention in a real-world primary care setting. No extraordinary recruitment efforts are mentioned.

Score: [5]

Setting:

Relevant quotes: 

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;A three-arm, parallel-design cluster controlled trial was used, with allocation at the level of general practice in two centres (London and Nottingham/Derby).&quot;</span>

Explanation: The trial was conducted in general practice settings in two regions of the UK. This matches the intended real-world setting, as the interventions are meant for delivery in primary care. No specialty clinics or academic centers were used.

Score: [5] 

Organization:

Relevant quotes:

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The FaME intervention took place in a group once a week and included exercises to be carried out at home, unsupervised, twice weekly.&quot;</span> 

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Volunteer peer mentors supported participants in the OEP arm, and weekly FaME classes were run in local venues by postural stability instructors trained to work with older people.&quot;</span>

Explanation: The interventions were delivered by postural stability instructors and volunteer peer mentors, suggesting no extra clinical expertise was required compared to usual care. Classes took place in local community venues. Overall, the expertise, resources, and organization seem very similar to what would be available in usual primary care.

Score: [5]

Flexibility - delivery:

Relevant quotes:

"The FaME programme included the following progression:
• OEP — ankle weights and hand holds; and
• FaME — resistance bands and hand holds, plus a move to more dynamic balance work and floor work with postural stability instructors."

Explanation: The exercises and their progression are specified in the protocol, suggesting limited flexibility in delivery. However, some tailoring seems to occur based on individual capabilities. And overall, the protocols do not seem overly prescriptive compared to what exercise interventions would entail in usual care.

Score: [4] 

Flexibility - adherence:

No relevant quotes.

Explanation: No measures to enforce or monitor adherence are mentioned. Patients seem free to follow the intervention as closely as they wish, as would occur in usual care.

Score: [5] 

Follow-up:

Relevant quotes:

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants were followed up every 6 months after the end of the intervention period, until 24 months.&quot;</span>

Explanation: Follow-up was 6-monthly to assess outcomes. This seems somewhat more frequent than usual care, but is likely necessary for research purposes. Importantly, the follow-up does not seem to affect delivery of the intervention itself.

Score: [4]

Primary outcome: 

Relevant quotes:

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The primary outcome was the proportion reaching the recommended physical activity target 12 months post-intervention.&quot;</span> 

Explanation: The primary outcome is minutes of moderate-vigorous physical activity. This is a direct, objective measure of physical activity that is highly relevant to participants in an exercise promotion intervention. It matches how physical activity would be assessed in usual practice.

Score: [5]

Primary analysis:

Relevant quotes:

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Multiple imputation was used to include all participants in the analyses.&quot;</span>

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants were analysed in the groups to which they were randomised, regardless of whether they received the intervention or not, and multiple imputation was used to include all participants in the analyses.&quot;</span>

Explanation: An intention-to-treat approach was used with multiple imputation to account for missing data. This pragmatic analysis includes all randomized participants.

publication full text</span> (mean similarity 100%)</i></p>
<pre>
Here are the PRECIS-2 scores for the trial based on the full text publication:

Eligibility criteria:

Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;People with multiple sclerosis were screened on the General Health Questionnaire 12 and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, and those with low mood were recruited.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The eligibility criteria seem fairly pragmatic. Patients with MS were screened for low mood using common screening tools and those meeting the threshold were eligible. The criteria reflect how patients would likely be identified for this intervention in routine practice. However, some patients like those with visual impairment or unable to provide consent were excluded which reduces pragmatism slightly.

Score: [4] 

Recruitment:

Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Clusters of eight participants, who could attend groups on the same day, were randomly allocated, using a web-based randomization programme prepared in advance by the Clinical Trials Unit at Nottingham University, to an intervention or control group.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: Participants were recruited in clusters rather than individually which is less pragmatic. The use of a web-based randomization system is also more explanatory. However, recruitment was based on screening patients with MS which is reasonably pragmatic.

Score: [3]

Setting:

Quote: No direct quote on setting, but this was a community-based trial. 

Reasoning: The trial was conducted in the community rather than a specialized research setting, which matches routine care delivery. This suggests a pragmatic approach for the setting domain.

Score: [5] 

Organization: 

Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The groups were delivered by two Band 5 assistant psychologists, who were supervised by a Band 8a clinical psychologist, experienced in working with people with multiple sclerosis.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The intervention was delivered by assistant psychologists with supervision, reflecting staffing that could deliver this intervention in routine practice. No indication of extra training, resources or provider qualifications needed. Overall a pragmatic approach to organization.

Score: [4]

Flexibility - Delivery:

Quote: No relevant quotes on flexibility of delivery.

Reasoning: No details provided on protocol flexibility or restrictions on co-interventions. In the absence of information, I would score this domain as pragmatic, assuming flexibility similar to routine practice.

Score: [4]

Flexibility - Adherence:

Quote: No relevant quotes on flexibility of adherence.

Reasoning: No indication of measures to enforce adherence or monitor compliance. In the absence of information, I would score this domain as pragmatic.

Score: [4] 

Follow-up:

Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Four and eight months after random allocation, participants were sent a booklet of outcome questionnaires to complete and return by post.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: Follow-up was limited to 4 and 8 months with postal questionnaires. This seems reasonably pragmatic and similar to routine practice. No indication of more intense measurement or follow-up.

Score: [4]

Primary Outcome:

Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Quality of life was assessed using the EQ-5D.&quot;</span> 

Reasoning: The primary outcome of quality of life measured by EQ-5D is patient-centered and pragmatic.

Score: [5]

Primary Analysis:

Quote: No relevant quotes on analysis plan.

Reasoning: No details provided on the primary analysis. In the absence of information, I would score this domain as pragmatic, assuming an intention-to-treat approach.

Score: [4]</pre>

<pre>
Here are the PRECIS-2 scores for the trial based on the full text:

Eligibility criteria

Relevant quotes:
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The inclusion criteria were being definitely diagnosed with MS and having records in the Society and the exclusion criteria having history of other psychiatric disorders including major depressive disorder (according to the medical records and the physician's examinations) or bipolar disorder (except for cognitive disorders by which MS is characterized), substance dependency, any neurological disorders, history of taking corticosteroids or the disease recurrence within the previous six months.&quot;</span>

The eligibility criteria seem moderately pragmatic. Patients with a definite diagnosis of MS were included, which matches usual care. However, patients with major comorbid psychiatric disorders were excluded even though they may receive the intervention in usual care. Overall, the criteria are reasonably close to usual care but have some exclusions.

Score: [3] 

Recruitment

Relevant quotes: 
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Because the patients were not hospitalized and regularly referred to the Association, to follow randomized assignment, we decided to run the sampling within two consecutive months until we enrolled an adequate number of participants. Accordingly, 70 numbers, equal to the number of people required in each group, were developed and the numbers 1e70 were randomly assigned to two groups: experimental and control. After eligible patients referred to the Association, a number was randomly assigned to each patient according to his/her referring time and the patients were assigned to the two groups.&quot;</span>

Patients were recruited as they presented to the MS Association, which seems to match usual care. No extra effort beyond usual appointments was made.

Score: [5]

Setting

Relevant quotes:
The study was conducted at the Multiple Sclerosis Society of Isfahan, Iran. 

The setting matches where patients would normally receive care for MS.

Score: [5] 

Organization

Relevant quotes:
No additional staffing, resources or training were mentioned. The intervention appears to have been delivered within the existing organization.

Score: [5]

Flexibility: delivery

Relevant quotes:
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The intervention was implemented within two days a week. For the control group, a routine protocol was conducted. For blinding, the patients of the control group referred to the Society on certain days of week and those of the experimental on other days.&quot;</span>

The delivery seems reasonably flexible and close to usual care. No strict protocol was mentioned.

Score: [4]

Flexibility: adherence

Relevant quotes: 
No measures to enforce adherence were mentioned. Patients seem to have received the usual encouragement.

Score: [5] 

Follow-up

Relevant quotes:
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Moreover, to investigate the efficacy of the FHM, the DASS-21 and Piper Standard Scale were administered to the experimental group in the follow-up session.&quot;</span>

Follow-up was limited to a single assessment at 3 months, which seems pragmatic.

Score: [5]

Outcomes

Relevant quotes:
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;To investigate depression, anxiety, and stress, DASS-21, developed by Lovibond and Lovibond in 1995, was used and its validity and reliability were confirmed [17]. To measure fatigue, the Piper Standard Scale was used.&quot;</span> 

The outcomes of depression, anxiety, stress and fatigue are highly relevant for MS patients.

Score: [5]

Analysis

Relevant quotes:
No details provided on analysis plan.

Score: [NA]</pre>

Here are the PRECIS-2 scores and explanations for the trial described in "1567.pdf":

1. Eligibility criteria

Quotes: 
<span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 97.6%):

Persons with MS (N ¼ 183) with cognitive concerns were randomly assigned to either the 8week MAPSS-MS intervention or usual care plus freely available computer games.' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;Persons with MS (N 1⁄4 183) with cognitive concerns were randomly assigned to either the 8-week MAPSS-MS intervention or usual care plus freely available computer games.&quot;</span>

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The 347 persons who were initially screened as “eligible” were later contacted by phone to invite their participation during specific dates.&quot;</span> 

<span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 96.7%):

The Perceived Deficits Questionnaire 19 was administered by phone, and those scoring at least 10 (indicating some problems in at least 5 areas) were eligible to participate.' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;Using the Perceived Deficits Questionnaire, and those scoring at least 10 (indicating some problems in at least 5 areas) were eligible to participate.&quot;</span>

Explanation: The eligibility criteria are moderately pragmatic - participants had clinically definite MS for at least 6 months and had some cognitive concerns, which matches the intended recipients for the intervention. However, there were some additional exclusions like visual acuity requirements and exacerbation-free period.

Score: [3]

2. Recruitment

Quotes:
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants were recruited via physician referral, targeted mailings to persons with MS on the mailing list of the National MS Society, contact with support groups, and notices in MS newsletters and web sites.&quot;</span>

Explanation: Recruitment involved some extra efforts like targeted mailings and advertising beyond usual care appointments, making it moderately pragmatic.  

Score: [3]

3. Setting

Quotes: 
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants were recruited from three large metropolitan communities in Texas: Houston, San Antonio and Dallas.&quot;</span>

Explanation: The setting spanned multiple communities making it more pragmatic than a single specialized center, but there is no mention if they reflect the usual care settings.

Score: [3] 

4. Organization

Quotes:
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The facilitator prescribed exercises from a study-specific protocol addressing the most common deficits experienced by persons with MS (attention, memory, flexibility, and problem solving).&quot;</span>

Explanation: The intervention required some additional training for facilitators and a specific protocol, reducing organizational flexibility compared to usual care.

Score: [2] 

5. Flexibility: Delivery

Quotes:
<span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The sessions were all individual based on interaction with child and allowed for range of responses to the intervention&quot;</span>

Explanation: The delivery allows flexibility in how participants engage with the intervention.

Score: [4]

6. Flexibility: Adherence

Quotes:
<span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 97.6%):

participant was asked to complete 3 sessions (45e60 min of training) a day three times a week, (approximately 45 games) and to keep a written log of practice time.' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;Participants were asked to complete 3 sessions (45e60 min of training) a day three times a week, (approximately 45 games) and to keep a written log of practice time.&quot;</span> 

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The researchers monitored exercise practice and completion.&quot;</span>

Explanation: There was close monitoring of adherence and participants had to complete a minimum amount of training, reducing flexibility.

Score: [2]

7. Follow-up

Quotes: 
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Neuropsychological testing and questionnaire data were collected from all subjects at baseline, following completion of the intervention, and 3 and 6 months post-intervention.&quot;</span>

Explanation: Follow-up was more frequent than usual care to assess outcomes.

Score: [2]

8. Primary Outcome

Quotes:
<span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 99.6%):

The primary purpose of this study was to determine the effectiveness of a novel computerassisted cognitive rehabilitation intervention MAPSS-MS (Memory, Attention, Problem Solving Skills in MS) in a multi-site trial with persons with MS.' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;The primary purpose of this study was to determine the effectiveness of a novel computer-assisted cognitive rehabilitation intervention MAPSS-MS (Memory, Attention, Problem Solving Skills in MS) in a multi-site trial with persons with MS.&quot;</span>

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The primary outcome of overall neurocognitive competence in activities of daily living (verbal memory performance, use of cognitive strategies and performance on cognitive-related IADLs).&quot;</span>

Explanation: The primary outcome directly measures cognitive functioning which is relevant for patients.

Score: [4] 

9. Primary Analysis

Quotes:
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Data analyses were conducted using SPSS, version 24.0 for Windows (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Neuropsychological data were scored by the testers and verified by a second staff member. Data were entered and checked for accuracy.&quot;</span>

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Missing data are often problematic for randomized controlled trials and various strategies are used to manage missing data. For the current study, we employed intention-to-treat strategies to handle missing data using a “last observation carried forward” (LOCF) strategy in which missing data points are imputed based on the participant's existing data.&quot;</span>

Explanation: An intention-to-treat analysis was used including all participants as randomized.

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Inclusion criteria were (1) 18–60 years of age, (2) ⩽2 years since clinical diagnosis with relapsing remitting MS (RRMS) and (3) no relapses or changes in medication status 8 weeks prior to inclusion.&quot;</span>

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Eligibility was confirmed by project nurses based on patients’ medical records.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The inclusion criteria are fairly broad, allowing patients 18-60 years old with RRMS diagnosed within the past 2 years. The only exclusions are related to recent relapses and medication changes. Eligibility was confirmed through medical records, reflecting eligibility in real-world practice. Overall, this is a pragmatic approach to eligibility.

Score: [4]

Recruitment:

Relevant quotes:  

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Patients were recruited in collaboration with six Danish regional MS clinics and The Danish MS Society.&quot;</span>

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Patients gave informed written consent prior to inclusion.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: Patients were recruited through their regular MS clinics, which reflects real-world recruitment. While patients did have to provide consent to participate, this minimal extra effort is needed for any clinical trial. The recruitment approach overall seems fairly pragmatic.

Score: [4] 

Setting:

Relevant quotes:

<span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 99.6%):

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Patients (n = 84) were recruited in collaboration with six Danish regional MS clinics and The Danish MS Society.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: This was a multicenter trial recruiting patients from regional MS clinics across Denmark. Conducting the trial in the patients' regular care settings enhances the applicability and generalizability of the results. The setting aligns closely with real-world care.

Score: [5]

Organisation:

Relevant quotes:

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Supervised exercise sessions were performed twice weekly for the full study period of 48 weeks, and was planned on the basis of four principles (adapted from Stathopoulos and Felson Duchan)13: (1) individual tailoring, (2) application of exercise types matching the goal of the intervention, (3) progressive overload and (4) sufficient intensity to induce the desired effects of the intervention.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The exercise intervention was delivered by exercise professionals as part of the trial. There is no mention of additional resources, training, or expertise beyond what would be available in real-world practice. The organization of the intervention delivery seems pragmatic.

Score: [4]

Flexibility of experimental intervention (delivery):

Relevant quotes:

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The exercise intervention was planned as high-intense aerobic exercise, monitored relative to the patients’ individual maximal heart rate (HRmax), and progressed within and between 4 meso cycles of 12 weeks.&quot;</span>

<span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 99.2%):

The exercise sessions consisted of continuous sessions lasting 30–60 minutes with an intensity of 60%–80% HRmax and interval training sessions lasting 30–60 minutes with an interval duration of 1–10 minutes and intensities varying from 65%–95% HRma' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;The exercise sessions consisted of continuous sessions lasting 30–60 minutes with an intensity of 60%–80% HRmax and interval training sessions lasting 30–60 minutes with an interval duration of 1–10 minutes and intensities varying from 65%–95% HRmax.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The exercise intervention followed a fairly structured protocol with specified intensity, duration, and progression criteria. This reduces flexibility in delivery compared to real-world exercise. However, some tailoring and professional judgment was allowed. Overall, the delivery seems moderately flexible.

Score: [3] 

Flexibility of experimental intervention (adherence):

Relevant quotes: 

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Patients in the supervised exercise group completed 90.0 (8.6)% of the planned sessions at an average intensity of 84.4 (3.0)% HRmax.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: Adherence was measured but there is no mention of specific efforts to enforce or improve adherence beyond what would occur in usual care. Patients seemed free to engage with the intervention as in real life. This represents a pragmatic approach.

Score: [4]

Follow-up:

Relevant quotes:

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;All patients were scanned using the exact same 3-Tesla MRI scanner (MAGNETOM Skyra, Siemens Medical Systems, Erlangen, Germany) at the same location, for all patients, and at all timepoints.&quot;</span>

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The number of relapses in the study period was obtained from the medical records of the included patients in the RCT by project nurses (blinded to group allocation) and from The Danish MS Registry for the population-based control group.&quot;</span> 

Reasoning: Patients underwent MRI scans at baseline, 24 weeks, and 48 weeks. Relapse data was obtained from medical records. The follow-up intensity seems moderately higher than in usual care but is needed for the trial outcomes.

Score: [3] 

Primary outcome:

Relevant quotes:

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The relapse rate and the global brain atrophy rate were the primary outcomes of this study.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The relapse rate and brain atrophy are clinically meaningful outcomes to patients. This represents a pragmatic choice of primary outcomes.

Score: [5]

Here are the PRECIS-2 scores for the trial based on the full text:

Eligibility criteria

Relevant quotes:

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The inclusion criteria were: males and females; age 18 to 70; diagnosis of MS (primary or secondary progressive, relapsing-remitting), without relapses in the preceding three months and an Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score between 4 and 5.5.&quot;</span>

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The exclusion criteria were: other conditions that may affect motor function, impaired cognitive functioning that interferes with the acquisition of the consent to the study.&quot;</span>

The eligibility criteria are reasonably broad, including different types of MS patients between ages 18-70 with EDSS scores between 4-5.5, indicating moderate disability but unassisted walking ability. The main exclusions are for other conditions affecting motor function and cognitive impairment interfering with consent, which seem reasonable. Overall, the criteria appear to target a relevant MS population for the intervention without overly narrow restrictions.

Score: [4]

Recruitment

Relevant quote:

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Patients have been recruited at Ferrara University Hospital from patients who attend the Rehabilitation Outpatient Clinic for gait rehabilitation. They signed informed consent before any evaluation or treatment.&quot;</span>

The participants were recruited directly from the rehabilitation clinic where they were already receiving gait rehabilitation, suggesting a pragmatic approach recruiting the target population in a clinically relevant setting.

Score: [5] 

Setting

Relevant quote: 

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Patients have been recruited at Ferrara University Hospital from patients who attend the Rehabilitation Outpatient Clinic for gait rehabilitation.&quot;</span>

The trial was conducted at a single hospital rehabilitation clinic, which matches the setting where the intervention would be applied in practice. 

Score: [5]

Organisation

Relevant quotes:

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;During TOCT, they received feedback (visual and auditory) from the physiotherapist.&quot;</span>

Follow-up intensity was greater than usual care with monthly visits, but appears reasonable to support the home program. Data collection was not excessive.

Score: [4]  

Primary outcome

Relevant quote:

<span title='Moderate quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 91.8%):

6-minute walking test (6MWT) for walking enduranc' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ff9e81'>&quot;Six Minute Walk Test (6MWT) for walking endurance&quot;</span>

The 6MWT is a direct measure of walking ability that is clinically meaningful to patients.

Score: [5]

Primary analysis

Relevant quote:

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;An intention-to-treat analysis was carried out on all outcome measures, handling missing data (n = 2 at T1, n = 7 at T2) with the last observation carried forward approach.&quot;</span>

The analysis was intention-to-treat, including all randomized participants.

Score: [5]

In summary, this trial took a highly pragmatic approach across most domains, with reasonably broad eligibility criteria, clinically relevant recruitment and setting, delivery consistent with standard care, flexibility in adherence, outcome directly meaningful to patients, and intention-to-treat analysis. The slightly less pragmatic elements were the single center design, some protocol guidance on delivery, and closer than usual follow-up to support the home program. Overall, the design choices align well with the goal of evaluating the intervention's effectiveness under real-world conditions.</pre>

Here are the PRECIS-2 scores for the trial described in the attached paper "1769.pdf":

Eligibility criteria:
Score: [2]  

Relevant quotes: 
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Patients with multiple sclerosis were randomly selected into treated and control groups; only patients who could walk with or without walking aids were admitted to the trial, and these cases were initially assessed and scored during an inactive phase of the disease.&quot;</span>

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Patients with diabetes mellitus or hypertension or who gave a history of psychiatric illness or peptic ulcer were not admitted to the treated group.&quot;</span> 

The eligibility criteria exclude patients with certain comorbidities and only include patients who can walk, indicating a rather explanatory approach. The eligibility seems more restrictive than would occur in usual care.

Here are the PRECIS-2 scores and explanations for the trial described in "1770.pdf":

Eligibility criteria

Quotes: 
1) "Only patients with a clinical or laboraton- sup
ported definite diagnosis of MS according to the
Poser criteria (6), suffering from a relapse, were
included."
2) "Patients with contraindications to bed rest or
ACTH-treatment, such as hypersensitivity to
ACTH, acute infections, cardial insufficiency, psy-
chosis, pregnancy, Cushing syndrome or peptic
ulcer, were excluded."

Explanation: The eligibility criteria are rather explanatory. Patients must have a definitive diagnosis of MS based on strict criteria, and several exclusions are made based on contraindications to the treatment. Pregnant women are excluded, even though they may receive this treatment in usual care. Overall, the criteria limit the participants to a narrower population than would typically receive this intervention in usual care.

Score: [2]

Recruitment

Quotes: No relevant quotes. The paper does not describe the recruitment process.

Explanation: There is insufficient information provided in the paper to assess the recruitment domain. 

Score: [NA] 

Setting

Quotes:
1) "Three neurological departments in the Netherlands
(University Hospital Groningen, Streekziekenhuis
Almelo, Diaconessenhuis Meppel) participated 
in
this study."

Explanation: The trial took place across 3 hospitals in the Netherlands. Running the trial across multiple centers makes the setting more pragmatic. However, it is unclear if these hospitals represent the typical settings where this treatment would be delivered in usual care.

Score: [3]

Organization

Quotes: No relevant quotes. The paper does not describe the organization of care delivery.

Explanation: There is insufficient information provided in the paper to assess the organization domain.

Score: [NA]

Flexibility: Delivery

Quotes: 
1) "Treatment with either bed rest during 
3 weeks and
a synthetic ACTH depotpreparation (1 mg,
100 units, tapered over 12 weeks), and Vitamin
B-complex or bed rest and Vitamin B-complex intra-
muscular injections in the same scheme 
(5)."

Explanation: The intervention is standardized with a defined drug, dose, and tapering schedule. This protocol-driven approach reduces flexibility in delivery. However, some flexibility may exist in the application of bed rest.

Score: [2] 

Flexibility: Adherence

Quotes: No relevant quotes. The paper does not describe measures to ensure adherence.

Explanation: There is insufficient information provided in the paper to assess the flexibility of adherence domain.

Score: [NA]

Follow-up

Quotes:
1) "Follow-up was performed in the 6th and 12th
week of treatment and 6, 
9, and 12 months after the
start of treatment."

Explanation: Follow-up is more frequent than would occur in usual care, with visits at 6 weeks, 12 weeks, 6 months, 9 months, and 12 months. This intensive follow-up schedule makes it more explanatory.

Score: [2]

Primary Outcome

Quotes:
1) "A faster recovery was seen in the ACTH-group, but
the ultimate extent of improvement was not greater
than that attained by placebo."

Explanation: The primary outcome of recovery and improvement in symptoms is clinically meaningful and patient-centered. This is a pragmatic choice.

Score: [4]

Primary Analysis

Quotes: No relevant quotes. The paper does not describe the primary analysis.

Explanation: There is insufficient information provided in the paper to assess the primary analysis domain.

<pre>
Here are the PRECIS-2 scores and explanations for the trial described in "1771.pdf":

1. Eligibility criteria

Quotes:
-<span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 97.3%):

For inclusion and exclusion criteria, see LangeskovChristensen et al. 2' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;For inclusion and exclusion criteria, see Langeskov-Christensen et al. 24&quot;</span> 
-<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Following inclusion and baseline testing, participants were randomized (1:1) to a PAE or waitlist group using block randomization, stratified by sex.&quot;</span>

The eligibility criteria are not explicitly stated in the full text. However, based on the quotes above, it seems that typical MS patients were included without extensive exclusion criteria, and they were randomized equally to the intervention or control group. This suggests a pragmatic approach.

Score: [4] 

2. Recruitment

Quote: 
-<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Eighty-six participants were recruited from Danish MS clinics (Aarhus University Hospital, Viborg Regional Hospital, Odense University Hospital, and the MS Clinic of Southern Jutland (Kolding)).&quot;</span>

Patients were recruited from typical MS clinics, suggesting a pragmatic approach. No extra efforts beyond routine clinic visits seem to have been made. 

Score: [4]

3. Setting

Quote:
-<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Eighty-six participants were recruited from Danish MS clinics (Aarhus University Hospital, Viborg Regional Hospital, Odense University Hospital, and the MS Clinic of Southern Jutland (Kolding)).&quot;</span>

Patients were recruited from multiple typical MS clinics, suggesting a pragmatic setting.

Score: [4] 

4. Organization

Quote: 
-<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Supervised PAE sessions were conducted twice weekly during the 24 weeks, with one continuous and one interval exercise session performed each week.&quot;</span>

The intervention was delivered with additional supervision and monitoring compared to usual care. This suggests a more explanatory approach.

Score: [2]

5. Flexibility (delivery)

Quote:
-<span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 99.4%):

In brief, the session volume increased from 30 to 60 minutes during the intervention while the intensity M Langeskov-Christensen, LG Hvid et al. journals.sagepub.com/home/msj 3 increased from 65% to 95% of individual maximum heart rate (HR max' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;In brief, the session volume increased from 30 to 60 minutes during the intervention while the intensity increased from 65% to 95% of individual maximum heart rate (HRmax).&quot;</span>

The exercise intervention followed a strict protocol with increasing intensity, suggesting limited flexibility in delivery.

Score: [2]

6. Flexibility (adherence)

No relevant quotes. The paper does not mention any strategies to enforce or monitor adherence.

Score: [NA] 

7. Follow-up

Quote:
-<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;At baseline (T0), after 24 (T24) and after 48 (T48) weeks, participants performed the BRB-N, the Major Depression Inventory (MDI), and a cardiorespiratory fitness test (VO2-max test). Each test session was separated by at least 48 hours from the last exercise bout.&quot;</span>

Follow-up assessments were done at fixed timepoints with no additional unscheduled visits. This seems consistent with a pragmatic approach.

Score: [4]

8. Primary outcome 

Quote:
-<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Assessments included the Brief Repeatable Battery of Neuropsychological tests (BRB-N), self-reported mood, and cardiorespiratory fitness.&quot;</span>

The BRB-N includes outcomes directly relevant to patients' cognitive functioning. This is a pragmatic choice of primary outcome.

Score: [5]

9. Primary analysis

No quotes. The paper does not provide details on the primary analysis.

The eligibility criteria are fairly broad, including patients aged 18-65 years with relapsing forms of MS per standard diagnostic criteria, with mild to moderate disability per EDSS score requirements. Exclusions were mainly for safety reasons and prior treatment with other DMTs. Overall, this seems reasonably similar to patients who would receive fingolimod in real-world practice. Score: [4] 

Recruitment
Relevant quotes: 
No details provided on recruitment methods.

In the event that more than one item was missing from a subscale score of the TSQM, the subscale was considered invalid.&quot;</span>

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;For any of the eight domains, if more than half of the questions were not answered, the score for that domain was stated as ‘missing’; furthermore, the MCS and PCS were also stated as ‘missing’ if any of the eight scale scores were absent.&quot;</span> 

Follow-up was at 6 months to assess outcomes. Missing data were accounted for. No further details on follow-up frequency/intensity. Score: [3]

Here are the PRECIS-2 domain scores and explanations for the trial described in "1773.pdf":

Eligibility criteria

Relevant quotes:

<span title='Major quote deviation, possible hallucination. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 65.3%):

ing to Mc-Donald criteria (McDonald, 2001); ability to walk (with or without aid) at least 20 m without rest; absence of other diseases that might have affected muscle function.' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: red'>&quot;The patient inclusion criteria included a confirmed disease diagnosis by a neurologist, according to Mc-Donald criteria (McDonald, 2001); ability to walk (with or without aid) at least 20 m without rest; absence of other diseases that might have affected muscle function.&quot;</span>

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants were randomly assigned to two different groups, the exercise group (EG) or the control group (CG). The EG, which included 16 women and 14 men (49.6 ± 11.0 yr), performed 12 weeks of resistance training followed by a detraining period where resistance exercise or other structured physical activity was avoided. The CG, which did not follow any resistance training during the study period, included 7 women and 5 men (46.2 ± 7.5 yr).&quot;</span> 

Reasoning: The eligibility criteria seem reasonably inclusive - patients only need to have a confirmed MS diagnosis, be able to walk 20 meters, and not have other conditions affecting muscle function. The criteria do not seem overly selective or include tests not used in usual care. However, the exclusion of patients unable to walk 20 meters may limit the generalizability of the results.

Score: [3]

Recruitment:

Relevant quotes: 

<span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 99.1%):

All participants were recruited among six MS rehabilitation centers within the region of Castilla y Le´on (Spain).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;All participants were recruited among six MS rehabilitation centers within the region of Castilla y León (Spain).&quot;</span>

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;After a group meeting where the details of the investigation were described to the patients, including possible risks and discomfort associated to the intervention, a formal invitation to take part in the study was offered.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: Participants were recruited from multiple MS rehabilitation centers, which seems reasonably similar to how patients might be recruited in usual practice. However, the formal group meeting and invitation process may involve slightly more effort than typical recruitment.

Score: [3] 

Setting:

Relevant quotes:

<span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 99.1%):

All participants were recruited among six MS rehabilitation centers within the region of Castilla y Le´on (Spain).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;All participants were recruited among six MS rehabilitation centers within the region of Castilla y León (Spain).&quot;</span> 

Reasoning: The setting of multiple rehabilitation centers seems pragmatic and similar to real-world settings where MS patients receive care. Conducting the trial across multiple centers increases generalizability.

Score: [4]

Organization:

Relevant quotes:

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;All training sessions took place in MS rehabilitation centers and the patients were continuously supervised by physical therapists.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The training sessions took place in existing rehabilitation centers with supervision from physical therapists, suggesting the organization was similar to usual care. No additional resources or training were described.

Score: [4]

Flexibility - delivery: 

Relevant quotes:

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;After a standardized cycling warm-up, and one set of 5 repetitions (reps) with a light load, participants performed 3 sets of 8–12 reps with a load that was progressively increased from 35 to 70% of MVIC through the training period (Table 2). Recovery time between sets was 3 minutes. Subjects were requested to push with maximal effort during the concentric phase of the movement (90–180°) and to lower the load (eccentric action; 180–90°) in a controlled manner.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The resistance training protocol is reasonably specific in terms of sets, repetitions, load progression, and concentric/eccentric tempo. This reduces flexibility in delivery compared to usual rehabilitation programs.

Score: [2]

Flexibility - adherence:

Relevant quotes:

No relevant quotes found.

Reasoning: The paper does not mention any strategies to monitor or improve adherence. Patients seem to have been free to engage with the training as in usual rehabilitation.

Score: [4] 

Follow-up:

Relevant quotes:

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Testing was performed on three different occasions: before (week 0) and after (week 12) the training program, and after the detraining period (week 24).&quot;</span>

Reasoning: Follow-up measurements were performed at baseline, after the training program, and after detraining. This schedule does not seem more extensive than would occur in usual practice.

Score: [4]

Primary outcome: 

Relevant quotes:  

<span title='Moderate quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 75.8%):

Dependent variables included maximal voluntary isometric contraction (MVIC), maximal torque, aver' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ff9e81'>&quot;Dependent variables included maximal voluntary isometric contraction (MVIC), maximal torque, average power and muscle endurance.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The primary outcomes of muscle strength, power, and endurance are highly relevant for MS patients and clinicians. These outcomes can be readily assessed in usual practice.

Score: [5]

Primary analysis:

Relevant quotes:

No relevant quotes found.

Reasoning: The paper does not provide details on the primary analysis. In the absence of information, I will not provide a score.

Bell’s palsy is usually diagnosed by a general practitioner in primary care.'\n\nThe eligibility criteria exclude patients with several medical conditions that would make them ineligible to receive prednisolone or acyclovir treatment in usual care. However, the requirement for diagnosis confirmation by a specialist otorhinolaryngologist is more restrictive than in usual care where Bell's palsy is typically diagnosed by a general practitioner. This extra test would exclude some patients who would otherwise receive the treatment in routine practice.\n\nScore: [2] \n\n2. Recruitment\n\nRelevant quotes: \n\nNo relevant quotes.

It is, however, an easy clinical test widely used in secondary care for grading recovery from facial nerve paralysis caused by damage to lower motor neurons.' \n\n'Central adjudication—Photographs taken of patients were assessed and graded independently by a panel of three experts (not general practitioners, who usually assess).'\n\nThe House-Brackmann scale is not routinely used in primary care to assess Bell's palsy. Evaluation by experts rather than the patients' usual physicians makes the outcome assessment less representative of real-world practice.\n\nScore: [1]\n\n9. Primary analysis\n\nRelevant quotes:\n\nNo relevant quotes on the primary analysis method.\n\nScore: [NA]\n"," Here are the PRECIS-2 scores and explanations for the trial described in '663.pdf':\n\nEligibility criteria\n\nQuotes:\n- 'Patients ≥ 3 with acute respiratory tract infections. Exclusions not common cold but severe respiratory tract infections, peptic ulcer and asthma. But even asthma patients who were not sensitive to ibuprofen or aspirin eligible. Pregnant or breast feeding women are discouraged from taking ibuprofen when pregnant but can take as low a dose as possible of Paracetemol but as both being tested in the trial cannot include this group as participants. If include visually impaired increase organisation of trial (as in carers have to assist diary completion) but that would be norm and usual if prescribed ibuprofen or Paracetemol or steam treatment in usual care, so just easier for trialists to exclude. Small proportion of participants – so why exclude? Depressed and people with psychosis unreliable diary fillers, concerned with other things.'\n\nReasoning: The eligibility criteria are fairly broad, including patients with acute respiratory infections visiting primary care which is a typical patient population. Some exclusions like pregnant women are for safety reasons. Overall fairly pragmatic.\n\nScore: [4]\n\nRecruitment\n\nQuotes:  \n- 'Patients presenting to GP or nurse in primary care with respiratory tract infections as diagnosed by health professional. Easy to recruit to but time pressures in busy winter clinics prevented recruitment and meant non-recruitments logs poorly completed.'\n\nReasoning: Patients were recruited during regular primary care visits, a very pragmatic approach. Some issues with recruitment due to time pressures indicates it was not ideal.\n\nScore: [4] \n\nSetting\n\nQuotes:\n- 'Identical setting to usual care setting - primary care, where patients usually go for advice and treatment of the common cold in the UK.'\n- 'Multi-centre: 25 practices in UK.'\n\nReasoning: The setting of primary care clinics is identical to the usual care setting. Being multi-center also increases pragmatism.\n\nScore: [5]\n\nOrganization\n\nQuotes:  \n- 'Information sheets given out to participants. This is not usual practice, would it be if trial had shown this helped? Need more staff for follow up of trial participants to get diary results so more extensive data collection than usual. Otherwise no difference in provider expertise and organisation of care delivery.'\n\nReasoning: Organization is fairly similar to usual care except for some additional information sheets and staff for follow-up. Still fairly pragmatic but some deviations.\n\nScore: [4]\n\nFlexibility (delivery)\n\nQuotes:\n- 'Full flexibility'\n\nReasoning: No protocol specified for delivery of interventions, left up to providers as in usual care.\n\nScore: [5] \n\nFlexibility (adherence)\n\nQuotes:\n- 'Compliance measured with diary – “reasonably good” participants free to “not-comply” with advice.

Patients come back to GP if problems.' \n- 'Trial more extensive data colleaction - patients telephoned day two to three to check for any problems with diary completion. If no diary after 2 weeks then mailed reminder and then phoned as necessary to document outcomes using validated questionnaire.'\n\nReasoning: Follow-up was more extensive than usual care with phone calls and reminders to collect diary data. But overall fairly pragmatic.\n\nScore: [4] \n\nPrimary outcome\n\nQuotes:  \n- 'Very relevant to participants - Mean symptom severity on days 2-4. Symptoms 0 (no problem) to 6 (as bad as they can be 7 in abstract).

<h4>User prompt</h4>
<pre>
You are an expert in clinical trial design and are tasked to assess the PRECIS-2 scores of a trial based on the full text of its publication. You have the briefing in the attached "Loudon 2015.pdf" and "PRECIS Toolkit.pdf"

The full text to be assessed is attached as "ID.pdf".

For each of the 9 domains of PRECIS-2, perform the following steps:

1. Extract 1-3 relevant quotes from the full text.

2. Explain your reasoning in 1 paragraph.

3. Give a score X from 1 (very explanatory) to 5 (very pragmatic) in square brackets like this: "Score: [X]". If the full text does not contain enough information to assess a specific domain, report "Score: [NA]".

Do not provide a final summary paragraph in the end.
