- Quote: ""Participants were included who scored >2 on the General Health Questionnaire 12, a measure of psychological distress, or >7 on the anxiety and depression subscales of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, thus confirming they had low mood.""
- Reasoning: The eligibility criteria for this trial are quite specific, requiring participants to have a certain score on two different psychological distress scales. This suggests that the trial is not including all individuals with multiple sclerosis, but rather a subset of these individuals who also have low mood. This makes the trial less generalizable to the broader population of individuals with multiple sclerosis.
- Score: [2]

2. Recruitment
- Quote: ""Participants were recruited for a randomized trial of adjustment groups for people with multiple sclerosis and low mood between June 2008 and September 2009.""
- Reasoning: The text does not provide specific details about how participants were recruited, such as whether they were recruited from a specific clinic or through broader advertising efforts. Without this information, it is difficult to assess how pragmatic the recruitment process was.
- Score: [NA]

3. Setting
- Quote: ""The groups were delivered by two Band 5 assistant psychologists, who were supervised by a Band 8a clinical psychologist, experienced in working with people with multiple sclerosis.""
- Reasoning: The trial was conducted in a setting that involved psychologists experienced in working with people with multiple sclerosis. This suggests that the trial setting may not be representative of usual care settings, where such specialized expertise may not be available.
- Score: [2]

4. Organisation
- Quote: ""The groups involved teaching people to recognise symptoms of distress and introduced them to strategies to improve their mood.""
- Reasoning: The intervention was delivered in a structured group setting, which may not reflect the usual care setting for individuals with multiple sclerosis. Additionally, the intervention required the involvement of specialized healthcare professionals (psychologists), which may not be available in all usual care settings.
- Score: [2]

5. Flexibility (delivery)
- Quote: ""Participants allocated to intervention were invited to attend a psychological adjustment group for six sessions over 12 weeks.""
- Reasoning: The intervention was delivered in a structured format with a set number of sessions over a specific time period. This suggests a lack of flexibility in the delivery of the intervention, as it does not allow for individual variations in treatment needs or preferences.
- Score: [2]

6. Flexibility (adherence)
- Quote: ""Participants allocated to the control group received all other rehabilitation routinely provided and were offered the opportunity to attend groups once they had completed the study.""
- Reasoning: The text does not provide specific information about measures taken to ensure participants' adherence to the intervention. However, the fact that control group participants were offered the opportunity to attend the intervention groups after the study suggests some flexibility in adherence to the study protocol.
- Score: [NA]

7. Follow-up
- Quote: ""Four and eight months after random allocation, participants were sent a booklet of outcome questionnaires to complete and return by post.""
- Reasoning: The follow-up process involved sending participants questionnaires by post, which may not reflect the usual care follow-up process. This suggests a more explanatory approach to follow-up.
- Score: [2]

8. Primary outcome
- Quote: ""Effectiveness was initially defined as the change in EQ-5D scores and a cost-effectiveness analysis was performed using this outcome measure.""
- Reasoning: The primary outcome of the trial was the change in EQ-5D scores, a measure of health-related quality of life. This is a patient-relevant outcome that is likely to be of interest in usual care settings, suggesting a more pragmatic approach to the choice of primary outcome.
- Score: [4]

9. Primary analysis
- Quote: ""The incremental costs effectiveness ratio was calculated by dividing the mean reduction in costs between intervention and control (−£401) by the mean reduction in BDI score (−3.41).""

- ""Patients in the supervised exercise group completed 90.0 (8.6)% of the planned sessions at an average intensity of 84.4 (3.0)% HRmax (for comparison, the planned average intensity was 76.2% HRmax).""

Reasoning: The trial required a high level of adherence from participants, with specific expectations for session completion and exercise intensity. This suggests a more explanatory approach, as it may not reflect the variability in adherence that would be expected in usual care.

Score: [2]

7. Follow-up

Quotes:
- ""The study period covers 48 weeks with outcome assessment at baseline (T0), after 24 weeks (T24), and after 48 weeks (T48).""

Reasoning: The follow-up schedule in this trial is quite structured, with specific time points for outcome assessment. This may not reflect the variability in follow-up schedules that would be expected in usual care, suggesting a more explanatory approach.

Score: [2]

8. Primary outcome

Quotes:
- ""The aim of the present study was therefore to investigate the efficacy of supervised exercise therapy in newly diagnosed patients (⩽2 years since diagnosis) on primarily relapse rate and global brain atrophy and secondarily on regional brain atrophy, lesion load and diffusion-kurtosis MRI-measures of microstructural integrity.""

Reasoning: The primary outcomes of this trial, relapse rate and global brain atrophy, are clinically relevant and likely to be important to patients. This suggests a more pragmatic approach.

Score: [4]

9. Primary analysis

7. Follow-up

Quotes:
- ""After the randomization visit, follow-up appointments were arranged for both groups at 3, 9 and 12 months.""
- ""At each follow-up visit, the general health status of the patient was assessed, medical treatment was revised and optimized, educational reinforcement was provided, 6-minute walk test (6MWT) and spirometry tests were carried out and HRQoL measures were taken.""

Reasoning: The trial includes follow-up appointments at 3, 9, and 12 months, during which various assessments are carried out. This suggests a somewhat explanatory approach as it involves more intensive follow-up than might occur in usual care. However, the follow-up appointments also include elements of usual care, such as revising and optimizing medical treatment.

2. Recruitment

- Quote: ""A total of 120 PwMS were recruited via the Sheffield MS Clinic and flyers/community adverts displayed at the local South Yorkshire MS Society branches.""
- Reasoning: The recruitment methods used in this trial, including recruitment from a specific clinic and through community advertisements, suggest a somewhat pragmatic approach. However, the use of a single clinic for recruitment may limit the generalizability of the results to other settings.
- Score: [4]

3. Setting

- Quote: ""During weeks 1–6, participants attended two supervised sessions per week at a university exercise research facility and engaged in one additional self-directed exercise session in their home environment.""
- Reasoning: The trial was conducted in a university exercise research facility and in participants' home environments. This suggests a somewhat pragmatic approach, as it includes a setting (home) that is likely to be similar to where the intervention would be applied in usual care. However, the use of a university research facility may not be representative of all usual care settings.
- Score: [3]

4. Organisation

- Quote: ""An exercise physiologist supervised the delivery of the intervention but with physiotherapist input during the early stages of the programme.""
- Reasoning: The intervention was delivered by an exercise physiologist with input from a physiotherapist, which may not be representative of the resources and expertise available in all usual care settings. However, the text does not specify any additional resources or training required beyond what might be available in some usual care settings.
- Score: [3]

5. Flexibility (delivery)

- Quote: ""The prescribed strength training was based on individual functional needs, as assessed by the trial physiotherapist (NS). Strength training was undertaken by 48 of 60 participants in the intervention group and typically involved two to six different resistance exercises (e.g. wall press-ups, arm-curls, leg abduction, wall squats and/or regular squats, knee extensions, calf raises, sit-to-stand) each session.""
- Reasoning: The intervention was somewhat flexible in terms of delivery, with strength training exercises tailored to individual functional needs. However, the intervention was still somewhat prescriptive, with specific exercises recommended and supervised sessions provided.
- Score: [3]

6. Flexibility (adherence)

- Quote: ""Adherence to the supervised and home-exercise sessions was very good, with participants attending an average of 16.2 of the 18 supervised sessions (90%; range 7–18 sessions) and participating in an average of 14.6 of the 18 prescribed home-exercise sessions (81%, range 2–18 sessions).""
- Reasoning: The trial did not appear to have strict measures in place to ensure adherence to the intervention, and adherence was generally high. This suggests a somewhat pragmatic approach to adherence.
- Score: [4]

7. Follow-up

- Quote: ""Outcomes were assessed at baseline, and at three months (post-intervention) and nine months after randomisation.""
- Reasoning: The follow-up schedule in this trial, with assessments at three and nine months after randomisation, does not seem to be more intense than what might be expected in usual care. However, the text does not provide enough information to fully assess this domain.
- Score: [NA]

8. Primary outcome

- Quote: ""The primary outcome was self-reported exercise behaviour at three months using the Godin Leisure Time Exercise Questionnaire (GLTEQ).""
- Reasoning: The primary outcome of self-reported exercise behavior is likely to be relevant to participants and is measured in a way that is similar to how it might be assessed in usual care. This suggests a pragmatic approach to the primary outcome.
- Score: [5]

9. Primary analysis

- Quote: ""All analyses were by intention to treat, whereby participants were analysed in the arm to which they were randomised irrespective of whether they complied with the intervention.""
- Reasoning: The use of intention-to-treat analysis, which includes all participants regardless of their adherence to the intervention, suggests a pragmatic approach to the primary analysis.

Quotes:
- ""Adults with MS were included based on the ability to walk 5 km without rest or use of assistive device.""
- ""Exclusion criteria were reports to have run 5 km in the preceding 6 months or a relapse occurring in the preceding 3 months.""

Reasoning: The eligibility criteria for this trial are quite specific, excluding those who have run 5 km in the past 6 months or have had a relapse in the past 3 months. This suggests that the trial is targeting a specific subset of MS patients who are capable of walking 5 km without rest or assistive devices but are not currently engaged in regular running exercise. This may limit the generalizability of the trial results to the broader MS population.

Score: [2]

2. Recruitment

Quotes:
- ""Adults with multiple sclerosis were recruited through announcements at REVAL rehabilitation research institute (UHasselt), Flemish MS rehabilitation centers and MS Society, and Move-to-Sport.""

Reasoning: The recruitment process involved reaching out to potential participants through various channels, including rehabilitation institutes, MS rehabilitation centers, and the MS Society. This suggests a somewhat pragmatic approach, as these are places where people with MS are likely to be found in usual care. However, the use of these specific channels may also limit the generalizability of the trial results to those who are connected with these organizations.

Score: [3]

3. Setting

Quotes:
- ""Evaluation was performed at REVAL by a study nurse, a PhD student in Rehabilitation Sciences and Physiotherapy, and the project dedicated researcher (MSc in exercise physiology, PhD).""
- ""Neural imaging was recorded at UZA (University Hospital Antwerp, in Wilrijk) on another day mostly within 1-week time period.""

Reasoning: The trial was conducted in a research institute and a university hospital, which are not typical settings for usual care. This suggests a more explanatory approach, as the results may not be directly applicable to other settings where MS patients typically receive care.

Score: [2]

4. Organisation

Quotes:
- ""Participants received training instructions by email. They were asked to train three times weekly according to a personalized training intensity schedule that was based on their baseline aerobic capacity.""
- ""pwMS wore an activity tracker (Withings Pulse Ox) at the waist that registered the intensity of steps per minute.""

Reasoning: The trial required additional resources and expertise beyond what would typically be available in usual care, including personalized training instructions, email communication, and activity trackers. This suggests a more explanatory approach, as these resources may not be readily available in all usual care settings.

5. Flexibility (delivery)

Quotes:
- ""During the first weeks, training consisted of longer walking bouts, interspersed with short 1′ running bouts. The relative amount of running gradually increased until participants were able to run 5 km without interruption at 12 weeks.""
- ""Participants were asked to weekly upload data to allow remote supervision of the training adherence by the research assistant.""

Reasoning: The intervention was delivered in a highly structured manner, with specific instructions for how to gradually increase running bouts over the 12-week period. Participants were also required to upload data for remote supervision, which may not be feasible in usual care. This suggests a more explanatory approach.

6. Flexibility (adherence)

Quotes:
- ""The EXP group completed 607 of 648 prescribed sessions (94%).""
- ""If a participant had been inactive, a phone call was made for enquiry.""

Reasoning: The trial required high adherence to the intervention, with participants expected to complete three training sessions per week. If a participant was inactive, they were contacted by phone. This level of monitoring and enforcement of adherence is not typical in usual care, suggesting a more explanatory approach.

7. Follow-up

Quotes:
- ""Patients were tested at two time points (0 and 12 weeks).""
- ""The WLC group was offered a comparable training program after the final measurements.""

Reasoning: The follow-up period in this trial was relatively short, with only two time points for testing. This is not typical of usual care, where follow-up may be more frequent and over a longer period. However, the control group was offered the intervention after the trial, which is a pragmatic approach.

- Quote: ""Participants were randomised in groups of eight to physiotherapist (PT)-led exercise (n = 80), yoga (n = 77), fitness instructor (FI)-led exercise (n = 86) and they took part in weekly community-based group exercise sessions. Those in the control group were asked not to change of their exercise habits (n = 71). The primary outcome was the Multiple Sclerosis Impact Scale (MSIS) 29v2 physical component, measured before and after the 10-week intervention.""
- Reasoning: The follow-up in this trial involved measuring the primary outcome before and after the 10-week intervention, which is a relatively standard approach in clinical trials. This suggests a more explanatory approach, as it involves a level of monitoring and data collection that may not be typical in a real-world setting.
- Score: [2]

8. Primary outcome
- Quote: ""The primary outcome measure was the physical component of the Multiple Sclerosis Impact Scale-29, version 2 (MSIS-29v2), a patient-reported outcome measure that assesses the physical impact of MS.""
- Reasoning: The primary outcome of this trial is patient-reported and directly relevant to the participants' experience of their condition, suggesting a more pragmatic approach.
- Score: [5]

9. Primary analysis
- Quote: ""All participants were analysed in the groups to which they were randomised.""
- Reasoning: The trial used an intention-to-treat analysis, which is a more pragmatic approach as it includes all participants in the analysis regardless of their adherence to the intervention.
- Score: [5]","1. Eligibility criteria
- Quote: ""Eligible participants were over 18 years of age and had a diagnosis of MS that was confirmed by a consultant physician or neurologist. Persons with MS were excluded if they had a previous relapse or began steroid therapy in the 12 weeks prior to participating in the first assessment, were pregnant, or had a comorbidity that severely impacted their ability to safely participate in exercise.""
- Reasoning: The eligibility criteria for this trial are quite specific and exclude a number of potential participants, such as those who have had a recent relapse, are pregnant, or have a comorbidity that impacts their ability to exercise safely. This suggests a more explanatory approach, as the trial is not including all individuals who might receive the intervention in a real-world setting.
- Score: [2]

2. Recruitment
- Quote: ""Our study participants were referred to the project by themselves, their care-giver, MSI, chartered physiotherapists, neurologists, general practitioners or clinical nurse specialists.""
- Reasoning: The recruitment process for this trial involved a variety of sources, including self-referral, referral by caregivers, and referral by various healthcare professionals. This suggests a more pragmatic approach, as it mirrors the variety of ways in which individuals might come to participate in such an intervention in a real-world setting.
- Score: [4]

3. Setting
- Quote: ""This trial took place from April 2008 to October 2009, in 10 regions across the Republic of Ireland.""
- Reasoning: The trial was conducted in multiple regions across Ireland, suggesting a more pragmatic approach as it reflects the diversity of settings in which the intervention might be implemented in the real world.
- Score: [5]

4. Organisation
- Quote: ""All interventions took place in groups of eight, for an hour per week, for 10 weeks. They were delivered in community centres such as local gyms, hotels and health centres.""
- Reasoning: The organisation of the trial intervention appears to be quite pragmatic, as it was delivered in community settings and did not require any additional resources beyond what would typically be available in these settings.
- Score: [5]

5. Flexibility (delivery)
- Quote: ""The PT-led exercise provided was pre-defined. It consisted of a circuit-style class of exercises that were either resisted by body weight or by the addition of free weights.""
- Quote: ""The FI-led classes were not pre-defined, as the aim was to establish whether these classes were effective when encountered by those with MS in the community.""
- Reasoning: The trial shows a mix of flexibility in delivery. The PT-led exercise was pre-defined with a specific set of exercises, suggesting a more explanatory approach. However, the FI-led classes were not pre-defined, which is more pragmatic as it allows for variability in how the intervention is delivered.
- Score: [3]

6. Flexibility (adherence)
- Quote: ""Treatment fidelity was optimised by the instructors and participants documenting programme adherence.""
- Reasoning: The trial required participants to document their adherence to the programme, suggesting a more explanatory approach as this level of monitoring and documentation may not be typical in a real-world setting.

Reasoning: The follow-up period seems to be more explanatory as it involves specific time points for measurements, which may not reflect the variability in follow-up periods in a usual care setting.

Score: [2]

8. Primary outcome

Quotes:
- ""The main research question in this validation trial was: is the use of the H-CAD system for one month at least as good as usual care for the arm/hand function in stroke, TBI and MS patients?""

Reasoning: The primary outcome of the trial is relevant to participants as it focuses on the improvement of arm/hand function, which is a key concern for patients with stroke, TBI, and MS.

Score: [5]

9. Primary analysis

Quotes:
- ""The hypothesis is that the H-CAD system is at least as effective as the usual care for arm/hand function, measured with outcome measures for arm/hand function, given to the stroke, TBI and MS patients when they are living at home.""

Reasoning: The primary analysis of the trial is quite pragmatic as it involves an intention-to-treat analysis using all available data, which reflects the variability in patient adherence and response to the intervention in a usual care setting.

Quotes:
- ""Outcome measures were carried out within the local hospital’s rehabilitation unit. They were taken at baseline, after 8 and 12 weeks of the intervention period (i.e. either the exercise class or usual care).""
- ""At week 8 three participants discontinued participation, with missing data for one other. At week 12 one other participant discontinued participation, with missing data for three other participants.""

Reasoning: The trial involved follow-up assessments at specific time points (8 and 12 weeks), and there were instances of missing data due to participants discontinuing participation. This suggests a more explanatory approach, as it involves a level of follow-up that may not be typical in usual care.

This suggests that the trial is not including all potential candidates for the intervention, but rather a subset of individuals who meet these criteria. Therefore, the trial is more explanatory in nature.

2. Recruitment

Quotes:
- ""Of the 873 patients on the clinical register for multiple sclerosis 159 patients were deemed suitable for the study. These people were sent invitation letters and participant information sheets.""
- ""Thus 32 people with multiple sclerosis, 23 female and nine male, participated in the study.""

Reasoning: The recruitment process involved identifying suitable patients from a clinical register and sending them invitation letters and information sheets. This suggests a more explanatory approach, as it involves an active recruitment process rather than simply including all individuals who present at a clinic with the condition of interest.

Score: [2]

3. Setting

Quotes:
- ""The intervention took place at two different geographical locations (Site A and Site B).""
- ""This study was undertaken in two community leisure setting, this is one of the first studies to utilise this format and, as there is a trend toward longer term rehabilitation and symptom management in the community in the UK, the results of this study are timely.""

Reasoning: The trial was conducted in two community leisure settings, which suggests a more pragmatic approach as it reflects a real-world setting where the intervention might be implemented. However, the fact that the trial was conducted in only two locations may limit the generalizability of the results to other settings.

Score: [4]

4. Organisation

Quotes:
- ""Each group was led by two instructors (one physiotherapist and one fitness instructor). The same physiotherapist was present at both sites; however fitness instructors were different between sites.""
- ""Participants were provided with exercise progress cards and were asked to record which level they performed each exercise at each session.""

Reasoning: The trial required specific resources, including two instructors (a physiotherapist and a fitness instructor) for each group, and exercise progress cards for participants to record their performance. This suggests a more explanatory approach, as it involves a level of organization and resources that may not be available in usual care.

Score: [2]

5. Flexibility (delivery)

Quotes:
- ""The group session involved a 10-minute warm-up of aerobic and stretching components, 30–40 minutes of circuit exercises (Appendix 1 on-line), designed to train aerobic endurance, resistance and balance, and a 5–10 minute cool-down, involving aerobic work, stretching and relaxation.""
- ""Through discussion with the instructors, participants chose which level of each exercise they deemed appropriate and also when and how each exercise should be progressed.""

Reasoning: The intervention was delivered in a structured format, with specific components and durations for each part of the session. However, participants had some flexibility in choosing the level of each exercise and when to progress, suggesting a balance between explanatory and pragmatic approaches.

Score: [3]

6. Flexibility (adherence)

Quotes:
- ""Attendance of participants at each class was recorded.""
- ""Including those who discontinued participation, the total attendance at the classes was 340 sessions out of a possible 480 (71%)""

Reasoning: The trial monitored participants' adherence to the intervention by recording attendance at each class. However, there were no specific measures in place to ensure adherence, suggesting a more pragmatic approach.

Score: [4]

7. Follow-up

Quotes:
- ""Outcome measures were carried out within the local hospital’s rehabilitation unit. They were taken at baseline, after 8 and 12 weeks of the intervention period (i.e. either the exercise class or usual care).""
- ""At week 8 three participants discontinued participation, with missing data for one other. At week 12 one other participant discontinued participation, with missing data for three other participants.""

Reasoning: The trial involved follow-up assessments at specific time points (8 and 12 weeks), and there were instances of missing data due to participants discontinuing participation. This suggests a more explanatory approach, as it involves a level of follow-up that may not be typical in usual care.

Score: [2]

8. Primary outcome

Quotes:
- ""The primary outcome measure was 25-foot (7.6 m) walk time, secondary outcomes assessed walking endurance, balance, physical function, leg strength, body mass index, activity levels, fatigue, anxiety and depression, quality of life and goal attainment.""

Reasoning: The primary outcome of the trial, the 25-foot walk time, is a measure that is directly relevant to participants and reflects a real-world outcome of interest. This suggests a more pragmatic approach.

Score: [5]

9. Primary analysis

Quotes:
- ""All outcome measures were analysed on the basis of intention to treat, with all variables summarized and comparisons made between groups and over time.""
- ""Data were analysed using a univariate general linear model analysis of variance (ANOVA) which allowed for missing data, possible differences over time (baseline, week 8 and week 12) and possible differences between groups (intervention and control) to be assessed.""

Reasoning: The trial used an intention-to-treat analysis, which includes all participants regardless of their adherence to the intervention. This approach is more pragmatic, as it reflects the reality that not all individuals will adhere to an intervention in usual care.

- ""Inclusion criteria were: having MS (MacDonald criteria); being able to complete a questionnaire; and being in need for a multidisciplinary approach, defined by the requirement, in addition to the neurology specialist, of at least two different medical (rehabilitation specialist, neuro-urology specialist, psychiatrist) or allied health professionals (physiotherapist, occupational therapist, social worker, psychologist, and neuropsychologist).""
- ""Patients who were not living independently in the community were excluded.""

Reasoning:
The eligibility criteria for this trial are quite specific, requiring patients to have MS, be able to complete a questionnaire, and be in need of a multidisciplinary approach. This suggests that the trial is not including all patients who might receive the intervention in a usual care setting, but rather a specific subset of patients who meet these criteria. This leans towards an explanatory approach.

Score: [2]

2. Recruitment

Quotes:
- ""MS patients from the outpatient clinic of the Neurology Department of Pitie´-Salpeˆtrie`re Hospital were prospectively enrolled in the study between March 2010 and July 2012.""

Reasoning:
The recruitment process for this trial involved enrolling patients from a specific outpatient clinic, which suggests that the trial may not be representative of all patients who might receive the intervention in a usual care setting. This leans towards an explanatory approach.

Score: [2]

3. Setting

Quotes:
- ""This is a prospective, randomized, controlled, monocentric clinical trial in MS patients.""

Reasoning:
The trial is conducted in a single center, which suggests that the setting may not be representative of all settings where the intervention might be applied in usual care. This leans towards an explanatory approach.

Score: [2]

4. Organisation

Quotes:
- ""Two treatment strategies were compared: (i) an integrated multidisciplinary (IMD) approach, consisting of a half-day individually tailored comprehensive assessment in the MS clinic; and (ii) a standard care.""

Reasoning:
The trial involves comparing an integrated multidisciplinary approach with standard care, suggesting that the organization of care delivery in the trial may not be the same as in usual care. This leans towards an explanatory approach.

Score: [2]

5. Flexibility (delivery)

Quotes:
- ""For patients in the IMD group, the multidisciplinary integrated outpatient clinic was planned at our MS clinic within a maximum three-month period after inclusion.""

Reasoning:
The delivery of the intervention in this trial is quite structured, with a specific timeline for the integrated multidisciplinary approach. This suggests that there may be less flexibility in the delivery of the intervention than in usual care, leaning towards an explanatory approach.

Setting:
- Quote: ""The study was conducted at five sites in Germany, all of which have hippotherapy experience as stipulated by the rules of the German Consortium for Therapeutic Riding.""
The trial was conducted at five sites in Germany, all of which have experience with hippotherapy. This suggests that the trial setting is somewhat pragmatic, as it is conducted in multiple real-world locations where the intervention would likely be applied. However, the requirement for sites to have experience with hippotherapy may limit the generalizability of the results to other settings.

Quotes:
- ""The inclusion criteria were: a positive diagnosis of RA (1987 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria), age 18 years or older and the ability to complete questionnaires unaided.""
- ""Exclusions were: unstabilised concomitant disease, awaiting surgery and already receiving care from the practitioners involved in the study.""

Reasoning: The eligibility criteria for this trial are quite broad, including anyone with a positive diagnosis of RA who is 18 years or older and able to complete questionnaires unaided. The exclusion criteria are also pragmatic, excluding only those with unstabilised concomitant disease, those awaiting surgery, and those already receiving care from the practitioners involved in the study. This suggests that the trial is likely to include a wide range of patients with RA, making it more representative of the general population of RA patients.

2. Recruitment

Quotes:
- ""After gaining patient consent, demographics and disease activity score in 28 joints (DAS28), patients were randomly assigned using a remote secure telephone randomisation service provided by Leeds University Clinical Trials Research Unit.""

Reasoning: The recruitment process for this trial is not explicitly described in the text. However, the use of a remote secure telephone randomisation service suggests that the recruitment process may have been somewhat systematic and potentially more explanatory than pragmatic. Without more information on how patients were initially identified and approached for participation, it is difficult to accurately assess this domain.

Quotes:
- ""Patients were eligible to participate if they were: community dwelling aged ≥65 years; independently mobile (with or without a walking aid); and physically able to take part in group exercise.""
- ""Patients were excluded if they: had experienced ≥3 falls in the previous year; had unstable clinical conditions; would be unable to follow instructions about exercise safely; or were receiving palliative care.""
- ""Attempts were made to exclude those who were already exercising at, or above, the target level through a pre-assessment screening telephone call.""

Reasoning: The eligibility criteria for this trial are quite pragmatic. The trial includes community-dwelling older adults who are independently mobile and physically able to participate in group exercise, which is a broad and inclusive group. However, the trial excludes individuals who have experienced multiple falls in the past year, have unstable clinical conditions, or are unable to follow exercise instructions safely. These exclusions are reasonable and likely reflect the usual care setting, as these individuals may not be suitable candidates for an exercise intervention. The trial also attempts to exclude those already meeting the target level of physical activity, which is a somewhat explanatory feature.

Score: [4]

2. Recruitment

Quotes:
- ""Patients aged ≥65 years were identified by searches of computerised medical records and invited to participate by letter from their GP.""

Reasoning: The recruitment strategy for this trial is somewhat pragmatic. Patients are identified through searches of computerized medical records and invited to participate by their GP, which is a method that could be used in usual care. However, the full text does not provide information on whether additional recruitment strategies were used, such as advertising or incentives, which could potentially reduce the PRECIS-2 score.

3. Setting

Quotes:
- ""Practices were recruited with assistance from Primary Care Research Networks for London, Derby, and Nottingham.""

Reasoning: The trial is conducted in general practices in London, Derby, and Nottingham, which is a typical setting for the delivery of primary care. This suggests a pragmatic approach to the setting domain. However, the full text does not provide information on the specific characteristics of these practices, such as their size, location, or patient population, which could potentially influence the applicability of the trial results.

- ""Volunteer peer mentors supported participants in the OEP arm, and weekly FaME classes were run in local venues by postural stability instructors trained to work with older people.""

Reasoning: The organisation of the trial intervention involves both home-based and group-based exercise programs, which are delivered by trained instructors and supported by volunteer peer mentors. This suggests a somewhat pragmatic approach, as these resources could potentially be available in usual care. However, the use of trained instructors and peer mentors may not be typical in all usual care settings, which could reduce the PRECIS-2 score.

Score: [3]

5. Flexibility (delivery)

Quotes:
- ""The FaME intervention took place in a group once a week and included exercises to be carried out at home, unsupervised, twice weekly. The OEP was undertaken at home, unsupervised, and comprised exercises to be done three times per week.""

Reasoning: The delivery of the trial intervention is quite flexible. The FaME program involves a combination of group classes and unsupervised home exercises, while the OEP is entirely home-based and unsupervised. This suggests a pragmatic approach, as it allows for individual variation in how the intervention is implemented.

Score: [5]

6. Flexibility (adherence)

Quotes:
- ""Adherence was defined as (minutes spent exercising/intended minutes) 100%, where patients with values exceeding 75% were regarded as ‘adherent’.""

Reasoning: The trial measures adherence to the intervention in terms of the proportion of intended exercise minutes completed, with a threshold of 75% for being considered adherent. This suggests a somewhat explanatory approach, as it involves monitoring and quantifying participant adherence, which may not be typical in usual care.

Score: [3]

7. Follow-up

Quotes:
- ""Participants were followed up every 6 months after the end of the intervention period, until 24 months.""
- ""Falls were ascertained from diaries returned by participants every 4 weeks during the intervention and every 3 months in the subsequent year, and from reports given in follow-up telephone interviews using the Phone-FITT questionnaire.""

Reasoning: The follow-up in this trial is somewhat intensive, with participants being followed up every 6 months for 2 years and asked to return diaries every 4 weeks during the intervention and every 3 months thereafter. This suggests a more explanatory approach, as it involves more frequent and extensive data collection than would typically occur in usual care.

Score: [2]

8. Primary outcome

Quotes:
- ""The primary outcome was the proportion of participants who reported reaching ≥150 minutes of MVPA per week.""

Reasoning: The primary outcome of this trial is clearly relevant to participants, as it measures the proportion of participants who achieve a recommended level of physical activity. This suggests a pragmatic approach, as this outcome is likely to be meaningful to both patients and healthcare providers in usual care.

Score: [5]

9. Primary analysis

Quotes:
- ""Participants were analysed in the groups to which they were randomised, regardless of whether they received the intervention or not, and multiple imputation was used to include all participants in the analyses.""

Reasoning: The primary analysis of this trial is an intention-to-treat analysis using all available data, which is a highly pragmatic approach. This analysis includes all participants regardless of whether they received the intervention or not, and uses multiple imputation to account for missing data, which reflects the reality of usual care where not all patients adhere to the intervention and data may be missing.

Score: [5]","1. Eligibility criteria

Quotes:
- ""Patients were eligible to participate if they were: community dwelling aged ≥65 years; independently mobile (with or without a walking aid); and physically able to take part in group exercise.""
- ""Patients were excluded if they: had experienced ≥3 falls in the previous year; had unstable clinical conditions; would be unable to follow instructions about exercise safely; or were receiving palliative care.""
- ""Attempts were made to exclude those who were already exercising at, or above, the target level through a pre-assessment screening telephone call.""

Reasoning: The eligibility criteria for this trial are quite pragmatic. The trial includes community-dwelling older adults who are independently mobile and physically able to participate in group exercise, which is a broad and inclusive group. However, the trial excludes individuals who have experienced multiple falls in the past year, have unstable clinical conditions, or are unable to follow exercise instructions safely. These exclusions are reasonable and likely reflect the usual care setting, as these individuals may not be suitable candidates for an exercise intervention. The trial also attempts to exclude those already meeting the target level of physical activity, which is a somewhat explanatory feature.

Score: [4]

2. Recruitment

Quotes:
- ""Patients aged ≥65 years were identified by searches of computerised medical records and invited to participate by letter from their GP.""

Reasoning: The recruitment strategy for this trial is somewhat pragmatic. Patients are identified through searches of computerized medical records and invited to participate by their GP, which is a method that could be used in usual care. However, the full text does not provide information on whether additional recruitment strategies were used, such as advertising or incentives, which could potentially reduce the PRECIS-2 score.

Score: [4]

3. Setting

Quotes:
- ""Practices were recruited with assistance from Primary Care Research Networks for London, Derby, and Nottingham.""

Reasoning: The trial is conducted in general practices in London, Derby, and Nottingham, which is a typical setting for the delivery of primary care. This suggests a pragmatic approach to the setting domain. However, the full text does not provide information on the specific characteristics of these practices, such as their size, location, or patient population, which could potentially influence the applicability of the trial results.

Score: [4]

4. Organisation

Quotes:
- ""The interventions were the home-based Otago Exercise Programme (OEP), and a group-based exercise programme called Falls Management Exercise (FaME).""
- ""Volunteer peer mentors supported participants in the OEP arm, and weekly FaME classes were run in local venues by postural stability instructors trained to work with older people.""

Reasoning: The organisation of the trial intervention involves both home-based and group-based exercise programs, which are delivered by trained instructors and supported by volunteer peer mentors. This suggests a somewhat pragmatic approach, as these resources could potentially be available in usual care. However, the use of trained instructors and peer mentors may not be typical in all usual care settings, which could reduce the PRECIS-2 score.

Score: [3]

5. Flexibility (delivery)

Quotes:
- ""The FaME intervention took place in a group once a week and included exercises to be carried out at home, unsupervised, twice weekly. The OEP was undertaken at home, unsupervised, and comprised exercises to be done three times per week.""

Reasoning: The delivery of the trial intervention is quite flexible. The FaME program involves a combination of group classes and unsupervised home exercises, while the OEP is entirely home-based and unsupervised. This suggests a pragmatic approach, as it allows for individual variation in how the intervention is implemented.

Score: [5]

6. Flexibility (adherence)

Quotes:
- ""Adherence was defined as (minutes spent exercising/intended minutes) 100%, where patients with values exceeding 75% were regarded as ‘adherent’.""

Reasoning: The trial measures adherence to the intervention in terms of the proportion of intended exercise minutes completed, with a threshold of 75% for being considered adherent. This suggests a somewhat explanatory approach, as it involves monitoring and quantifying participant adherence, which may not be typical in usual care.

Score: [3]

7. Follow-up

Quotes:
- ""Participants were followed up every 6 months after the end of the intervention period, until 24 months.""
- ""Falls were ascertained from diaries returned by participants every 4 weeks during the intervention and every 3 months in the subsequent year, and from reports given in follow-up telephone interviews using the Phone-FITT questionnaire.""

Reasoning: The follow-up in this trial is somewhat intensive, with participants being followed up every 6 months for 2 years and asked to return diaries every 4 weeks during the intervention and every 3 months thereafter. This suggests a more explanatory approach, as it involves more frequent and extensive data collection than would typically occur in usual care.
