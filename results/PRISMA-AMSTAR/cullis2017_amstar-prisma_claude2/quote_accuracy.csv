approach to this anti-reflux procedure is now increasingly favored as

Initial reports of laparoscopic anti-reflux surgery in infants and

thereafter, robot-assisted minimally invasive surgery was first
described in these age groups [4,5], and fundoplication remains the
most prevalently reported application of this technology in pediatric
general surgery [6]. Robotic technology offers putative patient
benefits through a range of features that are felt to enhance the
surgeon’s ability to undertake minimally invasive surgery (MIS).
