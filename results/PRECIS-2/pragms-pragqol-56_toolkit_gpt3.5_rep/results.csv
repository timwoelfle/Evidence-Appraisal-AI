- ""Follow-up was performed in the 6th and 12th week of treatment and 6, 9, and 12 months after the start of treatment."" [6]

The trial included follow-up assessments at multiple time points up to 12 months after the start of treatment. This suggests that the intensity of measurement and follow-up of participants in the trial may have been more extensive than usual care. Therefore, the score for follow-up is: [2]

Primary outcome:
- ""Our results showed a greater improvement in some symptoms of relapse in MS patients after 6 or more weeks in the ACTH-treated patients. This difference did not outlast 6 months in any respect."" [7]

The primary outcome of the trial was the improvement in symptoms of relapse in MS patients. While the text does not explicitly mention the relevance of the primary outcome to participants, it suggests that the improvement in symptoms was not sustained beyond 6 months. This may indicate that the primary outcome was relevant to participants. Therefore, the score for primary outcome is: [4]

Primary analysis:
- ""Mann-Whitney U tests revealed a statistically significant greater improvement in the ACTH group in the brain stem and sensory FS, the ISS and in the Ambulation Index, but at 6 months none of these significant differences were still present."" [7]

The text does not provide explicit information about the analysis of the primary outcome. However, it mentions the use of Mann-Whitney U tests to compare the treatment groups. This suggests that the analysis may have included all available data. Therefore, the score for primary analysis is: [4]"

""The BMCT intervention was developed based on previously published programs5,11,18,19 and according to principle of the task-oriented approach,9 thus addressing salient tasks including sitting (5 minutes), standing (5 minutes), stepping (10 minutes), walking (2 × 10 minutes), and eye-movement training (10 minutes; framework illustrated in Supplemental Appendix)."" [Quote 5]

The flexibility in how the BMCT intervention is delivered seems to be pragmatic. The intervention is based on previously published programs and is designed to address specific tasks related to balance and motor control. The inclusion of different exercises and the ability to tailor the program to individual needs suggests a flexible approach that is likely to reflect usual care.

Score: [5]

Flexibility (adherence):
Score: [NA]

Follow-up:
1. ""The follow-up test was performed within 7 days of the last intervention session or after the last day of being on the waitlist."" [Quote 6]

The intensity of measurement and follow-up in this trial seems to be pragmatic. The follow-up test was conducted within a reasonable timeframe after the intervention or the waitlist period. There is no mention of more frequent or longer visits or unscheduled visits triggered by primary outcome events, suggesting that the follow-up is similar to what would occur in usual care.

Score: [4]

Primary outcome:
1. ""The primary comparisons showed that BMCT, but not PRT, improved T25FW, SSST, and self-perceived gait function when compared to CON."" [Quote 7]

The trial's primary outcome of gait performance seems to be relevant to participants. The results indicate that BMCT had a significant impact on gait performance compared to the control group, while PRT did not. This suggests that the primary outcome is of importance to participants and reflects their experiences in usual care.

Score: [5]

Primary analysis:
1. ""Analyses were carried out as intention-to-treat, where all participants who completed the baseline assessment were included regardless of their adherence to the allocated intervention."" [Quote 8]

The primary analysis of the trial seems to be pragmatic. It was conducted on an intention-to-treat basis, including all participants who completed the baseline assessment, regardless of their adherence to the allocated intervention. This approach reflects the real-world scenario where not all participants may fully adhere to the intervention protocol.

Score: [5]","Eligibility:
1. ""A total of 71 participants with impaired mobility (Timed 25-Foot Walk (T25FW) > 5 seconds or Six Spot Step Test (SSST) > 8 seconds) were enrolled."" [Quote 1]
2. ""The inclusion criteria were as follows: age > 18, confirmed diagnosis of MS, Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS): 2.0–6.5, Six Spot Step Test (SSST) score > 8 seconds or Timed 25-Foot Walk (T25FW) > 5 seconds, relapse-free within the past 8 weeks, and no adjustment of disease-modifying medication or medication that affects gait performance and spasticity within the past 8 weeks."" [Quote 2]
3. ""Exclusion criteria were as follows: co-morbidity in terms of cognitive disorders or alcohol abuse (based on clinical judgment), pathologies that did not allow systematic PRT >1 session/week within the last 3 months."" [Quote 2]

The eligibility criteria for this trial appear to be relatively pragmatic. The inclusion criteria are specific to people with impaired mobility due to multiple sclerosis, but they are not overly restrictive. The exclusion criteria are also reasonable and do not exclude a large portion of the target population. Overall, the trial seems to have a pragmatic approach to participant eligibility.

Recruitment:
1. ""Participants were included from September 2016 to October 2018, after being invited via seven MS clinics (specified in “Acknowledgements” section) and targeted advertisements sent out via the Danish MS Society."" [Quote 3]

The recruitment methods used in this trial seem to be relatively pragmatic. Participants were recruited from multiple MS clinics and through targeted advertisements sent out by the Danish MS Society. This approach is likely to reflect the usual care setting and does not involve excessive efforts to recruit participants.

Score: [4]

Setting:
1. ""A multi-center, single-blinded, cluster-randomized controlled trial with two intervention groups (PRT and BMCT) and a control group (CON)."" [Quote 3]

The trial was conducted at multiple centers, which suggests a pragmatic approach to the setting. This allows for a diverse range of settings that are representative of usual care. However, the specific types of centers (e.g., academic, specialized trial centers) are not mentioned, so it is difficult to fully assess the pragmatism of the setting.

Score: [3]

Organization:
1. ""All training sessions were supervised by physiotherapists who were trained to deliver the intervention."" [Quote 4]

The organization of care delivery in the intervention arm of the trial seems to be pragmatic. The training sessions were supervised by physiotherapists, which is consistent with usual care. There is no mention of additional staff levels, training, or resources beyond what is typically available in usual care.

[1]

The eligibility criteria for this trial appear to be relatively pragmatic. Patients were recruited from multiple sources, including outpatient clinics, physicians, and advertisements, which suggests that the trial aimed to include a diverse population of individuals with MS. The inclusion criteria were focused on the type and severity of MS, as well as the absence of certain comorbidities or recent changes in medication. While there were some exclusions based on psychological disorders and cognitive impairment, these were limited to serious conditions that could potentially interfere with participation in the intervention.

The recruitment methods used in this trial appear to be relatively pragmatic. Patients were able to self-refer to the study, which suggests that the trial aimed to recruit participants who were motivated and interested in participating. However, it is unclear from the text whether any additional efforts were made to actively recruit participants beyond self-referral. The lack of comparisons between refusers and participants also limits our understanding of the recruitment process.

Follow-up:
1. ""The included subjects received a baseline measurement (T0). The second measurement (T1) was performed after the month of usual care (for intervention as well as control group). The third measurement (T2) was performed after the month of H-CAD intervention for the intervention group and 2 months after baseline for the control group. A month after T2 a follow up measurement was performed (T3) for the intervention group. The control group received their last measurement (T3) 4 months after baseline.""

The trial also used relevant outcome measures and included all available data in the primary analysis.","Eligibility:
1. ""Participants were recruited from this register. Participants had a confirmed diagnosis of multiple sclerosis, an Extended Disability Status Scale33 score of 5 (ambulatory without aid or rest for about 200 m) to 6.5 (constant bilateral assistance required to walk about 20 m without resting), stable rehabilitation and drug therapy for 30 days before entry into the study, cognitive scores of over 24 on the Mini-Mental State Examination34 and access to the intervention sites using their own or public transport."" [Score: 4] The eligibility criteria for this trial are moderately pragmatic. They include specific inclusion criteria related to the severity of multiple sclerosis and exclude individuals with recent exacerbations or medical conditions that may preclude them from participating. However, the criteria are not overly restrictive and are likely to include a representative sample of individuals with multiple sclerosis.

Recruitment:
1. ""Of the 873 patients on the clinical register for multiple sclerosis 159 patients were deemed suitable for the study. These people were sent invitation letters and participant information sheets. Forty-three potential participants expressed an interest in participating."" [Score: 4] The recruitment methods used in this trial are moderately pragmatic. The study recruited participants from a clinical register and sent invitation letters to eligible individuals. While this approach may have introduced some selection bias, it is likely to be similar to how participants would be recruited in usual care settings.

Setting:
1. ""The intervention took place at two different geographical locations (Site A and Site B)."" [Score: 4] The setting of this trial is moderately pragmatic. The intervention was conducted in community leisure centers, which are likely to be similar to the usual care settings where individuals with multiple sclerosis would receive exercise interventions.

Organization:
1. ""Participants assigned to the intervention group attended a leisure centre-based exercise class, twice weekly for 12 weeks. Each group was led by two instructors (one physiotherapist and one fitness instructor)."" [Score: 4] The organization of care delivery in this trial is moderately pragmatic. The intervention was delivered by a team of instructors, including a physiotherapist and a fitness instructor, which is likely to be similar to the usual care setting where individuals with multiple sclerosis would receive exercise interventions.

Flexibility (delivery):
1. ""Participants completed a circuit of 8–12 different exercises for 1 minute each, having a rest (of a minimum of 1 minute) before moving to the next exercise. Not all exercises were performed at all classes, and in week 9 a fifth level of difficulty was added to some of the exercises to encourage progress. Instruction cards, with photographs, demonstrating the four different levels of skill/difficulty were used at both sites. Through discussion with the instructors, participants chose which level of each exercise they deemed appropriate and also when and how each exercise should be progressed. Participants worked at a self-regulated pace for each exercise."" [Score: 4] The flexibility in how the intervention is delivered in this trial is moderately pragmatic. Participants had the flexibility to choose the level of difficulty for each exercise and progress at their own pace. The intervention also included variations in exercise difficulty and allowed participants to self-regulate their pace.

Flexibility (adherence):
1. ""Participants assigned to the control group were advised to continue their usual routine, seeking any healthcare as required. They were asked to avoid beginning any new exercise regime for the 12 weeks of the study."" [Score: 5] The flexibility in how participants must adhere to the intervention in this trial is very pragmatic. The control group was not required to make any changes to their usual routine and were only asked to avoid starting a new exercise regime during the study.

Follow-up:
1. ""Outcome measures were carried out within the local hospital’s rehabilitation unit. They were taken at baseline, after 8 and 12 weeks of the intervention period (i.e. either the exercise class or usual care)."" [Score: 4] The intensity of measurement and follow-up in this trial is moderately pragmatic. Outcome measures were collected at baseline, after 8 weeks, and after 12 weeks, which is likely to be similar to the follow-up schedule in usual care settings.

Primary outcome:
1. ""The primary outcome measure was 25-foot (7.6 m) walk time."" [Score: 5] The primary outcome measure in this trial is very pragmatic. The 25-foot walk time is a relevant and meaningful outcome measure for individuals with multiple sclerosis.

Primary analysis:
1. ""Data were analysed using a univariate general linear model analysis of variance (ANOVA) which allowed for missing data, possible differences over time (baseline, week 8 and week 12) and possible differences between groups (intervention and control) to be assessed."" [Score: 5] The primary analysis in this trial is very pragmatic. The analysis included all available data and used a general linear model that accounted for missing data and assessed differences over time and between groups.

Overall, this trial demonstrates a moderately to very pragmatic approach in most of the PRECIS-2 domains. The trial included a representative sample of individuals with multiple sclerosis, recruited participants through usual care channels, conducted the intervention in community leisure centers, and allowed flexibility in the delivery and adherence to the intervention. The trial also used relevant outcome measures and included all available data in the primary analysis."

1. ""Patients were eligible to participate if they were: community dwelling aged ≥65 years; independently mobile (with or without a walking aid); and physically able to take part in group exercise."" [1]
2. ""Patients were excluded if they: had experienced ≥3 falls in the previous year; had unstable clinical conditions; would be unable to follow instructions about exercise safely; or were receiving palliative care."" [1]

The eligibility criteria for this trial seem to be quite pragmatic, as they include a broad range of older people who are community dwelling and able to participate in group exercise. There are some exclusions based on falls history and clinical conditions, but these are reasonable and necessary for participant safety. Score: [4]

Recruitment:
1. ""Practices were recruited with assistance from Primary Care Research Networks for London, Derby, and Nottingham. Patients aged ≥65 years were identified by searches of computerised medical records and invited to participate by letter from their GP."" [1]

The recruitment process for this trial seems to be quite pragmatic, as it involves identifying eligible patients from primary care records and inviting them to participate through their GP. This is a common and feasible approach that would be used in usual care. Score: [5]

Setting:
1. ""Pragmatic three-arm, parallel-design cluster randomised controlled trial involving 1256 people aged ≥65 years (of 20 507 invited) recruited from 43 general practices in London, Nottingham, and Derby."" [1]

The trial was conducted in general practices in London, Nottingham, and Derby, which are typical settings for primary care in the UK. This is a pragmatic choice that reflects the usual care setting. Score: [5]

Organisation:
1. ""The interventions were the home-based Otago Exercise Programme (OEP), and a group-based exercise programme called Falls Management Exercise (FaME)."" [1]
2. ""Volunteer peer mentors supported participants in the OEP arm, and weekly FaME classes were run in local venues by postural stability instructors trained to work with older people."" [1]

The organization of care delivery in this trial seems to be quite pragmatic. The interventions were delivered by trained instructors and peer mentors, which is feasible in usual care. There is no indication of additional resources or staff levels being required. Score: [5]

Flexibility (delivery):
1. ""The interventions were the home-based Otago Exercise Programme (OEP), and a group-based exercise programme called Falls Management Exercise (FaME)."" [1]
2. ""The programmes included the following progression: OEP — ankle weights and hand holds; and FaME — resistance bands and hand holds, plus a move to more dynamic balance work and floor work with postural stability instructors."" [1]

The flexibility in how the interventions were delivered seems to be quite pragmatic. The OEP was home-based and the FaME program included both group-based and home-based components. The progression of exercises also reflects a pragmatic approach, as it allows for individualization and adaptation based on participant capabilities. Score: [4]

Flexibility (adherence):
1. ""Adherence was defined as (minutes spent exercising/intended minutes) 100%, where patients with values exceeding 75% were regarded as ‘adherent’."" [1]

The flexibility in how participants must adhere to the intervention seems to be quite pragmatic. Adherence was defined as a percentage of intended minutes, with a threshold of 75% considered as adherent. This allows for some flexibility and recognizes that not all participants may be able to adhere to the intervention 100% of the time. Score: [5]

Follow-up:
1. ""Participants were followed up every 6 months after the end of the intervention period, until 24 months."" [1]

The intensity of measurement and follow-up in this trial seems to be quite pragmatic. Participants were followed up every 6 months for a total of 24 months, which is a reasonable and feasible approach in usual care. Score: [5]

Primary outcome:
1. ""The primary outcome was the proportion of participants who reported reaching ≥150 minutes of MVPA per week."" [1]

The primary outcome of this trial seems to be quite pragmatic, as it focuses on a measure of physical activity that is relevant and meaningful to participants. Score: [5]

Primary analysis:
1. ""Participants were analysed in the groups to which they were randomised, regardless of whether they received the intervention or not, and multiple imputation was used to include all participants in the analyses."" [1]

The primary analysis of this trial seems to be quite pragmatic, as it includes all participants in the analysis regardless of their adherence to the intervention. Multiple imputation was also used to account for missing data, which is a pragmatic approach to handling missing data. Score: [5]","Eligibility:
