AMSTAR:
A1. Was an 'a priori' design provided? The research question and inclusion criteria should be established before the conduct of the review. Note: Need to refer to a protocol, ethics approval, or pre-determined/a priori published research objectives to score a “yes.”
[Yes] ""To evaluate the available evidence for both benefits and harms of the currently available treatment options for primary VUR: operative, non-operative or no intervention."" (Objectives)
The review had predefined objectives, inclusion criteria, and outcomes.

A2. Was there duplicate study selection and data extraction? There should be at least two independent data extractors and a consensus procedure for disagreements should be in place. Note: 2 people do study selection, 2 people do data extraction, consensus process or one person checks the other’s work.
[Yes] ""Two authors independently searched the literature, determined study eligibility, assessed quality, extracted and entered data."" (Methods)
Two authors independently performed study selection and data extraction.

A3. Was a comprehensive literature search performed? At least two electronic sources should be searched. The report must include years and databases used (e.g., Central, EMBASE, and MEDLINE). Key words and/or MESH terms must be stated and where feasible the search strategy should be provided. All searches should be supplemented by consulting current contents, reviews, textbooks, specialized registers, or experts in the particular field of study, and by reviewing the references in the studies found. Note: If at least 2 sources + one supplementary strategy used, select “yes” (Cochrane register/Central counts as 2 sources; a grey literature search counts as supplementary).
[Yes] ""In August 2010 we searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE and EMBASE and screened reference lists of papers and abstracts from conference proceedings."" (Results)
The review searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and EMBASE, screened reference lists, and searched conference abstracts. 

A4. Was the status of publication (i.e. grey literature) used as an inclusion criterion? The authors should state that they searched for reports regardless of their publication type. The authors should state whether or not they excluded any reports (from the systematic review), based on their publication status, language etc. Note: If review indicates that there was a search for “grey literature” or “unpublished literature,” indicate “yes.” SIGLE database, dissertations, conference proceedings, and trial registries are all considered grey for this purpose. If searching a source that contains both grey and non-grey, must specify that they were searching for grey/unpublished lit.
[Yes] ""We captured two studies by screening reference lists of the authors. Both studies were published in conference proceedings only (Morris 1991; Reddy 1997)."" (Results)
The review searched conference abstracts/proceedings for unpublished studies.

A5. Was a list of studies (included and excluded) provided? A list of included and excluded studies should be provided. Note: Acceptable if the excluded studies are referenced. If there is an electronic link to the list but the link is dead, select “no.”
[Yes] The review provided aCharacteristics of included studies and Characteristics of excluded studies table listing all included and excluded studies.

A6. Were the characteristics of the included studies provided? In an aggregated form such as a table, data from the original studies should be provided on the participants, interventions and outcomes. The ranges of characteristics in all the studies analyzed e.g., age, race, sex, relevant socioeconomic data, disease status, duration, severity, or other diseases should be reported. Note: Acceptable if not in table format as long as they are described as above. Paul ""Follow-up poorly reported in general""
[Yes] The review provided a Characteristics of included studies table with details on the participants, interventions, and outcomes for each included study.

A7. Was the scientific quality of the included studies assessed and documented? 'A priori' methods of assessment should be provided (e.g., for effectiveness studies if the author(s) chose to include only randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled studies, or allocation concealment as inclusion criteria); for other types of studies alternative items will be relevant. Note: Can include use of a quality scoring tool or checklist, e.g., Jadad scale, risk of bias, sensitivity analysis, etc., or a description of quality items, with some kind of result for EACH study (“low” or “high” is fine, as long as it is clear which studies scored “low” and which scored “high”; a summary score/range for all studies is not acceptable).
[Yes] The review used the Cochrane risk of bias tool to assess each included study for risk of bias in sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding, incomplete outcome data, selective reporting, and other sources of bias. A risk of bias summary and graph are provided.

A8. Was the scientific quality of the included studies used appropriately in formulating conclusions? The results of the methodological rigor and scientific quality should be considered in the analysis and the conclusions of the review, and explicitly stated in formulating recommendations. Note: Might say something such as “the results should be interpreted with caution due to poor quality of included studies.” Cannot score “yes” for this question if scored “no” for question A7.
[Yes] The review discussed limitations of the quality of evidence in the Discussion section, such as concerns about bias due to lack of blinding.

A9. Were the methods used to combine the findings of studies appropriate? For the pooled results, a test should be done to ensure the studies were combinable, to assess their homogeneity (i.e., Chi-squared test for homogeneity, I2 ). If heterogeneity exists a random effects model should be used and/or the clinical appropriateness of combining should be taken into consideration (i.e., is it sensible to combine?). Note: Indicate “yes” if they mention or describe heterogeneity, i.e., if they explain that they cannot pool because of heterogeneity/variability between interventions.
[Yes] ""Heterogeneity between studies was analysed using the Cochran's Q statistic with the threshold for statistical significance set at alpha = 0.1 (Lau 1997). It was also tested by means of the IS test, reflecting the percentage of total variation across studies that could be ascribed to heterogeneity (Higgins 2003)."" A random effects model was used.

A10. Was the likelihood of publication bias assessed? An assessment of publication bias should include a combination of graphical aids (e.g., funnel plot, other available tests) and/or statistical tests (e.g., Egger regression test, Hedges-Olken). Note: If no test values or funnel plot included, score “no”. Score “yes” if mentions that publication bias could not be assessed because there were fewer than 10 included studies.
[No] Publication bias was not assessed. The review stated: ""There were insufficient studies to explore potential effect modification using subgroup analysis or meta-regression.""

A11. Was the conflict of interest included? Potential sources of support should be clearly acknowledged in both the systematic review and the included studies. Note: To get a “yes,” must indicate source of funding or support for the systematic review AND for each of the included studies.. 
[Yes] Sources of support were reported for the review and included studies. No conflicts of interest were reported.

In summary, the review met 10/11 AMSTAR criteria. The only criteria not met was assessment of publication bias, which was likely not done due to the small number of included studies. Overall, this systematic review was conducted with rigorous methodology.

In summary, this systematic review adhered well to the PRISMA guidelines. The only items not addressed were a protocol, assessment of publication bias, and additional analyses - which were likely not done due to the limited data. Otherwise, the review was very comprehensive in its reporting.

In conclusion, this systematic review had good methodology overall following AMSTAR and PRISMA guidelines. The main limitations were the lack of assessment for publication bias and limited additional analyses, which is understandable given the small number of studies. The review provides moderately strong evidence regarding the benefits and harms of interventions for vesicoureteral reflux in children. The authors' conclusions appear appropriate based on the evidence presented.
"," Here are the AMSTAR and PRISMA assessments for the systematic review:

AMSTAR:
A1. Was an 'a priori' design provided? The research question and inclusion criteria should be established before the conduct of the review. Note: Need to refer to a protocol, ethics approval, or pre-determined/a priori published research objectives to score a “yes.”
[Yes] ""To evaluate the available evidence for both benefits and harms of the currently available treatment options for primary VUR: operative, non-operative or no intervention."" (Objectives)
The review had predefined objectives, inclusion criteria, and outcomes.

A2. Was there duplicate study selection and data extraction? There should be at least two independent data extractors and a consensus procedure for disagreements should be in place. Note: 2 people do study selection, 2 people do data extraction, consensus process or one person checks the other’s work.
[Yes] ""Two authors independently searched the literature, determined study eligibility, assessed quality, extracted and entered data."" (Methods)
Two authors independently performed study selection and data extraction.

A3. Was a comprehensive literature search performed? At least two electronic sources should be searched. The report must include years and databases used (e.g., Central, EMBASE, and MEDLINE). Key words and/or MESH terms must be stated and where feasible the search strategy should be provided. All searches should be supplemented by consulting current contents, reviews, textbooks, specialized registers, or experts in the particular field of study, and by reviewing the references in the studies found. Note: If at least 2 sources + one supplementary strategy used, select “yes” (Cochrane register/Central counts as 2 sources; a grey literature search counts as supplementary).
[Yes] ""In August 2010 we searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE and EMBASE and screened reference lists of papers and abstracts from conference proceedings."" (Results)
The review searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and EMBASE, screened reference lists, and searched conference abstracts. 

A4. Was the status of publication (i.e. grey literature) used as an inclusion criterion? The authors should state that they searched for reports regardless of their publication type. The authors should state whether or not they excluded any reports (from the systematic review), based on their publication status, language etc. Note: If review indicates that there was a search for “grey literature” or “unpublished literature,” indicate “yes.” SIGLE database, dissertations, conference proceedings, and trial registries are all considered grey for this purpose. If searching a source that contains both grey and non-grey, must specify that they were searching for grey/unpublished lit.
[Yes] ""We captured two studies by screening reference lists of the authors. Both studies were published in conference proceedings only (Morris 1991; Reddy 1997)."" (Results)
The review searched conference abstracts/proceedings for unpublished studies.

A5. Was a list of studies (included and excluded) provided? A list of included and excluded studies should be provided. Note: Acceptable if the excluded studies are referenced. If there is an electronic link to the list but the link is dead, select “no.”
[Yes] The review provided aCharacteristics of included studies and Characteristics of excluded studies table listing all included and excluded studies.

A6. Were the characteristics of the included studies provided? In an aggregated form such as a table, data from the original studies should be provided on the participants, interventions and outcomes. The ranges of characteristics in all the studies analyzed e.g., age, race, sex, relevant socioeconomic data, disease status, duration, severity, or other diseases should be reported. Note: Acceptable if not in table format as long as they are described as above. Paul ""Follow-up poorly reported in general""
[Yes] The review provided a Characteristics of included studies table with details on the participants, interventions, and outcomes for each included study.

A7. Was the scientific quality of the included studies assessed and documented? 'A priori' methods of assessment should be provided (e.g., for effectiveness studies if the author(s) chose to include only randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled studies, or allocation concealment as inclusion criteria); for other types of studies alternative items will be relevant. Note: Can include use of a quality scoring tool or checklist, e.g., Jadad scale, risk of bias, sensitivity analysis, etc., or a description of quality items, with some kind of result for EACH study (“low” or “high” is fine, as long as it is clear which studies scored “low” and which scored “high”; a summary score/range for all studies is not acceptable).
[Yes] The review used the Cochrane risk of bias tool to assess each included study for risk of bias in sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding, incomplete outcome data, selective reporting, and other sources of bias. A risk of bias summary and graph are provided.

A8. Was the scientific quality of the included studies used appropriately in formulating conclusions? The results of the methodological rigor and scientific quality should be considered in the analysis and the conclusions of the review, and explicitly stated in formulating recommendations. Note: Might say something such as “the results should be interpreted with caution due to poor quality of included studies.” Cannot score “yes” for this question if scored “no” for question A7.
[Yes] The review discussed limitations of the quality of evidence in the Discussion section, such as concerns about bias due to lack of blinding.

A9. Were the methods used to combine the findings of studies appropriate? For the pooled results, a test should be done to ensure the studies were combinable, to assess their homogeneity (i.e., Chi-squared test for homogeneity, I2 ). If heterogeneity exists a random effects model should be used and/or the clinical appropriateness of combining should be taken into consideration (i.e., is it sensible to combine?). Note: Indicate “yes” if they mention or describe heterogeneity, i.e., if they explain that they cannot pool because of heterogeneity/variability between interventions.

It was also tested by means of the IS test, reflecting the percentage of total variation across studies that could be ascribed to heterogeneity (Higgins 2003)."" A random effects model was used.

A10. Was the likelihood of publication bias assessed? An assessment of publication bias should include a combination of graphical aids (e.g., funnel plot, other available tests) and/or statistical tests (e.g., Egger regression test, Hedges-Olken). Note: If no test values or funnel plot included, score “no”. Score “yes” if mentions that publication bias could not be assessed because there were fewer than 10 included studies.
[No] Publication bias was not assessed. The review stated: ""There were insufficient studies to explore potential effect modification using subgroup analysis or meta-regression.""

In summary, based on the AMSTAR assessment, this systematic review has some methodological shortcomings related to duplicate study selection/data extraction, literature search, incorporation of quality assessment into conclusions, and assessment of publication bias. The reporting quality based on PRISMA also has some deficiencies, including lack of protocol and search strategy details. Overall, this review could be improved with more rigorous methodology and transparent reporting.

</file-attachment-contents>

Thank you for the comprehensive assessment using the AMSTAR and PRISMA tools. You have highlighted several limitations in the methodology and reporting of this systematic review. The lack of duplicate study selection/data extraction, limited literature searching, and no assessment of publication bias per AMSTAR are concerning. Not providing the full search strategy per PRISMA also reduces reproducibility. Your analysis provides helpful insights on improving systematic review conduct and reporting quality. Assessing rigor is a key step before using findings to inform evidence-based practice.

In summary, based on the AMSTAR assessment, this systematic review has some methodological shortcomings related to duplicate study selection/data extraction, literature search, incorporation of quality assessment into conclusions, and assessment of publication bias. The reporting quality based on PRISMA also has some deficiencies, including lack of protocol and search strategy details. Overall, this review could be improved with more rigorous methodology and transparent reporting.

</file-attachment-contents>

Thank you for the comprehensive assessment using the AMSTAR and PRISMA tools. You have highlighted several limitations in the methodology and reporting of this systematic review. The lack of duplicate study selection/data extraction, limited literature searching, and no assessment of publication bias per AMSTAR are concerning. Not providing the full search strategy per PRISMA also reduces reproducibility. Your analysis provides helpful insights on improving systematic review conduct and reporting quality. Assessing rigor is a key step before using findings to inform evidence-based practice.

# AMSTAR
A1. Was an 'a priori' design provided? The research question and inclusion criteria should be established before the conduct of the review. Note: Need to refer to a protocol, ethics approval, or pre-determined/a priori published research objectives to score a “yes.”
""[No]"" - No mention of protocol or pre-determined objectives.

A2. Was there duplicate study selection and data extraction? There should be at least two independent data extractors and a consensus procedure for disagreements should be in place. Note: 2 people do study selection, 2 people do data extraction, consensus process or one person checks the other’s work.  
""[No]"" - No mention of duplicate study selection or data extraction process.

A3. Was a comprehensive literature search performed? At least two electronic sources should be searched. The report must include years and databases used (e.g., Central, EMBASE, and MEDLINE). Key words and/or MESH terms must be stated and where feasible the search strategy should be provided. All searches should be supplemented by consulting current contents, reviews, textbooks, specialized registers, or experts in the particular field of study, and by reviewing the references in the studies found. Note: If at least 2 sources + one supplementary strategy used, select “yes” (Cochrane register/Central counts as 2 sources; a grey literature search counts as supplementary).
""[Yes]"" - Searched MEDLINE, EMbase, Google Scholar. Also searched journals and reference lists.""

A4. Was the status of publication (i.e. grey literature) used as an inclusion criterion? The authors should state that they searched for reports regardless of their publication type. The authors should state whether or not they excluded any reports (from the systematic review), based on their publication status, language etc. Note: If review indicates that there was a search for “grey literature” or “unpublished literature,” indicate “yes.” SIGLE database, dissertations, conference proceedings, and trial registries are all considered grey for this purpose. If searching a source that contains both grey and non-grey, must specify that they were searching for grey/unpublished lit.  
""[No]"" - No mention of including or searching for grey literature.

A5. Was a list of studies (included and excluded) provided? A list of included and excluded studies should be provided. Note: Acceptable if the excluded studies are referenced. If there is an electronic link to the list but the link is dead, select “no.”
""[No]"" - No list of excluded studies provided. 

A6. Were the characteristics of the included studies provided? In an aggregated form such as a table, data from the original studies should be provided on the participants, interventions and outcomes. The ranges of characteristics in all the studies analyzed e.g., age, race, sex, relevant socioeconomic data, disease status, duration, severity, or other diseases should be reported. Note: Acceptable if not in table format as long as they are described as above. Paul ""Follow-up poorly reported in general""
""[Yes]"" - Table 1 provides characteristics of included studies. Follow-up duration is poorly reported.

A7. Was the scientific quality of the included studies assessed and documented? 'A priori' methods of assessment should be provided (e.g., for effectiveness studies if the author(s) chose to include only randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled studies, or allocation concealment as inclusion criteria); for other types of studies alternative items will be relevant. Note: Can include use of a quality scoring tool or checklist, e.g., Jadad scale, risk of bias, sensitivity analysis, etc., or a description of quality items, with some kind of result for EACH study (“low” or “high” is fine, as long as it is clear which studies scored “low” and which scored “high”; a summary score/range for all studies is not acceptable).  
""[No]"" - No quality assessment of included studies.

A8. Was the scientific quality of the included studies used appropriately in formulating conclusions? The results of the methodological rigor and scientific quality should be considered in the analysis and the conclusions of the review, and explicitly stated in formulating recommendations. Note: Might say something such as “the results should be interpreted with caution due to poor quality of included studies.” Cannot score “yes” for this question if scored “no” for question A7.  
""[No]"" - Did not assess quality of included studies.

A9. Were the methods used to combine the findings of studies appropriate? For the pooled results, a test should be done to ensure the studies were combinable, to assess their homogeneity (i.e., Chi-squared test for homogeneity, I2 ). If heterogeneity exists a random effects model should be used and/or the clinical appropriateness of combining should be taken into consideration (i.e., is it sensible to combine?). Note: Indicate “yes” if they mention or describe heterogeneity, i.e., if they explain that they cannot pool because of heterogeneity/variability between interventions.
""[NA]"" - No meta-analysis performed.

A10. Was the likelihood of publication bias assessed? An assessment of publication bias should include a combination of graphical aids (e.g., funnel plot, other available tests) and/or statistical tests (e.g., Egger regression test, Hedges-Olken). Note: If no test values or funnel plot included, score “no”. Score “yes” if mentions that publication bias could not be assessed because there were fewer than 10 included studies.  
""[NA]"" - No meta-analysis performed.

A11. Was the conflict of interest included? Potential sources of support should be clearly acknowledged in both the systematic review and the included studies. Note: To get a “yes,” must indicate source of funding or support for the systematic review AND for each of the included studies.

""Pediatric emergency department thoracotomy: A large case series and systematic review"" (Title)

Reasoning: Identified as a systematic review. 

[Yes]

P2.  
Quotes:
""a b s t r a c t [...] Background/purpose: The emergency department thoracotomy (EDT) is rarely utilized in children, and is thus difficult to identify survival factors. We reviewed our experience and performed a systematic review of reports of EDT in pediatric patients. Methods: Patients age ≤18 years who received an EDT from 1991 to 2012 at our institution and all published case series were reviewed. Data analyzed include age, sex, mechanism of injury (MOI), injury patterns, presence of vital signs (VS) or signs of life (SOL) in the field/ED, return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC), and survival. Results: A total of 252 patients were analyzed. 84% were male. 51% sustained penetrating injuries, and median age was 15 years. Upon arrival, 17% had VS, and 35% had SOL. After EDT, 30% experienced ROSC. The survival rate was 1.6% for blunt trauma, 10.2% for penetrating injuries, and 6.0% overall. Conclusion: Survival of pediatric patients following EDT is comparable to recent analyses in adults. Children who sustain blunt injury and are without SOL have been uniformly unsalvageable. Children who sustain penetrating trauma and have SOL or are without SOL for a short time prior to arrival have been salvageable. There are no reported EDT survivors less than 14 years of age following blunt injury."" (Abstract)

P3.  
Quotes:  
""The emergency department thoracotomy (EDT) is rarely utilized in children, and is thus difficult to identify survival factors."" (Introduction)

""With recent reports showing the detrimental outcomes associated with a prolonged pre-hospital period, there has been a push for emergency medical services in urban environments to “scoop and run” rather than “stay and play” [17,18]. Many of these patients in the past would have been pronounced dead at the scene or at their community hospital emergency department. During this development, the resuscitative thoracotomy was also added as an extension to ATLS techniques [19]. Now after 30 years, we are able to systematically review the current literature with this relatively aggressive resuscitative measure in the pediatric population."" (Introduction)

A1. Was an 'a priori' design provided? The research question and inclusion criteria should be established before the conduct of the review.

Relevant quotes:
""A systematic review of all publications on the laparoscopic treatment of pediatric intussusception from January 1990 to April 2012 was performed.""
""Exclusion criteria were non-English language articles, case reports, laparoscopic-assisted enema reduction and mixed pediatric and adult populations (age cutoff 18 years).""

Reasoning: The authors specified the research question, inclusion/exclusion criteria, and timeframe for study selection prior to conducting the review.

[Yes]

A2. Was there duplicate study selection and data extraction? There should be at least two independent data extractors and a consensus procedure for disagreements should be in place. 

Relevant quotes: None provided.

Reasoning: The authors did not report on the process for study selection and data extraction.

[No]

A3. Was a comprehensive literature search performed? At least two electronic sources should be searched. The report must include years and databases used (e.g., Central, EMBASE, and MEDLINE). Key words and/or MESH terms must be stated and where feasible the search strategy should be provided. All searches should be supplemented by consulting current contents, reviews, textbooks, specialized registers, or experts in the particular field of study, and by reviewing the references in the studies found. 

Relevant quotes: 
""An online database search for all English language articles on pediatric small bowel obstruction, intussusception and laparoscopy in PubMed, Medline and Ovid from January 1990 to April 2012 was performed.""
""Results were confirmed by a second independent search by a different member of the team using matching search strings and databases.""
""Likewise, the bibliographies of identified studies were examined.""

Reasoning: The authors searched at least 2 databases, supplemented searches with bibliography review, but did not report search terms or strategies. 

[No]

A4. Was the status of publication (i.e. grey literature) used as an inclusion criterion? The authors should state that they searched for reports regardless of their publication type. The authors should state whether or not they excluded any reports (from the systematic review), based on their publication status, language etc. 

Relevant quotes: 
""Exclusion criteria were non-English language articles, case reports, laparoscopic-assisted enema reduction and mixed pediatric and adult populations (age cutoff 18 years).""

Reasoning: The authors excluded non-English studies, but did not report on inclusion/exclusion based on other publication types.

[No] 

A5. Was a list of studies (included and excluded) provided? A list of included and excluded studies should be provided.

Relevant quotes: Figure 1 shows included studies, but no excluded studies are listed. 

Reasoning: A list of included studies was provided, but not excluded studies.

[No]

A6. Were the characteristics of the included studies provided? In an aggregated form such as a table, data from the original studies should be provided on the participants, interventions and outcomes. The ranges of characteristics in all the studies analyzed e.g., age, race, sex, relevant socioeconomic data, disease status, duration, severity, or other diseases should be reported.

Relevant quotes: 
""Table 1 provides specific details on the selected studies.""
""Overall, 10 studies were identified which included a total of 276 cases of laparoscopically treated intussusception.""

Reasoning: Table 1 and the results section provide aggregated details on the participants, interventions, and outcomes.

[Yes]

A7. Was the scientific quality of the included studies assessed and documented? 'A priori' methods of assessment should be provided (e.g., for effectiveness studies if the author(s) chose to include only randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled studies, or allocation concealment as inclusion criteria); for other types of studies alternative items will be relevant.

Relevant quotes: None provided. 

Reasoning: The authors did not report assessing the quality of included studies.

[No]

A8. Was the scientific quality of the included studies used appropriately in formulating conclusions? The results of the methodological rigor and scientific quality should be considered in the analysis and the conclusions of the review, and explicitly stated in formulating recommendations.

Relevant quotes: None provided.

Reasoning: Study quality was not assessed.

[NA]

A9. Were the methods used to combine the findings of studies appropriate? For the pooled results, a test should be done to ensure the studies were combinable, to assess their homogeneity (i.e., Chi-squared test for homogeneity, I2). If heterogeneity exists a random effects model should be used and/or the clinical appropriateness of combining should be taken into consideration (i.e., is it sensible to combine?).

Relevant quotes: 
""Owing to the absence of any randomized controlled trials and the heterogeneous nature of studies, a formal meta-analysis was not performed.""

Reasoning: The authors did not perform a meta-analysis due to heterogeneity.

[NA]

A10. Was the likelihood of publication bias assessed? An assessment of publication bias should include a combination of graphical aids (e.g., funnel plot, other available tests) and/or statistical tests (e.g., Egger regression test, Hedges-Olken). 

Relevant quotes: None provided.

Reasoning: Publication bias was not assessed.

[No]

A11. Was the conflict of interest included? Potential sources of support should be clearly acknowledged in both the systematic review and the included studies.

Relevant quotes: None provided.

Reasoning: Sources of support were not reported for the review or included studies. 

[No]

In summary, for the AMSTAR quality assessment, there were deficiencies in the reporting of the review methods, inclusion of grey literature, provision of excluded studies, assessment of study quality, assessment of publication bias, and reporting of conflicts of interest.

Thank you for this valuable assessment opportunity and experience. Please let me know if I can elaborate or explain any part of my review. I look forward to your feedback.
"," Here are my responses for assessing the methodological quality of this systematic review using the AMSTAR tool:

A1. Was an 'a priori' design provided? The research question and inclusion criteria should be established before the conduct of the review.

Relevant quotes:
""A systematic review of all publications on the laparoscopic treatment of pediatric intussusception from January 1990 to April 2012 was performed.""
""Exclusion criteria were non-English language articles, case reports, laparoscopic-assisted enema reduction and mixed pediatric and adult populations (age cutoff 18 years).""

Reasoning: The authors specified the research question, inclusion/exclusion criteria, and timeframe for study selection prior to conducting the review.

[Yes]

A2. Was there duplicate study selection and data extraction? There should be at least two independent data extractors and a consensus procedure for disagreements should be in place. 

Relevant quotes: None provided.

Reasoning: The authors did not report on the process for study selection and data extraction.

[No]

A3. Was a comprehensive literature search performed? At least two electronic sources should be searched. The report must include years and databases used (e.g., Central, EMBASE, and MEDLINE). Key words and/or MESH terms must be stated and where feasible the search strategy should be provided. All searches should be supplemented by consulting current contents, reviews, textbooks, specialized registers, or experts in the particular field of study, and by reviewing the references in the studies found. 

Relevant quotes: 
""An online database search for all English language articles on pediatric small bowel obstruction, intussusception and laparoscopy in PubMed, Medline and Ovid from January 1990 to April 2012 was performed.""
""Results were confirmed by a second independent search by a different member of the team using matching search strings and databases.""
""Likewise, the bibliographies of identified studies were examined.""

Reasoning: The authors searched at least 2 databases, supplemented searches with bibliography review, but did not report search terms or strategies. 

[No]

A4. Was the status of publication (i.e. grey literature) used as an inclusion criterion? The authors should state that they searched for reports regardless of their publication type. The authors should state whether or not they excluded any reports (from the systematic review), based on their publication status, language etc. 

Relevant quotes: 
""Exclusion criteria were non-English language articles, case reports, laparoscopic-assisted enema reduction and mixed pediatric and adult populations (age cutoff 18 years).""

Reasoning: The authors excluded non-English studies, but did not report on inclusion/exclusion based on other publication types.

[No] 

A5. Was a list of studies (included and excluded) provided? A list of included and excluded studies should be provided.

Relevant quotes: Figure 1 shows included studies, but no excluded studies are listed. 

Reasoning: A list of included studies was provided, but not excluded studies.

[No]

A6. Were the characteristics of the included studies provided? In an aggregated form such as a table, data from the original studies should be provided on the participants, interventions and outcomes. The ranges of characteristics in all the studies analyzed e.g., age, race, sex, relevant socioeconomic data, disease status, duration, severity, or other diseases should be reported.

Relevant quotes: 
""Table 1 provides specific details on the selected studies.""
""Overall, 10 studies were identified which included a total of 276 cases of laparoscopically treated intussusception.""

Reasoning: Table 1 and the results section provide aggregated details on the participants, interventions, and outcomes.

[Yes]

A7. Was the scientific quality of the included studies assessed and documented? 'A priori' methods of assessment should be provided (e.g., for effectiveness studies if the author(s) chose to include only randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled studies, or allocation concealment as inclusion criteria); for other types of studies alternative items will be relevant.

Relevant quotes: None provided. 

Reasoning: The authors did not report assessing the quality of included studies.

[No]

A8. Was the scientific quality of the included studies used appropriately in formulating conclusions? The results of the methodological rigor and scientific quality should be considered in the analysis and the conclusions of the review, and explicitly stated in formulating recommendations.

Relevant quotes: None provided.

Reasoning: Study quality was not assessed.

[NA]

A9. Were the methods used to combine the findings of studies appropriate? For the pooled results, a test should be done to ensure the studies were combinable, to assess their homogeneity (i.e., Chi-squared test for homogeneity, I2). If heterogeneity exists a random effects model should be used and/or the clinical appropriateness of combining should be taken into consideration (i.e., is it sensible to combine?).

Relevant quotes: 
""Owing to the absence of any randomized controlled trials and the heterogeneous nature of studies, a formal meta-analysis was not performed.""

Reasoning: The authors did not perform a meta-analysis due to heterogeneity.

[NA]

A10. Was the likelihood of publication bias assessed? An assessment of publication bias should include a combination of graphical aids (e.g., funnel plot, other available tests) and/or statistical tests (e.g., Egger regression test, Hedges-Olken). 

Relevant quotes: None provided.

Reasoning: Publication bias was not assessed.

[No]

A11. Was the conflict of interest included? Potential sources of support should be clearly acknowledged in both the systematic review and the included studies.

Relevant quotes: None provided.

Reasoning: Sources of support were not reported for the review or included studies. 

[No]

In summary, for the AMSTAR quality assessment, there were deficiencies in the reporting of the review methods, inclusion of grey literature, provision of excluded studies, assessment of study quality, assessment of publication bias, and reporting of conflicts of interest.

A1. Was an 'a priori' design provided? The research question and inclusion criteria should be established before the conduct of the review. Note: Need to refer to a protocol, ethics approval, or pre-determined/a priori published research objectives to score a “yes.”
""[No]"" No protocol, ethics approval, or pre-determined objectives referenced.

A2. Was there duplicate study selection and data extraction? There should be at least two independent data extractors and a consensus procedure for disagreements should be in place. Note: 2 people do study selection, 2 people do data extraction, consensus process or one person checks the other’s work.  
""[NA]"" The review did not mention duplicate study selection or data extraction.

A3. Was a comprehensive literature search performed? At least two electronic sources should be searched. The report must include years and databases used (e.g., Central, EMBASE, and MEDLINE). Key words and/or MESH terms must be stated and where feasible the search strategy should be provided. All searches should be supplemented by consulting current contents, reviews, textbooks, specialized registers, or experts in the particular field of study, and by reviewing the references in the studies found. Note: If at least 2 sources + one supplementary strategy used, select “yes” (Cochrane register/Central counts as 2 sources; a grey literature search counts as supplementary).
""[Yes]"" The authors searched Medline, Embase, Web of Science, and manually searched journals. This meets the criteria for at least 2 electronic sources plus supplementary searching.

A4. Was the status of publication (i.e. grey literature) used as an inclusion criterion? The authors should state that they searched for reports regardless of their publication type. The authors should state whether or not they excluded any reports (from the systematic review), based on their publication status, language etc. Note: If review indicates that there was a search for “grey literature” or “unpublished literature,” indicate “yes.” SIGLE database, dissertations, conference proceedings, and trial registries are all considered grey for this purpose. If searching a source that contains both grey and non-grey, must specify that they were searching for grey/unpublished lit. 
""[No]"" The review did not mention searching for or including grey literature.

A5. Was a list of studies (included and excluded) provided? A list of included and excluded studies should be provided. Note: Acceptable if the excluded studies are referenced. If there is an electronic link to the list but the link is dead, select “no.”
""[No]"" No list of included/excluded studies was provided. 

A6. Were the characteristics of the included studies provided? In an aggregated form such as a table, data from the original studies should be provided on the participants, interventions and outcomes. The ranges of characteristics in all the studies analyzed e.g., age, race, sex, relevant socioeconomic data, disease status, duration, severity, or other diseases should be reported. Note: Acceptable if not in table format as long as they are described as above.
""[Yes]"" Relevant characteristics of the included studies were provided in Tables 1 and 2.

A7. Was the scientific quality of the included studies assessed and documented? 'A priori' methods of assessment should be provided (e.g., for effectiveness studies if the author(s) chose to include only randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled studies, or allocation concealment as inclusion criteria); for other types of studies alternative items will be relevant. Note: Can include use of a quality scoring tool or checklist, e.g., Jadad scale, risk of bias, sensitivity analysis, etc., or a description of quality items, with some kind of result for EACH study (“low” or “high” is fine, as long as it is clear which studies scored “low” and which scored “high”; a summary score/range for all studies is not acceptable).
""[No]"" The quality of included studies was not assessed.

A8. Was the scientific quality of the included studies used appropriately in formulating conclusions? The results of the methodological rigor and scientific quality should be considered in the analysis and the conclusions of the review, and explicitly stated in formulating recommendations. Note: Might say something such as “the results should be interpreted with caution due to poor quality of included studies.” Cannot score “yes” for this question if scored “no” for question A7.
""[No]"" Study quality was not assessed or considered in formulating conclusions.

A9. Were the methods used to combine the findings of studies appropriate? For the pooled results, a test should be done to ensure the studies were combinable, to assess their homogeneity (i.e., Chi-squared test for homogeneity, I2 ). If heterogeneity exists a random effects model should be used and/or the clinical appropriateness of combining should be taken into consideration (i.e., is it sensible to combine?). Note: Indicate “yes” if they mention or describe heterogeneity, i.e., if they explain that they cannot pool because of heterogeneity/variability between interventions.
""[NA]"" The review did not conduct a quantitative synthesis or meta-analysis.

A10. Was the likelihood of publication bias assessed? An assessment of publication bias should include a combination of graphical aids (e.g., funnel plot, other available tests) and/or statistical tests (e.g., Egger regression test, Hedges-Olken). Note: If no test values or funnel plot included, score “no”. Score “yes” if mentions that publication bias could not be assessed because there were fewer than 10 included studies.  
""[NA]"" Publication bias was not assessed, likely because no meta-analysis was conducted. 

A11. Was the conflict of interest included? Potential sources of support should be clearly acknowledged in both the systematic review and the included studies. Note: To get a “yes,” must indicate source of funding or support for the systematic review AND for each of the included studies.
""[No]"" No conflicts of interest were reported for the review or the included studies.

P1. Identify the report as a systematic review, meta-analysis, or both.
""[Yes]"" The report is identified as a systematic review in the title.

Quotes:
""The spectrum of esophageal atresia (EA) and tracheoesopha-geal fistula (TEF) include an isolated EA, EA with a proximal and/or distal TEF and the “H” or “N” type fistula. Since the initial description of the open surgical repair1 and subsequent thoracoscopic approaches2,3 the outcomes have been very encouraging. Anastomotic leaks, esophageal strictures, gas-troesophageal reflux, and tracheomalacia are complications pediatric surgeons are familiar with. The incidence of a fistula recurrence range from 1.9 to 11% after open and thoraco-scopic repairs.2,4–8 The diagnosis of these recurrent trache-
oesophageal fistulas (RTEF) can often be elusive to the unsuspecting physician and the ideal approach to their management is still in debate. Proponents of an endoscopic approach to this problem frequently state that the morbidity, mortality, and second recurrence rate are too high with an open approach and majority directly or indirectly reference the only literature review of open surgery (OS) from 1970 by Kafrouni et al.7 Here, we reviewed the published treatment options, and their outcomes, for managing RTEF. This review will aid pediatric surgeons in making management decisions when faced with a recurrent TEF.""

Quotes:
""A Medline, Embase, and web of science searches were performed using the keywords “recurrent tracheoesophageal fistula.” All English language articles published by August 2013, irrespective of design, describing the management of, and outcome after, RTEF in children under 18 years were reviewed.

In summary, the review adequately addressed some PRISMA and AMSTAR items such as providing rationale (P3), specifying eligibility criteria (P6), searching multiple databases (A3), and providing study characteristics (P18, A6). However, several key items were not addressed including providing a protocol, search strategy, study selection process, data extraction process, study quality assessment, evaluation of publication bias, limitations, and conflicts of interest. Additional details should be reported to improve the transparency and reliability of the review methodology.
"," Here are the AMSTAR and PRISMA assessments for the given systematic review:

A1. Was an 'a priori' design provided? The research question and inclusion criteria should be established before the conduct of the review. Note: Need to refer to a protocol, ethics approval, or pre-determined/a priori published research objectives to score a “yes.”
""[No]"" No protocol, ethics approval, or pre-determined objectives referenced.

A2. Was there duplicate study selection and data extraction? There should be at least two independent data extractors and a consensus procedure for disagreements should be in place. Note: 2 people do study selection, 2 people do data extraction, consensus process or one person checks the other’s work.  
""[NA]"" The review did not mention duplicate study selection or data extraction.

A3. Was a comprehensive literature search performed? At least two electronic sources should be searched. The report must include years and databases used (e.g., Central, EMBASE, and MEDLINE). Key words and/or MESH terms must be stated and where feasible the search strategy should be provided. All searches should be supplemented by consulting current contents, reviews, textbooks, specialized registers, or experts in the particular field of study, and by reviewing the references in the studies found. Note: If at least 2 sources + one supplementary strategy used, select “yes” (Cochrane register/Central counts as 2 sources; a grey literature search counts as supplementary).
""[Yes]"" The authors searched Medline, Embase, Web of Science, and manually searched journals. This meets the criteria for at least 2 electronic sources plus supplementary searching.

A4. Was the status of publication (i.e. grey literature) used as an inclusion criterion? The authors should state that they searched for reports regardless of their publication type. The authors should state whether or not they excluded any reports (from the systematic review), based on their publication status, language etc. Note: If review indicates that there was a search for “grey literature” or “unpublished literature,” indicate “yes.” SIGLE database, dissertations, conference proceedings, and trial registries are all considered grey for this purpose. If searching a source that contains both grey and non-grey, must specify that they were searching for grey/unpublished lit. 
""[No]"" The review did not mention searching for or including grey literature.

A5. Was a list of studies (included and excluded) provided? A list of included and excluded studies should be provided. Note: Acceptable if the excluded studies are referenced. If there is an electronic link to the list but the link is dead, select “no.”
""[No]"" No list of included/excluded studies was provided. 

A6. Were the characteristics of the included studies provided? In an aggregated form such as a table, data from the original studies should be provided on the participants, interventions and outcomes. The ranges of characteristics in all the studies analyzed e.g., age, race, sex, relevant socioeconomic data, disease status, duration, severity, or other diseases should be reported. Note: Acceptable if not in table format as long as they are described as above.
""[Yes]"" Relevant characteristics of the included studies were provided in Tables 1 and 2.

A7. Was the scientific quality of the included studies assessed and documented? 'A priori' methods of assessment should be provided (e.g., for effectiveness studies if the author(s) chose to include only randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled studies, or allocation concealment as inclusion criteria); for other types of studies alternative items will be relevant. Note: Can include use of a quality scoring tool or checklist, e.g., Jadad scale, risk of bias, sensitivity analysis, etc., or a description of quality items, with some kind of result for EACH study (“low” or “high” is fine, as long as it is clear which studies scored “low” and which scored “high”; a summary score/range for all studies is not acceptable).
""[No]"" The quality of included studies was not assessed.

A8. Was the scientific quality of the included studies used appropriately in formulating conclusions? The results of the methodological rigor and scientific quality should be considered in the analysis and the conclusions of the review, and explicitly stated in formulating recommendations. Note: Might say something such as “the results should be interpreted with caution due to poor quality of included studies.” Cannot score “yes” for this question if scored “no” for question A7.
""[No]"" Study quality was not assessed or considered in formulating conclusions.

A9. Were the methods used to combine the findings of studies appropriate? For the pooled results, a test should be done to ensure the studies were combinable, to assess their homogeneity (i.e., Chi-squared test for homogeneity, I2 ). If heterogeneity exists a random effects model should be used and/or the clinical appropriateness of combining should be taken into consideration (i.e., is it sensible to combine?). Note: Indicate “yes” if they mention or describe heterogeneity, i.e., if they explain that they cannot pool because of heterogeneity/variability between interventions.
""[NA]"" The review did not conduct a quantitative synthesis or meta-analysis.

A10. Was the likelihood of publication bias assessed? An assessment of publication bias should include a combination of graphical aids (e.g., funnel plot, other available tests) and/or statistical tests (e.g., Egger regression test, Hedges-Olken). Note: If no test values or funnel plot included, score “no”. Score “yes” if mentions that publication bias could not be assessed because there were fewer than 10 included studies.  
""[NA]"" Publication bias was not assessed, likely because no meta-analysis was conducted. 

A11. Was the conflict of interest included? Potential sources of support should be clearly acknowledged in both the systematic review and the included studies. Note: To get a “yes,” must indicate source of funding or support for the systematic review AND for each of the included studies.
""[No]"" No conflicts of interest were reported for the review or the included studies.

Quotes:
""The spectrum of esophageal atresia (EA) and tracheoesopha-geal fistula (TEF) include an isolated EA, EA with a proximal and/or distal TEF and the “H” or “N” type fistula. Since the initial description of the open surgical repair1 and subsequent thoracoscopic approaches2,3 the outcomes have been very encouraging. Anastomotic leaks, esophageal strictures, gas-troesophageal reflux, and tracheomalacia are complications pediatric surgeons are familiar with. The incidence of a fistula recurrence range from 1.9 to 11% after open and thoraco-scopic repairs.2,4–8 The diagnosis of these recurrent trache-
oesophageal fistulas (RTEF) can often be elusive to the unsuspecting physician and the ideal approach to their management is still in debate. Proponents of an endoscopic approach to this problem frequently state that the morbidity, mortality, and second recurrence rate are too high with an open approach and majority directly or indirectly reference the only literature review of open surgery (OS) from 1970 by Kafrouni et al.7 Here, we reviewed the published treatment options, and their outcomes, for managing RTEF.

A1. Was an 'a priori' design provided? The research question and inclusion criteria should be established before the conduct of the review.
- ""This review was conducted to evaluate the clinical and cost-effectiveness of this approach for a variety of different surgical indications in pediatric populations.""
- Clearly stated objective and inclusion criteria before conducting the review.
[Yes]

A2. Was there duplicate study selection and data extraction? There should be at least two independent data extractors and a consensus procedure for disagreements should be in place.  
- No mention of duplicate study selection or data extraction.
[No]

A3. Was a comprehensive literature search performed? At least two electronic sources should be searched. The report must include years and databases used (e.g., Central, EMBASE, and MEDLINE). Key words and/or MESH terms must be stated and where feasible the search strategy should be provided. All searches should be supplemented by consulting current contents, reviews, textbooks, specialized registers, or experts in the particular field of study, and by reviewing the references in the studies found.
- Searched multiple electronic databases, along with supplementary search methods. Provided keywords used.
[Yes]

A4. Was the status of publication (i.e. grey literature) used as an inclusion criterion? The authors should state that they searched for reports regardless of their publication type. The authors should state whether or not they excluded any reports (from the systematic review), based on their publication status, language etc. 
- No mention of searching for grey literature.
[No] 

A5. Was a list of studies (included and excluded) provided? A list of included and excluded studies should be provided.
- Included studies summarized in Table 1. No list of excluded studies.
[No]

A6. Were the characteristics of the included studies provided? In an aggregated form such as a table, data from the original studies should be provided on the participants, interventions and outcomes. The ranges of characteristics in all the studies analyzed e.g., age, race, sex, relevant socioeconomic data, disease status, duration, severity, or other diseases should be reported.
- Table 1 provides summary of study design and quality. Outcomes summarized in text and figures. Limited details on patient characteristics. 
[No]

A7. Was the scientific quality of the included studies assessed and documented? 'A priori' methods of assessment should be provided (e.g., for effectiveness studies if the author(s) chose to include only randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled studies, or allocation concealment as inclusion criteria); for other types of studies alternative items will be relevant.
- Assessed quality using established criteria, summarized in Table 1.
[Yes]

A8. Was the scientific quality of the included studies used appropriately in formulating conclusions? The results of the methodological rigor and scientific quality should be considered in the analysis and the conclusions of the review, and explicitly stated in formulating recommendations.
- Does not explicitly discuss limitations of included study quality when interpreting results.
[No]

A9. Were the methods used to combine the findings of studies appropriate? For the pooled results, a test should be done to ensure the studies were combinable, to assess their homogeneity (i.e., Chi-squared test for homogeneity, I2). If heterogeneity exists a random effects model should be used and/or the clinical appropriateness of combining should be taken into consideration (i.e., is it sensible to combine?).
- Used appropriate statistical methods for meta-analysis (mean differences, tests for heterogeneity).
[Yes]

A10. Was the likelihood of publication bias assessed? An assessment of publication bias should include a combination of graphical aids (e.g., funnel plot, other available tests) and/or statistical tests (e.g., Egger regression test, Hedges-Olken).
- No assessment of publication bias.
[No]

A11. Was the conflict of interest included? Potential sources of support should be clearly acknowledged in both the systematic review and the included studies.
- No statement on conflict of interest.
[No]

In summary, this systematic review adequately addressed some but not all key methodological criteria based on the AMSTAR quality assessment tool. Additional details on study selection methods, grey literature searching, included/excluded studies, and consideration of study limitations when interpreting results would improve confidence in the review findings.

A1. Was an 'a priori' design provided? 
[No] No mention of a protocol.

A2. Was there duplicate study selection and data extraction?
[No] Only states ""Two authors independently screened the abstracts and extraction was verified by a second author (JAB and RKS)."" No mention of duplicate data extraction.

A3. Was a comprehensive literature search performed? 
[Yes] Searched EMBASE, Medline, Cochrane Library, reference lists, and hand searched Obesity Surgery. Search terms and inclusion/exclusion criteria provided. 

A4. Was the status of publication (i.e. grey literature) used as an inclusion criterion?
[No] No mention of including or excluding based on publication status.

A5. Was a list of studies (included and excluded) provided?
[Yes] Figure 1 shows flow of included and excluded studies. References list included studies.

A6. Were the characteristics of the included studies provided?
[Yes] Table 2 provides characteristics of included studies.  

A7. Was the scientific quality of the included studies assessed and documented?
[No] No quality assessment of included studies mentioned.

A8. Was the scientific quality of the included studies used appropriately in formulating conclusions?
[NA] No quality assessment performed.

A9. Were the methods used to combine the findings of studies appropriate?

In summary, the review adequately addressed most AMSTAR and PRISMA items, with some limitations in fully reporting the search strategy, not assessing publication bias for all outcomes, and not explicitly reporting funding/conflicts of interest. The overall quality appears moderately good. Key results indicate no significant differences in primary outcomes of success rates, reoperation rates, complications between RAP, LP and OP, but some benefits of RAP for length of stay and analgesia requirements. The quality of evidence is limited by lack of RCTs and prospective studies. More high quality comparative research is needed.

# AMSTAR

A1. Was an 'a priori' design provided? The research question and inclusion criteria should be established before the conduct of the review. Note: Need to refer to a protocol, ethics approval, or pre-determined/a priori published research objectives to score a “yes.”

Quotes: None.

Explanation: The study did not mention an a priori design or protocol.

Response: [No]

A2. Was there duplicate study selection and data extraction? There should be at least two independent data extractors and a consensus procedure for disagreements should be in place. Note: 2 people do study selection, 2 people do data extraction, consensus process or one person checks the other’s work.  

Quotes: None.

Explanation: The study did not mention duplicate study selection or data extraction.

Response: [No] 

A3. Was a comprehensive literature search performed? At least two electronic sources should be searched. The report must include years and databases used (e.g., Central, EMBASE, and MEDLINE). Key words and/or MESH terms must be stated and where feasible the search strategy should be provided. All searches should be supplemented by consulting current contents, reviews, textbooks, specialized registers, or experts in the particular field of study, and by reviewing the references in the studies found. Note: If at least 2 sources + one supplementary strategy used, select “yes” (Cochrane register/Central counts as 2 sources; a grey literature search counts as supplementary).

Quotes: ""Clinical studies published in the English literature were identified by a Medline literature search using PubMed (www.pubmed.com). The Web site was last accessed on January 2, 2013. The search limits “humans,” “child: 0–18 years,” “english,” “randomized-controlled trials,” “comparative study,” “systematic reviews,” and “meta-analysis” were applied.""

Explanation: Only one electronic database (PubMed) was searched. 

Response: [No]

A4. Was the status of publication (i.e. grey literature) used as an inclusion criterion? The authors should state that they searched for reports regardless of their publication type. The authors should state whether or not they excluded any reports (from the systematic review), based on their publication status, language etc. Note: If review indicates that there was a search for “grey literature” or “unpublished literature,” indicate “yes.” SIGLE database, dissertations, conference proceedings, and trial registries are all considered grey for this purpose. If searching a source that contains both grey and non-grey, must specify that they were searching for grey/unpublished lit.

Quotes: None.

Explanation: Searching for grey literature was not mentioned.

Response: [No]

A5. Was a list of studies (included and excluded) provided? A list of included and excluded studies should be provided. Note: Acceptable if the excluded studies are referenced. If there is an electronic link to the list but the link is dead, select “no.”

Quotes: None. 

Explanation: A list of included and excluded studies was not provided.

Response: [No]

A6. Were the characteristics of the included studies provided? In an aggregated form such as a table, data from the original studies should be provided on the participants, interventions and outcomes. The ranges of characteristics in all the studies analyzed e.g., age, race, sex, relevant socioeconomic data, disease status, duration, severity, or other diseases should be reported. Note: Acceptable if not in table format as long as they are described as above. Paul ""Follow-up poorly reported in general""

Quotes: ""The main results of the studies with regard to advantages and disadvantages of laparoscopic compared with open surgery are summarized in alphabetical order."" 

Explanation: The characteristics of the included studies were summarized in the results section.

Response: [Yes]

A7. Was the scientific quality of the included studies assessed and documented? 'A priori' methods of assessment should be provided (e.g., for effectiveness studies if the author(s) chose to include only randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled studies, or allocation concealment as inclusion criteria); for other types of studies alternative items will be relevant. Note: Can include use of a quality scoring tool or checklist, e.g., Jadad scale, risk of bias, sensitivity analysis, etc., or a description of quality items, with some kind of result for EACH study (“low” or “high” is fine, as long as it is clear which studies scored “low” and which scored “high”; a summary score/range for all studies is not acceptable).

Quotes: None.

Explanation: The scientific quality of included studies was not assessed.

Response: [No]

A8. Was the scientific quality of the included studies used appropriately in formulating conclusions? The results of the methodological rigor and scientific quality should be considered in the analysis and the conclusions of the review, and explicitly stated in formulating recommendations. Note: Might say something such as “the results should be interpreted with caution due to poor quality of included studies.” Cannot score “yes” for this question if scored “no” for question A7.

Quotes: None. 

Explanation: The scientific quality of included studies was not used in formulating conclusions since it was not assessed.

Response: [No]

A9. Were the methods used to combine the findings of studies appropriate? For the pooled results, a test should be done to ensure the studies were combinable, to assess their homogeneity (i.e., Chi-squared test for homogeneity, I2). If heterogeneity exists a random effects model should be used and/or the clinical appropriateness of combining should be taken into consideration (i.e., is it sensible to combine?). Note: Indicate “yes” if they mention or describe heterogeneity, i.e., if they explain that they cannot pool because of heterogeneity/variability between interventions.

Quotes: None.

Explanation: The findings of studies were not combined quantitatively. 

Response: [NA]

A10. Was the likelihood of publication bias assessed? An assessment of publication bias should include a combination of graphical aids (e.g., funnel plot, other available tests) and/or statistical tests (e.g., Egger regression test, Hedges-Olken). Note: If no test values or funnel plot included, score “no”. Score “yes” if mentions that publication bias could not be assessed because there were fewer than 10 included studies.

Quotes: None.

Explanation: Publication bias was not assessed.

Response: [No] 

A11. Was the conflict of interest included? Potential sources of support should be clearly acknowledged in both the systematic review and the included studies. Note: To get a “yes,” must indicate source of funding or support for the systematic review AND for each of the included studies.

Quotes: ""None of the authors has competing financial interests to disclose.""

Explanation: Conflict of interest was only mentioned for the authors of the systematic review, but not for the included studies. 

Response: [No]

In summary, the AMSTAR assessment yielded 8 'No', 2 'NA', and 1 'Yes' responses. The PRISMA assessment yielded 10 'No', 7 'NA', and 3 'Yes' responses. This indicates poor reporting quality overall, with particular deficiencies in methods and risk of bias assessment. The level of evidence appears to be no higher than retrospective comparative studies (Level 3) based on the types of included studies.

The results of the methodological rigor and scientific quality should be considered in the analysis and the conclusions of the review, and explicitly stated in formulating recommendations. Note: Might say something such as “the results should be interpreted with caution due to poor quality of included studies.” Cannot score “yes” for this question if scored “no” for question A7.

Quotes: None. 

Explanation: The scientific quality of included studies was not used in formulating conclusions since it was not assessed.

Response: [No]

A9. Were the methods used to combine the findings of studies appropriate? For the pooled results, a test should be done to ensure the studies were combinable, to assess their homogeneity (i.e., Chi-squared test for homogeneity, I2). If heterogeneity exists a random effects model should be used and/or the clinical appropriateness of combining should be taken into consideration (i.e., is it sensible to combine?). Note: Indicate “yes” if they mention or describe heterogeneity, i.e., if they explain that they cannot pool because of heterogeneity/variability between interventions.

Quotes: None.

Explanation: The findings of studies were not combined quantitatively. 

Response: [NA]

A10. Was the likelihood of publication bias assessed? An assessment of publication bias should include a combination of graphical aids (e.g., funnel plot, other available tests) and/or statistical tests (e.g., Egger regression test, Hedges-Olken). Note: If no test values or funnel plot included, score “no”. Score “yes” if mentions that publication bias could not be assessed because there were fewer than 10 included studies.

Quotes: None.

Explanation: Publication bias was not assessed.

Response: [No] 

A11. Was the conflict of interest included? Potential sources of support should be clearly acknowledged in both the systematic review and the included studies. Note: To get a “yes,” must indicate source of funding or support for the systematic review AND for each of the included studies.

Quotes: ""None of the authors has competing financial interests to disclose.""

Explanation: Conflict of interest was only mentioned for the authors of the systematic review, but not for the included studies. 

Response: [No]

In summary, the AMSTAR assessment yielded 8 'No', 2 'NA', and 1 'Yes' responses. The PRISMA assessment yielded 10 'No', 7 'NA', and 3 'Yes' responses. This indicates poor reporting quality overall, with particular deficiencies in methods and risk of bias assessment. The level of evidence appears to be no higher than retrospective comparative studies (Level 3) based on the types of included studies.
