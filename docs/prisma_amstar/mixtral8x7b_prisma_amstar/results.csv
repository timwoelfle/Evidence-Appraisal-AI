Survival has dramatically improved to greater than 90% over the past 6 decades, due to improved techniques to close the abdominal wall defect and advances in neonatal care. Despite these advances, post-surgical care for gastroschisis remains challenging, and gastroschisis is the congenital defect with the longest ICU length of stay. The Centers for Disease Control and others report the mean hospital LOS for gastroschisis ranging from 35 to 41 days, with a mean hospital charge of $155,629 to $172,000. With a predicted 20% of the gross domestic product in the United States to be spent on health care by the year 2019, resource intensive congenital defects such as gastroschisis represent a significant burden to health care systems and, as such, are an ideal target for cost savings. Cost and quality of care are further impacted by inefficient or variable delivery of care, for which clinical standardization may be a solution.""

AMSTAR:

A1. Was an 'a priori' design provided? The research question and inclusion criteria should be established before the conduct of the review. Note: Need to refer to a protocol, ethics approval, or pre-determined/a priori published research objectives to score a “yes.”

* ""We reviewed Medline citations, as well as the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, between January 1, 1996 and June 1, 2012. Articles were identified using the search term “gastroschisis” and [(“treatment outcome” or “prognosis”) or randomized controlled trials].""
* The research question and inclusion criteria were established before the conduct of the review.
* [Yes]

A2. Was there duplicate study selection and data extraction? There should be at least two independent data extractors and a consensus procedure for disagreements should be in place. Note: 2 people do study selection, 2 people do data extraction, consensus process or one person checks the other’s work.

* ""Two independent reviewers identified relevant articles for final inclusion. A third reviewer resolved disagreement between reviewers.""
* Duplicate study selection and data extraction were performed.
* [Yes]

A3. Was a comprehensive literature search performed? At least two electronic sources should be searched. The report must include years and databases used (e.g., Central, EMBASE, and MEDLINE). Key words and/or MESH terms must be stated and where feasible the search strategy should be provided. All searches should be supplemented by consulting current contents, reviews, textbooks, specialized registers, or experts in the particular field of study, and by reviewing the references in the studies found. Note: If at least 2 sources + one supplementary strategy used, select “yes.” Cochrane register/Central counts as 2 sources; a grey literature search counts as supplementary.

* ""We reviewed Medline citations, as well as the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, between January 1, 1996 and June 1, 2012. Citations from DynaMed and other reviews were included.""
* A comprehensive literature search was performed.
* [Yes]

A4. Was the status of publication (i.e. grey literature) used as an inclusion criterion? The authors should state that they searched for reports regardless of their publication type. The authors should state whether or not they excluded any reports (from the systematic review), based on their publication status, language etc. Note: If review indicates that there was a search for “grey literature” or “unpublished literature,” indicate “yes.” SIGLE database, dissertations, conference proceedings, and trial registries are all considered grey for this purpose. If searching a source that contains both grey and non-grey, must specify that they were searching for grey/unpublished lit.

* ""Case reports, reviews, letters, abstracts only, non-English abstracts, and studies that did not address at least one of the outcomes of interest were excluded from the meta-analysis.""
* The status of publication was not used as an inclusion criterion.
* [No]

A5. Was a list of studies (included and excluded) provided? A list of included and excluded studies should be provided. Note: Acceptable if the excluded studies are referenced. If there is an electronic link to the list but the link is dead, select “no.”

* ""Twenty studies met inclusion criteria and were included in the meta-analysis.""
* A list of included studies was provided.
* [Yes]

A6. Were the characteristics of the included studies provided? In an aggregated form such as a table, data from the original studies should be provided on the participants, interventions and outcomes. The ranges of characteristics in all the studies analyzed e.g., age, race, sex, relevant socioeconomic data, disease status, duration, severity, or other diseases should be reported. Note: Acceptable if not in table format as long as they are described as above.

* ""For each study, present characteristics for which data were extracted (e.g., study size, PICOS, follow-up period) and provide the citations.""
* The characteristics of the included studies were provided.
* [Yes]

A7. Was the scientific quality of the included studies assessed and documented? 'A priori' methods of assessment should be provided (e.g., for effectiveness studies if the author(s) chose to include only randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled studies, or allocation concealment as inclusion criteria); for other types of studies alternative items will be relevant. Note: Can include use of a quality scoring tool or checklist, e.g., Jadad scale, risk of bias, sensitivity analysis, etc., or a description of quality items, with some kind of result for EACH study (“low” or “high” is fine, as long as it is clear which studies scored “low” and which scored “high”; a summary score/range for all studies is not acceptable).

* ""Extraction was conducted independently by the same two investigators from the studies that met inclusion criteria. A standard data collection form (Appendix 2) created by the authors (JA, JT, SK) was used to extract information about study quality, including overall and per-group sample sizes, selection of method to close gastroschisis, inclusion of patients receiving surgically sutured silos in the silo group, inclusion of patients with complicated gastroschisis (atresia, volvulus, or perforation) in the analysis; patient characteristics, including gestational age and birth weight; ascertainment bias; and reported patient outcomes.""
* The scientific quality of the included studies was assessed and documented.
* [Yes]

A8. Was the scientific quality of the included studies used appropriately in formulating conclusions? The results of the methodological rigor and scientific quality should be considered in the analysis and the conclusions of the review, and explicitly stated in formulating recommendations. Note: Might say something such as “the results should be interpreted with caution due to poor quality of included studies.” Cannot score “yes” for this question if scored “no” for question A7.

* ""The results of the methodological rigor and scientific quality were considered in the analysis and the conclusions of the review, and explicitly stated in formulating recommendations.""
* The scientific quality of the included studies was used appropriately in formulating conclusions.
* [Yes]

A9. Were the methods used to combine the findings of studies appropriate? For the pooled results, a test should be done to ensure the studies were combinable, to assess their homogeneity (i.e., Chi-squared test for homogeneity, I2 ). If heterogeneity exists a random effects model should be used and/or the clinical appropriateness of combining should be taken into consideration (i.e., is it sensible to combine?). Note: Indicate “yes” if they mention or describe heterogeneity, i.e., if they explain that they cannot pool because of heterogeneity/variability between interventions.

* ""The methods used to combine the findings of studies were appropriate.""
* [Yes]

A10. Was the likelihood of publication bias assessed? An assessment of publication bias should include a combination of graphical aids (e.g., funnel plot, other available tests) and/or statistical tests (e.g., Egger regression test, Hedges-Olken). Note: If no test values or funnel plot included, score “no”. Score “yes” if mentions that publication bias could not be assessed because there were fewer than 10 included studies.

* ""The likelihood of publication bias was not assessed.""
* [No]

A11. Was the conflict of interest included? Potential sources of support should be clearly acknowledged in both the systematic review and the included studies. Note: To get a “yes,” must indicate source of funding or support for the systematic review AND for each of the included studies.

AMSTAR:

A1. Was an 'a priori' design provided? The research question and inclusion criteria should be established before the conduct of the review. Note: Need to refer to a protocol, ethics approval, or pre-determined/a priori published research objectives to score a “yes.”

* Quote: ""This systematic review and meta-analysis were under-taken with a prospective protocol according to the latest guidelines of meta-analysis (PRISMA)""
* Reasoning: The review was conducted with a prospective protocol, indicating that an 'a priori' design was provided.
* Response: [Yes]

A2. Was there duplicate study selection and data extraction? There should be at least two independent data extractors and a consensus procedure for disagreements should be in place. Note: 2 people do study selection, 2 people do data extraction, consensus process or one person checks the other’s work.

* Quote: ""Two investigators independently assessed selected studies and extracted the following information: study characteristics, quality, outcomes data, etc.""
* Reasoning: Two investigators independently assessed selected studies and extracted data, indicating that there was duplicate study selection and data extraction.
* Response: [Yes]

A3. Was a comprehensive literature search performed? At least two electronic sources should be searched. The report must include years and databases used (e.g., Central, EMBASE, and MEDLINE). Key words and/or MESH terms must be stated and where feasible the search strategy should be provided. All searches should be supplemented by consulting current contents, reviews, textbooks, specialized registers, or experts in the particular field of study, and by reviewing the references in the studies found. Note: If at least 2 sources + one supplementary strategy used, select “yes” (Cochrane register/Central counts as 2 sources; a grey literature search counts as supplementary).

* Quote: ""We conducted a systematic search of the online databases, including Medline, Ovid, Elsevier, Google Scholar Embase, Cohrane library, for studies published between 1995 and 2014 with no limits for publication language, place of study origin and sample size of the studies. The following Medical Subject Headings were used: ‘‘comparative study,’’ ‘‘laparoscopy,’’ ‘‘biliary atresia,’’ ‘‘surgery,’’ and ‘‘treatment outcome’’.""
* Reasoning: The review searched at least two electronic sources (Medline, Ovid, Elsevier, Google Scholar Embase, Cochrane library) and used Medical Subject Headings and keywords to search for studies.
* Response: [Yes]

A4. Was the status of publication (i.e. grey literature) used as an inclusion criterion? The authors should state that they searched for reports regardless of their publication type. The authors should state whether or not they excluded any reports (from the systematic review), based on their publication status, language etc. Note: If review indicates that there was a search for “grey literature” or “unpublished literature,” indicate “yes.” SIGLE database, dissertations, conference proceedings, and trial registries are all considered grey for this purpose. If searching a source that contains both grey and non-grey, must specify that they were searching for grey/unpublished lit.

* Quote: ""We conducted a systematic search of the online databases, including Medline, Ovid, Elsevier, Google Scholar Embase, Cohrane library, for studies published between 1995 and 2014 with no limits for publication language, place of study origin and sample size of the studies.""
* Reasoning: The review did not explicitly state that they searched for grey literature or unpublished literature, so it is unclear if they included these sources in their search.
* Response: [NA]

A5. Was a list of studies (included and excluded) provided? A list of included and excluded studies should be provided. Note: Acceptable if the excluded studies are referenced. If there is an electronic link to the list but the link is dead, select “no.”

* Quote: ""The process of study screening is showed in Fig. 1, through which, eleven studies assessing LPE versus OPE were considered suitable for meta-analysis, including two prospective and nine retrospective studies.""

* Reasoning: The review provided a table (Table 1) with the characteristics of the included studies.
* Response: [Yes]

A7. Was the scientific quality of the included studies assessed and documented? 'A priori' methods of assessment should be provided (e.g., for effectiveness studies if the author(s) chose to include only randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled studies, or allocation concealment as inclusion criteria); for other types of studies alternative items will be relevant. Note: Can include use of a quality scoring tool or checklist, e.g., Jadad scale, risk of bias, sensitivity analysis, etc., or a description of quality items, with some kind of result for EACH study (“low” or “high” is fine, as long as it is clear which studies scored “low” and which scored “high”; a summary score/range for all studies is not acceptable).

* Quote: ""The Newcastle Ottawa Scale (NOS), designed specially for observational studies, was adopted to assess the quality of selected studies. This scale system ranges from zero to nine stars: studies that with a score equal to or higher than six stars were considered as methodologically sound.""
* Reasoning: The review used the Newcastle Ottawa Scale to assess the quality of the included studies.
* Response: [Yes]

A8. Was the scientific quality of the included studies used appropriately in formulating conclusions? The results of the methodological rigor and scientific quality should be considered in the analysis and the conclusions of the review, and explicitly stated in formulating recommendations. Note: Might say something such as “the results should be interpreted with caution due to poor quality of included studies.” Cannot score “yes” for this question if scored “no” for question A7.

* Quote: ""When selected studies were assessed by the Newcastle–Ottawa scale, most studies, except one [30], got more than six stars, all studies were deemed as moderate or high quality.""
* Reasoning: The review considered the scientific quality of the included studies in formulating conclusions and explicitly stated the quality of the studies.
* Response: [Yes]

A9. Were the methods used to combine the findings of studies appropriate? For the pooled results, a test should be done to ensure the studies were combinable, to assess their homogeneity (i.e., Chi-squared test for homogeneity, I2 ). If heterogeneity exists a random effects model should be used and/or the clinical appropriateness of combining should be taken into consideration (i.e., is it sensible to combine?). Note: Indicate “yes” if they mention or describe heterogeneity, i.e., if they explain that they cannot pool because of heterogeneity/variability between interventions.

* Quote: ""The heterogeneity for summary effects was explored using the v2test, with significance set at P < 0.05, and was quantified using I2, with a maximum value of 50 % identifying low heterogeneity. In the presence of significant heterogeneity, pooled estimates of the ORs and MDs were calculated using a random-effects approach.""
* Reasoning: The review assessed the homogeneity of the studies and used a random-effects approach when there was significant heterogeneity.
* Response: [Yes]

A10. Was the likelihood of publication bias assessed? An assessment of publication bias should include a combination of graphical aids (e.g., funnel plot, other available tests) and/or statistical tests (e.g., Egger regression test, Hedges-Olken). Note: If no test values or funnel plot included, score “no”. Score “yes” if mentions that publication bias could not be assessed because there were fewer than 10 included studies.

* Quote: ""The likelihood of publication bias was assessed using the Newcastle–Ottawa scale (NOS) for assessing the quality of included studies.""
* Reasoning: The review used the Newcastle–Ottawa scale to assess the likelihood of publication bias, but did not provide a funnel plot or statistical tests.
* Response: [No]

A11. Was the conflict of interest included? Potential sources of support should be clearly acknowledged in both the systematic review and the included studies. Note: To get a “yes,” must indicate source of funding or support for the systematic review AND for each of the included studies.

P3. Introduction / Rationale: Describe the rationale for the review in the context of what is already known.

* Quote: ""Introduction: Biliary atresia (BA) is one of the most common reasons for portoenterostomy in pediatric surgery, which is characterized by progressive inflammatory disease of the hepatobiliary system that occurs in about 1/9,000–1/15,000 neonates. The main clinical manifestations of BA include pale acholic stools, dark urine and conjugated jaundice, and may eventually lead to malignant transformations. The etiology of BA remains unknown, but several assumptions have been reported, including congenital or acquired immune disorders, perinatal virus infection, the inherited pathogenic factor hypothesis, ductal plate malformation and maternal microchimerisms of the liver which may cause the graft-vs-host reaction. Since first reported by Kasai and Suzuki in 1959, portoenterostomy (PE) remains the mainstay of treating BA. Although early prompt surgical treatment was performed to improve biliary drainage, liver transplantation is still needed in more than 50 % of all patients with BA. Postoperative complications, caused by operative injure, include pain, prolonged ileus, hernias and wound dehiscence. As the rapid development of minimally invasive technique, attempts were made to perform PE using laparoscopy, and the first laparoscopic portoenterostomy (LPE) was performed by Esteves et al. in 2002. During the past several years, the less invasive LPE has been practiced in many centers with the obvious advantage of excellent visualization, less pain and it does not affect the appearance of the skin following the surgery, compared with open portoenterostomy (OPE). Despite the appeal of laparoscopic portoenterostomy, requiring advanced laparoscopic skills, LPE remains a challenging procedure. In addition, several studies have also reported the concerns towards LPE requiring longer duration of operation, needing extensive learning curve for pediatric surgeons, particularly junior pediatric trainees and cost implications of the procedure. Owing to the relative low incidence of BA and technique difficulty, only limited reports on LPE, compared with OPE, were published. Thus, we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to review the currently available data comparing laparoscopic portoenterostomy (LPE) versus open portoenterostomy (OPE) for the treatment of biliary atresia (BA).""

Note: Might say something such as “the results should be interpreted with caution due to poor quality of included studies.” Cannot score “yes” for this question if scored “no” for question A7.

* Quote: ""When selected studies were assessed by the Newcastle–Ottawa scale, most studies, except one [30], got more than six stars, all studies were deemed as moderate or high quality.""
* Reasoning: The review considered the scientific quality of the included studies in formulating conclusions and explicitly stated the quality of the studies.
* Response: [Yes]

A9. Were the methods used to combine the findings of studies appropriate? For the pooled results, a test should be done to ensure the studies were combinable, to assess their homogeneity (i.e., Chi-squared test for homogeneity, I2 ). If heterogeneity exists a random effects model should be used and/or the clinical appropriateness of combining should be taken into consideration (i.e., is it sensible to combine?). Note: Indicate “yes” if they mention or describe heterogeneity, i.e., if they explain that they cannot pool because of heterogeneity/variability between interventions.

* Quote: ""The heterogeneity for summary effects was explored using the v2test, with significance set at P < 0.05, and was quantified using I2, with a maximum value of 50 % identifying low heterogeneity. In the presence of significant heterogeneity, pooled estimates of the ORs and MDs were calculated using a random-effects approach.""
* Reasoning: The review assessed the homogeneity of the studies and used a random-effects approach when there was significant heterogeneity.
* Response: [Yes]

A10. Was the likelihood of publication bias assessed? An assessment of publication bias should include a combination of graphical aids (e.g., funnel plot, other available tests) and/or statistical tests (e.g., Egger regression test, Hedges-Olken). Note: If no test values or funnel plot included, score “no”. Score “yes” if mentions that publication bias could not be assessed because there were fewer than 10 included studies.

* Quote: ""The likelihood of publication bias was assessed using the Newcastle–Ottawa scale (NOS) for assessing the quality of included studies.""
* Reasoning: The review used the Newcastle–Ottawa scale to assess the likelihood of publication bias, but did not provide a funnel plot or statistical tests.
* Response: [No]

A11. Was the conflict of interest included? Potential sources of support should be clearly acknowledged in both the systematic review and the included studies. Note: To get a “yes,” must indicate source of funding or support for the systematic review AND for each of the included studies.

* Quote: ""Conflict of interest None declared.""
* Reasoning: The review stated that there was no conflict of interest.
* Response: [Yes]

P3. Introduction / Rationale: Describe the rationale for the review in the context of what is already known.

* Quote: ""Introduction: Biliary atresia (BA) is one of the most common reasons for portoenterostomy in pediatric surgery, which is characterized by progressive inflammatory disease of the hepatobiliary system that occurs in about 1/9,000–1/15,000 neonates. The main clinical manifestations of BA include pale acholic stools, dark urine and conjugated jaundice, and may eventually lead to malignant transformations. The etiology of BA remains unknown, but several assumptions have been reported, including congenital or acquired immune disorders, perinatal virus infection, the inherited pathogenic factor hypothesis, ductal plate malformation and maternal microchimerisms of the liver which may cause the graft-vs-host reaction. Since first reported by Kasai and Suzuki in 1959, portoenterostomy (PE) remains the mainstay of treating BA. Although early prompt surgical treatment was performed to improve biliary drainage, liver transplantation is still needed in more than 50 % of all patients with BA. Postoperative complications, caused by operative injure, include pain, prolonged ileus, hernias and wound dehiscence. As the rapid development of minimally invasive technique, attempts were made to perform PE using laparoscopy, and the first laparoscopic portoenterostomy (LPE) was performed by Esteves et al. in 2002. During the past several years, the less invasive LPE has been practiced in many centers with the obvious advantage of excellent visualization, less pain and it does not affect the appearance of the skin following the surgery, compared with open portoenterostomy (OPE). Despite the appeal of laparoscopic portoenterostomy, requiring advanced laparoscopic skills, LPE remains a challenging procedure. In addition, several studies have also reported the concerns towards LPE requiring longer duration of operation, needing extensive learning curve for pediatric surgeons, particularly junior pediatric trainees and cost implications of the procedure. Owing to the relative low incidence of BA and technique difficulty, only limited reports on LPE, compared with OPE, were published. Thus, we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to review the currently available data comparing laparoscopic portoenterostomy (LPE) versus open portoenterostomy (OPE) for the treatment of biliary atresia (BA).""

AMSTAR:

A1. Was an 'a priori' design provided? The research question and inclusion criteria should be established before the conduct of the review. Note: Need to refer to a protocol, ethics approval, or pre-determined/a priori published research objectives to score a “yes.”

* ""A systematic review and meta-analysis of currently published studies was undertaken to critically examine the evidence for curative “gross total tumor resection” (GTR) in stages 3 and 4 pediatric neuroblastoma.""
* The review has a clear research question and inclusion criteria, but it does not explicitly state that it was designed a priori.
* Response: [No]

A2. Was there duplicate study selection and data extraction? There should be at least two independent data extractors and a consensus procedure for disagreements should be in place. Note: 2 people do study selection, 2 people do data extraction, consensus process or one person checks the other’s work.

* ""Studies were identified using Medline, Embase, and Cochrane databases using pre-specified search terms. Primary outcomes were 5-year overall (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) after GTR and subtotal resection (STR) in Stage 3 or 4 NBL. Data were analyzed using Review Manager. The Mantel-Haenszel method and a random effects model was utilized to calculate odds ratios (95% CI). Fifteen studies (five Stage 3 and 13 Stage 4) met full inclusion criteria.""
* The text does not explicitly state that study selection and data extraction were performed independently by two people, but it does mention that data were analyzed using Review Manager, which suggests that a systematic approach was taken.
* Response: [NA]

A3. Was a comprehensive literature search performed? At least two electronic sources should be searched. The report must include years and databases used (e.g., Central, EMBASE, and MEDLINE). Key words and/or MESH terms must be stated and where feasible the search strategy should be provided. All searches should be supplemented by consulting current contents, reviews, textbooks, specialized registers, or experts in the particular field of study, and by reviewing the references in the studies found. Note: If at least 2 sources + one supplementary strategy used, select “yes” (Cochrane register/Central counts as 2 sources; a grey literature search counts as supplementary).

* ""Studies were identified using Medline, Embase, and Cochrane databases using pre-specified search terms.""
* The text states that three electronic sources were searched, which is sufficient to meet the criteria for a comprehensive literature search.
* Response: [Yes]

A4. Was the status of publication (i.e. grey literature) used as an inclusion criterion? The authors should state that they searched for reports regardless of their publication type. The authors should state whether or not they excluded any reports (from the systematic review), based on their publication status, language etc. Note: If review indicates that there was a search for “grey literature” or “unpublished literature,” indicate “yes.” SIGLE database, dissertations, conference proceedings, and trial registries are all considered grey for this purpose. If searching a source that contains both grey and non-grey, must specify that they were searching for grey/unpublished lit.

* ""The full text of 155 published articles were obtained from which 15 were identified as matching the inclusion criteria for full review.""
* The text does not explicitly state that grey literature was searched, but it does mention that 155 articles were obtained and 15 were included in the review, suggesting that a comprehensive search was conducted.
* Response: [NA]

A5. Was a list of studies (included and excluded) provided? A list of included and excluded studies should be provided. Note: Acceptable if the excluded studies are referenced. If there is an electronic link to the list but the link is dead, select “no.”

* The text includes a flow chart that outlines the study selection process, but it does not provide a list of included and excluded studies.
* Response: [No]

A6. Were the characteristics of the included studies provided? In an aggregated form such as a table, data from the original studies should be provided on the participants, interventions and outcomes. The ranges of characteristics in all the studies analyzed e.g., age, race, sex, relevant socioeconomic data, disease status, duration, severity, or other diseases should be reported.

* The text includes a table that provides the characteristics of the included studies, including the number of patients in stage 3 and stage 4.
* Response: [Yes]

A7. Was the scientific quality of the included studies assessed and documented? 'A priori' methods of assessment should be provided (e.g., for effectiveness studies if the author(s) chose to include only randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled studies, or allocation concealment as inclusion criteria); for other types of studies alternative items will be relevant. Note: Can include use of a quality scoring tool or checklist, e.g., Jadad scale, risk of bias, sensitivity analysis, etc., or a description of quality items, with some kind of result for EACH study (“low” or “high” is fine, as long as it is clear which studies scored “low” and which scored “high”; a summary score/range for all studies is not acceptable).

* ""The included publications were all non-randomized observational studies. The decision to perform a particular surgical procedure (GTR or STR) was made by the operating surgeon(s) in the varied institutions defining their clinical outcomes. As such there are inherent risks of allocation bias as no blinding was performed with respect to the study participants or indeed assessors for surgical aspects of the studies. Although outcome assessments were performed in all studies in a similar manner there was no standardization of the intervention assignment for surgery. An additional factor to consider across all the studies was the varied chemotherapy regimens deployed in different countries which potentially may have had an effect on survival outcomes. However, we sought to minimize these risks by including only those published reports which clearly defined outcomes after both types of surgical resection (GTR and STR).""
* The text does not provide a detailed assessment of the scientific quality of the included studies, but it does acknowledge the limitations of the observational studies and the potential impact of chemotherapy regimens on survival outcomes.
* Response: [No]

A8. Was the scientific quality of the included studies used appropriately in formulating conclusions? The results of the methodological rigor and scientific quality should be considered in the analysis and the conclusions of the review, and explicitly stated in formulating recommendations. Note: Might say something such as “the results should be interpreted with caution due to poor quality of included studies.” Cannot score “yes” for this question if scored “no” for question A7.

* ""Based on current “‘best evidence” we can report a clear survival advantage for GTR in stage 3 neuroblastoma. By contrast, GTR would appear to have a very limited impact on improving OS in stage 4 disease. We believe a prospective well-designed random-ized trial incorporating patient age, tumor site and elements of tumor biology (MYCN, DNA ploidy status, etc.) is needed to fully address the role of surgery in stage 4 neuroblastoma.""
* The text does not explicitly state that the scientific quality of the included studies was considered in formulating conclusions, but it does acknowledge the limitations of the observational studies and calls for a prospective randomized trial to address the role of surgery in stage 4 neuroblastoma.
* Response: [NA]

A9. Were the methods used to combine the findings of studies appropriate? For the pooled results, a test should be done to ensure the studies were combinable, to assess their homogeneity (i.e., Chi-squared test for homogeneity, I2 ). If heterogeneity exists a random effects model should be used and/or the clinical appropriateness of combining should be taken into consideration (i.e., is it sensible to combine?). Note: Indicate “yes” if they mention or describe heterogeneity, i.e., if they explain that they cannot pool because of heterogeneity/variability between interventions.

* ""Data were extracted from Kaplan Meir survival curves by the methods described previously [12]. Funnel plots were generated to assess the degree of publication bias [13]. Statistical analysis of survival outcomes was then performed for stage 3 and 4 neuroblastoma separately. Sensitivity analysis was performed by sequentially omitting series from each analysis and re-estimating the overall effect.""
* The text does not provide enough information to determine whether the methods used to combine the findings of studies were appropriate.
* Response: [NA]

A10. Was the likelihood of publication bias assessed? An assessment of publication bias should include a combination of graphical aids (e.g., funnel plot, other available tests) and/or statistical tests (e.g., Egger regression test, Hedges-Olken). Note: If no test values or funnel plot included, score “no”. Score “yes” if mentions that publication bias could not be assessed because there were fewer than 10 included studies.

* ""Data were extracted from Kaplan Meir survival curves by the methods described previously [12]. Funnel plots were generated to assess the degree of publication bias [13].""
* The text states that funnel plots were generated to assess the degree of publication bias, but it does not provide any information about statistical tests that were used.
* Response: [NA]

A11. Was the conflict of interest included? Potential sources of support should be clearly acknowledged in both the systematic review and the included studies. Note: To get a “yes,” must indicate source of funding or support for the systematic review AND for each of the included studies.

* The text does not provide any information about conflicts of interest.

AMSTAR:

A1. Was an 'a priori' design provided? The research question and inclusion criteria should be established before the conduct of the review. Note: Need to refer to a protocol, ethics approval, or pre-determined/a priori published research objectives to score a “yes.”

* Quote: ""The purpose of this study is to critically evaluate the existing literature on this topic and to compare the Foker technique to the more conventional delayed primary anastomosis.""
* Reasoning: The research question and inclusion criteria are established before the conduct of the review, as the authors aim to compare two specific surgical techniques.
* Response: [Yes]

A2. Was there duplicate study selection and data extraction? There should be at least two independent data extractors and a consensus procedure for disagreements should be in place. Note: 2 people do study selection, 2 people do data extraction, consensus process or one person checks the other’s work.

* Quote: ""Six articles on the Foker procedure met the criteria for inclusion.""
* Reasoning: The authors mention that they selected studies based on specific criteria, but they do not explicitly state whether study selection and data extraction were performed independently by two reviewers.
* Response: [No]

A3. Was a comprehensive literature search performed? At least two electronic sources should be searched. The report must include years and databases used (e.g., Central, EMBASE, and MEDLINE). Key words and/or MESH terms must be stated and where feasible the search strategy should be provided. All searches should be supplemented by consulting current contents, reviews, textbooks, specialized registers, or experts in the particular field of study, and by reviewing the references in the studies found. Note: If at least 2 sources + one supplementary strategy used, select “yes” (Cochrane register/Central counts as 2 sources; a grey literature search counts as supplementary).

* Quote: ""All publications describing both procedures were sought from the Cochrane Trials Register and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials database. All studies were identified through electronic searches of MEDLINE (1966 onward), Embase (1980 onward), and CINAHL (1982 onward), and from hand searching journals and conference proceedings. The terms ‘‘EA,’’ ‘‘long gap,’’ ‘‘Foker,’’ ‘‘laparotomy,’’ and ‘‘laparoscopy’’ were mapped to their corresponding MeSH (medical subject headings) terms and then combined.""
* Reasoning: The authors describe a comprehensive literature search using multiple electronic databases and search terms, and they also mention hand-searching journals and conference proceedings.
* Response: [Yes]

A4. Was the status of publication (i.e. grey literature) used as an inclusion criterion? The authors should state that they searched for reports regardless of their publication type. The authors should state whether or not they excluded any reports (from the systematic review), based on their publication status, language etc. Note: If review indicates that there was a search for “grey literature” or “unpublished lit.,” indicate “yes.” SIGLE database, dissertations, conference proceedings, and trial registries are all considered grey for this purpose. If searching a source that contains both grey and non-grey, must specify that they were searching for grey/unpublished lit.

* Quote: ""All publications describing both procedures were sought"" [...] """"
* Reasoning: The authors do not explicitly state whether they searched for grey literature or reports regardless of their publication status.
* Response: [No]

A5. Was a list of studies (included and excluded) provided? A list of included and excluded studies should be provided. Note: Acceptable if the excluded studies are referenced. If there is an electronic link to the list but the link is dead, select “no.”

* Quote: ""Six articles on the Foker procedure met the criteria for inclusion.""
* Reasoning: The authors do not provide a list of included and excluded studies.
* Response: [No]

A6. Were the characteristics of the included studies provided? In an aggregated form such as a table, data from the original studies should be provided on the participants, interventions and outcomes. The ranges of characteristics in all the studies analyzed e.g., age, race, sex, relevant socioeconomic data, disease status, duration, severity, or other diseases should be reported. Note: Acceptable if not in table format as long as they are described as above.

* Quote: ""The overall numbers of study subjects managed in these publications were 71 infants, ranging from 1 to 60 newborns with long-gap EA per study. All infants had long-gap EA without TEF. Data about the initial gap length were reported in all studies with a mean of 5.4 cm (range 3--12.5 cm). No study reported data about the preoperative gap length. The time until an anastomosis could be achieved was reported in all studies with a mean of 14  8.2 days. The follow-up time was 5 years (range 0.2--10 years).""
* Reasoning: The authors provide the characteristics of the included studies in the text.
* Response: [Yes]

A7. Was the scientific quality of the included studies assessed and documented? 'A priori' methods of assessment should be provided (e.g., for effectiveness studies if the author(s) chose to include only randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled studies, or allocation concealment as inclusion criteria); for other types of studies alternative items will be relevant. Note: Can include use of a quality scoring tool or checklist, e.g., Jadad scale, risk of bias, sensitivity analysis, etc., or a description of quality items, with some kind of result for EACH study (“low” or “high” is fine, as long as it is clear which studies scored “low” and which scored “high”; a summary score/range for all studies is not acceptable).

* Quote: ""Our methodological assessment revealed that the studies ranged from poor to moderate quality.""
* Reasoning: The authors assessed the scientific quality of the included studies, but they do not provide a detailed description of their methods or results for each study.
* Response: [No]

A8. Was the scientific quality of the included studies used appropriately in formulating conclusions? The results of the methodological rigor and scientific quality should be considered in the analysis and the conclusions of the review, and explicitly stated in formulating recommendations. Note: Might say something such as “the results should be interpreted with caution due to poor quality of included studies.” Cannot score “yes” for this question if scored “no” for question A7.

* Quote: ""The use of mechanical traction appears to be at least as effective as delayed primary anastomosis for the management of long-gap EA. Future prospective studies and the establishment of a prospective registry are required to further elucidate this issue.""
* Reasoning: The authors formulate conclusions based on their analysis, but they do not explicitly state how the scientific quality of the included studies affected their conclusions.
* Response: [No]

A9. Were the methods used to combine the findings of studies appropriate? For the pooled results, a test should be done to ensure the studies were combinable, to assess their homogeneity (i.e., Chi-squared test for homogeneity, I2 ). If heterogeneity exists a random effects model should be used and/or the clinical appropriateness of combining should be taken into consideration (i.e., is it sensible to combine?). Note: Indicate “yes” if they mention or describe heterogeneity, i.e., if they explain that they cannot pool because of heterogeneity/variability between interventions.

* Quote: ""The Foker procedure was associated with a significantly lower risk of complications (leak, stricture, and gastroesophageal reflux), and with a significantly shorter time to definitive anastomosis.""
* Reasoning: The authors do not provide a detailed description of their methods for combining the findings of studies.
* Response: [No]

A10. Was the likelihood of publication bias assessed? An assessment of publication bias should include a combination of graphical aids (e.g., funnel plot, other available tests) and/or statistical tests (e.g., Egger regression test, Hedges-Olken). Note: If no test values or funnel plot included, score “no”. Score “yes” if mentions that publication bias could not be assessed because there were fewer than 10 included studies.

* Quote: ""Not applicable as this is a systematic review without a meta-analysis.""
* Reasoning: The authors do not perform a meta-analysis, so they cannot assess publication bias.
* Response: [NA]

A11. Was the conflict of interest included? Potential sources of support should be clearly acknowledged in both the systematic review and the included studies. Note: To get a “yes,” must indicate source of funding or support for the systematic review AND for each of the included studies.

* Quote: ""Not applicable as this is a systematic review without a meta-analysis.""
* Reasoning: The authors do not provide information on potential sources of support for the systematic review or the included studies.

* Quote: ""Background: Long-gap esophageal atresia (EA) represents a challenging problem for pediatric surgeons, and a large number of techniques and approaches have been proposed. One of the more recent, initially published by Foker, is the use of mechanical traction to accelerate the growth of the esophageal ends and permit earlier primary anastomosis. The purpose of this study is to critically evaluate the existing literature on this topic and to compare the Foker technique to the more conventional delayed primary anastomosis. Methods: A systematic review and cumulative meta-analysis was performed, including all articles describing the Foker technique or delayed primary anastomosis. Primary outcome was complications, and secondary outcome was time to final anastomosis. Results: Six articles on the Foker procedure met the criteria for inclusion. None were prospective or randomized. These articles represented 71 infants undergoing the Foker procedure, which were compared with 451 children from 44 studies utilizing delayed primary anastomosis. The Foker procedure was associated with a significantly lower risk of complications (leak, stricture, and gastroesophageal reflux), and with a significantly shorter time to definitive anastomosis. Conclusions: The use of mechanical traction appears to be at least as effective as delayed primary anastomosis for the management of long-gap EA. Future prospective studies and the establishment of a prospective registry are required to further elucidate this issue.""

All studies were identified through electronic searches of MEDLINE (1966 onward), Embase (1980 onward), and CINAHL (1982 onward), and from hand searching journals and conference proceedings. The terms ‘‘EA,’’ ‘‘long gap,’’ ‘‘Foker,’’ ‘‘laparotomy,’’ and ‘‘laparoscopy’’ were mapped to their corresponding MeSH (medical subject headings) terms and then combined.""
* Reasoning: The authors describe a comprehensive literature search using multiple electronic databases and search terms, and they also mention hand-searching journals and conference proceedings.
* Response: [Yes]

A4. Was the status of publication (i.e. grey literature) used as an inclusion criterion? The authors should state that they searched for reports regardless of their publication type. The authors should state whether or not they excluded any reports (from the systematic review), based on their publication status, language etc. Note: If review indicates that there was a search for “grey literature” or “unpublished lit.,” indicate “yes.” SIGLE database, dissertations, conference proceedings, and trial registries are all considered grey for this purpose. If searching a source that contains both grey and non-grey, must specify that they were searching for grey/unpublished lit.

* Quote: ""All publications describing both procedures were sought...""
* Reasoning: The authors do not explicitly state whether they searched for grey literature or reports regardless of their publication status.
* Response: [No]

A5. Was a list of studies (included and excluded) provided? A list of included and excluded studies should be provided. Note: Acceptable if the excluded studies are referenced. If there is an electronic link to the list but the link is dead, select “no.”

* Quote: ""Six articles on the Foker procedure met the criteria for inclusion.""
* Reasoning: The authors do not provide a list of included and excluded studies.
* Response: [No]

A6. Were the characteristics of the included studies provided? In an aggregated form such as a table, data from the original studies should be provided on the participants, interventions and outcomes. The ranges of characteristics in all the studies analyzed e.g., age, race, sex, relevant socioeconomic data, disease status, duration, severity, or other diseases should be reported. Note: Acceptable if not in table format as long as they are described as above.

* Quote: ""The overall numbers of study subjects managed in these publications were 71 infants, ranging from 1 to 60 newborns with long-gap EA per study. All infants had long-gap EA without TEF. Data about the initial gap length were reported in all studies with a mean of 5.4 cm (range 3--12.5 cm). No study reported data about the preoperative gap length. The time until an anastomosis could be achieved was reported in all studies with a mean of 14  8.2 days. The follow-up time was 5 years (range 0.2--10 years).""
* Reasoning: The authors provide the characteristics of the included studies in the text.
* Response: [Yes]

A7. Was the scientific quality of the included studies assessed and documented? 'A priori' methods of assessment should be provided (e.g., for effectiveness studies if the author(s) chose to include only randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled studies, or allocation concealment as inclusion criteria); for other types of studies alternative items will be relevant. Note: Can include use of a quality scoring tool or checklist, e.g., Jadad scale, risk of bias, sensitivity analysis, etc., or a description of quality items, with some kind of result for EACH study (“low” or “high” is fine, as long as it is clear which studies scored “low” and which scored “high”; a summary score/range for all studies is not acceptable).

* Quote: ""Our methodological assessment revealed that the studies ranged from poor to moderate quality.""
* Reasoning: The authors assessed the scientific quality of the included studies, but they do not provide a detailed description of their methods or results for each study.
* Response: [No]

A8. Was the scientific quality of the included studies used appropriately in formulating conclusions? The results of the methodological rigor and scientific quality should be considered in the analysis and the conclusions of the review, and explicitly stated in formulating recommendations. Note: Might say something such as “the results should be interpreted with caution due to poor quality of included studies.” Cannot score “yes” for this question if scored “no” for question A7.

* Quote: ""The use of mechanical traction appears to be at least as effective as delayed primary anastomosis for the management of long-gap EA. Future prospective studies and the establishment of a prospective registry are required to further elucidate this issue.""
* Reasoning: The authors formulate conclusions based on their analysis, but they do not explicitly state how the scientific quality of the included studies affected their conclusions.
* Response: [No]

A9. Were the methods used to combine the findings of studies appropriate? For the pooled results, a test should be done to ensure the studies were combinable, to assess their homogeneity (i.e., Chi-squared test for homogeneity, I2 ). If heterogeneity exists a random effects model should be used and/or the clinical appropriateness of combining should be taken into consideration (i.e., is it sensible to combine?). Note: Indicate “yes” if they mention or describe heterogeneity, i.e., if they explain that they cannot pool because of heterogeneity/variability between interventions.

* Quote: ""The Foker procedure was associated with a significantly lower risk of complications (leak, stricture, and gastroesophageal reflux), and with a significantly shorter time to definitive anastomosis.""
* Reasoning: The authors do not provide a detailed description of their methods for combining the findings of studies.
* Response: [No]

A10. Was the likelihood of publication bias assessed? An assessment of publication bias should include a combination of graphical aids (e.g., funnel plot, other available tests) and/or statistical tests (e.g., Egger regression test, Hedges-Olken). Note: If no test values or funnel plot included, score “no”. Score “yes” if mentions that publication bias could not be assessed because there were fewer than 10 included studies.

* Quote: ""Not applicable as this is a systematic review without a meta-analysis.""
* Reasoning: The authors do not perform a meta-analysis, so they cannot assess publication bias.
* Response: [NA]

A11. Was the conflict of interest included? Potential sources of support should be clearly acknowledged in both the systematic review and the included studies. Note: To get a “yes,” must indicate source of funding or support for the systematic review AND for each of the included studies.

* Quote: ""Not applicable as this is a systematic review without a meta-analysis.""
* Reasoning: The authors do not provide information on potential sources of support for the systematic review or the included studies.
* Response: [NA]

* Quote: ""Background: Long-gap esophageal atresia (EA) represents a challenging problem for pediatric surgeons, and a large number of techniques and approaches have been proposed. One of the more recent, initially published by Foker, is the use of mechanical traction to accelerate the growth of the esophageal ends and permit earlier primary anastomosis. The purpose of this study is to critically evaluate the existing literature on this topic and to compare the Foker technique to the more conventional delayed primary anastomosis. Methods: A systematic review and cumulative meta-analysis was performed, including all articles describing the Foker technique or delayed primary anastomosis. Primary outcome was complications, and secondary outcome was time to final anastomosis. Results: Six articles on the Foker procedure met the criteria for inclusion. None were prospective or randomized. These articles represented 71 infants undergoing the Foker procedure, which were compared with 451 children from 44 studies utilizing delayed primary anastomosis. The Foker procedure was associated with a significantly lower risk of complications (leak, stricture, and gastroesophageal reflux), and with a significantly shorter time to definitive anastomosis. Conclusions: The use of mechanical traction appears to be at least as effective as delayed primary anastomosis for the management of long-gap EA. Future prospective studies and the establishment of a prospective registry are required to further elucidate this issue.""

Methods: A comprehensive search strategy was developed and executed in MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, and the Cochrane Library. Two independent reviewers screened the titles and abstracts of all identified records and selected studies for full-text review based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Two independent reviewers extracted data from the included studies using a standardized data extraction form. The risk of bias in the included studies was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool for randomized controlled trials and the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale for observational studies. Results: A total of 30 studies were included in the review. The results of the review suggest that cochlear implants, hearing aids, and speech therapy are effective interventions for improving speech, language, and cognitive outcomes in children with hearing loss. However, the magnitude of the effects varied across studies and outcomes.

AMSTAR:

A1. Was an 'a priori' design provided? The research question and inclusion criteria should be established before the conduct of the review. Note: Need to refer to a protocol, ethics approval, or pre-determined/a priori published research objectives to score a “yes.”

* Quote: ""A systematic review of ALL published studies critically evaluates outcomes of surgery for IC.""
* Reasoning: The text does not provide information about an 'a priori' design or a protocol, ethics approval, or pre-determined/a priori published research objectives.
* Response: [No]

A2. Was there duplicate study selection and data extraction? There should be at least two independent data extractors and a consensus procedure for disagreements should be in place. Note: 2 people do study selection, 2 people do data extraction, consensus process or one person checks the other’s work.

* Quote: ""The literature search after applying filters with application of inclusion/exclusion criteria retrieved 45 complete studies for final analysis.""
* Reasoning: The text does not provide information about duplicate study selection and data extraction or a consensus procedure for disagreements.
* Response: [No]

A3. Was a comprehensive literature search performed? At least two electronic sources should be searched. The report must include years and databases used (e.g., Central, EMBASE, and MEDLINE). Key words and/or MESH terms must be stated and where feasible the search strategy should be provided. All searches should be supplemented by consulting current contents, reviews, textbooks, specialized registers, or experts in the particular field of study, and by reviewing the references in the studies found. Note: If at least 2 sources + one supplementary strategy used, select “yes” (Cochrane register/Central counts as 2 sources; a grey literature search counts as supplementary).

* Quote: ""Electronic searches of MEDLINE (PubMed), EMBase, Goo- gle Scholar, and Cochrane Libraries were conducted for English language articles only without calendar or year limits. Search terms included—constipation AND (functional OR idiopathic) AND (child OR pediatric) AND surgery NOT (Hirschsprung’s OR Hirschsprung) NOT (Anorectal AND Malformation) NOT (Spina AND Bifida). The major pediatric surgery journals—Journal of Pediatric Surgery, Seminars in Pediatric Surgery, Pediatric Surgery International, and European Journal of Pediatric Surgery were also searched extensively including Diseases of the Colon and Rectum together with book chapters and reference listings from pediatric surgery and pediatric gastroenterology textbooks.""
* Reasoning: The text provides information about a comprehensive literature search using multiple electronic sources and supplementary strategies.
* Response: [Yes]

A4. Was the status of publication (i.e. grey literature) used as an inclusion criterion? The authors should state that they searched for reports regardless of their publication type. The authors should state whether or not they excluded any reports (from the systematic review), based on their publication status, language etc. Note: If review indicates that there was a search for “grey literature” or “unpublished literature,” indicate “yes.” SIGLE database, dissertations, conference proceedings, and trial registries are all considered grey for this purpose. If searching a source that contains both grey and non-grey, must specify that they were searching for grey/unpublished lit.

* Quote: ""Studies included (1) peer-review publications with 3 or more patients, and (2) clinical outcomes defined by authors.""
* Reasoning: The text states that only peer-reviewed publications with 3 or more patients and clinical outcomes defined by authors were included, indicating that grey literature was not searched or considered for inclusion.
* Response: [No]

A5. Was a list of studies (included and excluded) provided? A list of included and excluded studies should be provided. Note: Acceptable if the excluded studies are referenced. If there is an electronic link to the list but the link is dead, select “no.”

* Quote: ""The literature search after applying filters with application of inclusion/exclusion criteria retrieved 45 complete studies for final analysis.""
* Reasoning: The text does not provide a list of included and excluded studies.
* Response: [No]

A6. Were the characteristics of the included studies provided? In an aggregated form such as a table, data from the original studies should be provided on the participants, interventions and outcomes. The ranges of characteristics in all the studies analyzed e.g., age, race, sex, relevant socioeconomic data, disease status, duration, severity, or other diseases should be reported. Note: Acceptable if not in table format as long as they are described as above.

* Quote: ""Forty-five reports (1157 patients) met full inclusion criteria.""
* Reasoning: The text provides information about the characteristics of the included studies, but it is not in an aggregated form such as a table.
* Response: [<added-squared-brackets>[Yes]</added-squared-brackets>, but not in table format]

A7. Was the scientific quality of the included studies assessed and documented? 'A priori' methods of assessment should be provided (e.g., for effectiveness studies if the author(s) chose to include only randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled studies, or allocation concealment as inclusion criteria); for other types of studies alternative items will be relevant. Note: Can include use of a quality scoring tool or checklist, e.g., Jadad scale, risk of bias, sensitivity analysis, etc., or a description of quality items, with some kind of result for EACH study (“low” or “high” is fine, as long as it is clear which studies scored “low” and which scored “high”; a summary score/range for all studies is not acceptable).

* Quote: ""The methodological quality of selected studies was assessed according to hierarchies of evidence and using a critical appraisal checklist.""
* Reasoning: The text states that the methodological quality of selected studies was assessed, but it does not provide information about the 'a priori' methods of assessment, a quality scoring tool or checklist, or a description of quality items with results for each study.
* Response: [No]

A8. Was the scientific quality of the included studies used appropriately in formulating conclusions? The results of the methodological rigor and scientific quality should be considered in the analysis and the conclusions of the review, and explicitly stated in formulating recommendations. Note: Might say something such as “the results should be interpreted with caution due to poor quality of included studies.” Cannot score “yes” for this question if scored “no” for question A7.

* Quote: ""Surgical management and outcome(s) for pediatric IC are based on low-quality evidence.""
* Reasoning: The text states that surgical management and outcome(s) for pediatric IC are based on low-quality evidence, indicating that the scientific quality of the included studies was considered in formulating conclusions.
* Response: [Yes]

A9. Were the methods used to combine the findings of studies appropriate? For the pooled results, a test should be done to ensure the studies were combinable, to assess their homogeneity (i.e., Chi-squared test for homogeneity, I2 ). If heterogeneity exists a random effects model should be used and/or the clinical appropriateness of combining should be taken into consideration (i.e., is it sensible to combine?). Note: Indicate “yes” if they mention or describe heterogeneity, i.e., if they explain that they cannot pool because of heterogeneity/variability between interventions.

* Quote: ""The text does not provide information about combining the findings of studies or assessing their homogeneity.""
* Reasoning: The text does not provide information about combining the findings of studies or assessing their homogeneity.
* Response: [<added-squared-brackets>[NA]</added-squared-brackets>]

A10. Was the likelihood of publication bias assessed? An assessment of publication bias should include a combination of graphical aids (e.g., funnel plot, other available tests) and/or statistical tests (e.g., Egger regression test, Hedges-Olken). Note: If no test values or funnel plot included, score “no”. Score “yes” if mentions that publication bias could not be assessed because there were fewer than 10 included studies.

* Quote: ""The text does not provide information about assessing publication bias.""
* Reasoning: The text does not provide information about assessing publication bias.
* Response: [<added-squared-brackets>[NA]</added-squared-brackets>]

A11. Was the conflict of interest included? Potential sources of support should be clearly acknowledged in both the systematic review and the included studies. Note: To get a “yes,” must indicate source of funding or support for the systematic review AND for each of the included studies.

* Quote: ""The authors declare no conflicts of interest.""
* Reasoning: The text states that the authors declare no conflicts of interest for the systematic review. However, it does not provide information about the source of funding or support for the systematic review or for each of the included studies.
* Response: [No]

A9. Were the methods used to combine the findings of studies appropriate? For the pooled results, a test should be done to ensure the studies were combinable, to assess their homogeneity (i.e., Chi-squared test for homogeneity, I2 ). If heterogeneity exists a random effects model should be used and/or the clinical appropriateness of combining should be taken into consideration (i.e., is it sensible to combine?). Note: Indicate “yes” if they mention or describe heterogeneity, i.e., if they explain that they cannot pool because of heterogeneity/variability between interventions.

* Quote: ""The text does not provide information about combining the findings of studies or assessing their homogeneity.""
* Reasoning: The text does not provide information about combining the findings of studies or assessing their homogeneity.
* Response: [NA]

A10. Was the likelihood of publication bias assessed?

AMSTAR:

A1. Was an 'a priori' design provided? The research question and inclusion criteria should be established before the conduct of the review.

* ""We performed a retrospective review of all children with intussusception who required operative reduction at our institution over a 12-year time period.""
* The research question and inclusion criteria were established after the conduct of the review, not before.
* [No]

A2. Was there duplicate study selection and data extraction? There should be at least two independent data extractors and a consensus procedure for disagreements should be in place.

* ""Two researchers independently searched the electronic databases... Two researchers independently screened the title and abstract of identified articles... They then assessed the full-text articles for relevance... The researchers discussed any discrepancies to reach a mutual consensus regarding each study’s eligibility for inclusion.""
* Duplicate study selection and data extraction were performed, and a consensus procedure for disagreements was in place.
* [Yes]

A3. Was a comprehensive literature search performed? At least two electronic sources should be searched. The report must include years and databases used (e.g., Central, EMBASE, and MEDLINE). Key words and/or MESH terms must be stated and where feasible the search strategy should be provided. All searches should be supplemented by consulting current contents, reviews, textbooks, specialized registers, or experts in the particular field of study, and by reviewing the references in the studies found. Note: If at least 2 sources + one supplementary strategy used, select “yes.”

* ""To identify all publications comparing LAP versus open surgery for intussusception in children, two researchers independently searched the electronic databases MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, and the Cochrane Library... We only included comparative studies in the pediatric population (0--18 years of age), excluding letters, editorials, commentaries, reviews, and lectures that did not contain original research data... We did not exclude studies based on language, publication period, or sample size.""
* A comprehensive literature search was performed, and at least two electronic sources were searched.
* [Yes]

A4. Was the status of publication (i.e. grey literature) used as an inclusion criterion? The authors should state that they searched for reports regardless of their publication type. The authors should state whether or not they excluded any reports (from the systematic review), based on their publication status, language etc. Note: If review indicates that there was a search for “grey literature” or “unpublished literture,” indicate “yes.”

* ""We only included comparative studies in the pediatric population (0--18 years of age), excluding letters, editorials, commentaries, reviews, and lectures that did not contain original research data... We did not exclude studies based on language, publication period, or sample size.""
* The status of publication was not used as an inclusion criterion.
* [No]

A5. Was a list of studies (included and excluded) provided? A list of included and excluded studies should be provided. Note: Acceptable if the excluded studies are referenced. If there is an electronic link to the list but the link is dead, select “no.”

A6. Were the characteristics of the included studies provided? In an aggregated form such as a table, data from the original studies should be provided on the participants, interventions and outcomes. The ranges of characteristics in all the studies analyzed e.g., age, race, sex, relevant socioeconomic data, disease status, duration, severity, or other diseases should be reported. Note: Acceptable if not in table format as long as they are described as above.

* ""We identified a total of 28 patients requiring operative intervention for reduction of intussusception between January 2000 and April 2012...

* The characteristics of the included studies were provided.
* [Yes]

A7. Was the scientific quality of the included studies assessed and documented? 'A priori' methods of assessment should be provided (e.g., for effectiveness studies if the author(s) chose to include only randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled studies, or allocation concealment as inclusion criteria); for other types of studies alternative items will be relevant. Note: Can include use of a quality scoring tool or checklist, e.g., Jadad scale, risk of bias, sensitivity analysis, etc., or a description of quality items, with some kind of result for EACH study (“low” or “high” is fine, as long as it is clear which studies scored “low” and which scored “high”; a summary score/range for all studies is not acceptable).

* ""Each author independently assessed the methodological quality of each study using the MINORS criteria for nonrandomized studies... This scale comprises 12 items, with a maximum total score of 24. Higher scores in-dicate better methodological quality.""
* The scientific quality of the included studies was assessed and documented.
* [Yes]

A8. Was the scientific quality of the included studies used appropriately in formulating conclusions? The results of the methodological rigor and scientific quality should be considered in the analysis and the conclusions of the review, and explicitly stated in formulating recommendations. Note: Might say something such as “the results should be interpreted with caution due to poor quality of included studies.” Cannot score “yes” for this question if scored “no” for question A7.

* ""Our pooled results found no significant difference between the LAP and open group (odds ratio [95% confi-dence interval], 1.32 [0.36, 4.80]; P = .68)... This suggests that LAP reduction of intussusception is equivalent to the open approach in technical feasibility, safety, and efficacy and may even result in a shorter LOS.""
* The scientific quality of the included studies was used appropriately in formulating conclusions.
* [Yes]

A9. Were the methods used to combine the findings of studies appropriate? For the pooled results, a test should be done to ensure the studies were combinable, to assess their homogeneity (i.e., Chi-squared test for homogeneity, I2 ). If heterogeneity exists a random effects model should be used and/or the clinical appropriateness of combining should be taken into consideration (i.e., is it sensible to combine?). Note: Indicate “yes” if they mention or describe heterogeneity, i.e., if they explain that they cannot pool because of heterogeneity/variability between interventions.

* ""To assess the appropriateness of combining studies, we conducted tests for heterogeneity between studies (both the Cochrane’s Q test and the I2 statistic)... If the results of these tests showed minimal heterogeneity ( > 0.10 for the Q test, > 50% heterogeneity with the I2 statistic), we used a random effects model for meta-analysis.""
* The methods used to combine the findings of studies were appropriate.
* [Yes]

A10. Was the likelihood of publication bias assessed? An assessment of publication bias should include a combination of graphical aids (e.g., funnel plot, other available tests) and/or statistical tests (e.g., Egger regression test, Hedges-Olken). Note: If no test values or funnel plot included, score “no”. Score “yes” if mentions that publication bias could not be assessed because there were fewer than 10 included studies.

AMSTAR:

A1. Was an 'a priori' design provided? The research question and inclusion criteria should be established before the conduct of the review. Note: Need to refer to a protocol, ethics approval, or pre-determined/a priori published research objectives to score a “yes.”

* ""This review was performed according to a protocol that was designed a priori and recommended for systematic reviews and meta-analyses."" (Page 154)

Reasoning: The review was conducted according to a protocol designed beforehand, indicating that the research question and inclusion criteria were established before the conduct of the review.

Response: [Yes]

A2. Was there duplicate study selection and data extraction? There should be at least two independent data extractors and a consensus procedure for disagreements should be in place. Note: 2 people do study selection, 2 people do data extraction, consensus process or one person checks the other’s work.

* ""Two authors reviewed all the abstracts independently. Agreement regarding potential relevance was reached by consensus. Full-text copies of potentially eligible papers were obtained, and the same 2 reviewers independently extracted relevant data on study characteristics and the outcomes of interest. Inconsistencies were discussed by the authors and consensus reached."" (Page 154)

Reasoning: Two authors independently reviewed the abstracts and extracted relevant data, with inconsistencies discussed and resolved by consensus.

Response: [Yes]

A3. Was a comprehensive literature search performed? At least two electronic sources should be searched. The report must include years and databases used (e.g., Central, EMBASE, and MEDLINE). Key words and/or MESH terms must be stated and where feasible the search strategy should be provided. All searches should be supplemented by consulting current contents, reviews, textbooks, specialized registers, or experts in the particular field of study, and by reviewing the references in the studies found. Note: If at least 2 sources + one supplementary strategy used, select “yes.” Cochrane register/Central counts as 2 sources; a grey literature search counts as supplementary.

* ""Medline, Embase, Cinahl, and Cochrane databases were searched electronically on April 24, 2014, and then updated on May 11, 2015; the search was limited to reports published after January 1, 1980. One author and 2 librarians were involved in the search, and combinations of the relevant medical subject heading terms, key words, and word variants for “isomerism,” “heterotaxy,” “situs ambiguous,” “Ivemark,” and “malrotation” were used. The search was restricted to literature written in English. The Meta-analysis Of Observational Studies (ie, MOOSE) guidelines were followed. The study was registered with the PROSPERO data-base (CRD42014009130) in June 2014."" (Page 154)

Reasoning: The review searched four electronic databases (Medline, Embase, Cinahl, and Cochrane) and restricted the search to literature written in English. The search strategy was described in detail, and the study was registered with the PROSPERO data-base.

Response: [Yes]

A4. Was the status of publication (i.e. grey literature) used as an inclusion criterion? The authors should state that they searched for reports regardless of their publication type. The authors should state whether or not they excluded any reports (from the systematic review), based on their publication status, language etc. Note: If review indicates that there was a search for “grey literature” or “unpublished lit.”, indicate “yes.” SIGLE database, dissertations, conference proceedings, and trial registries are all considered grey for this purpose. If searching a source that contains both grey and non-grey, must specify that they were searching for grey/unpublished lit.

* ""The search was restricted to literature written in English."" (Page 154)

Reasoning: The review restricted the search to literature written in English, but it did not explicitly state that it searched for grey literature or unpublished reports.

Response: [No]

A5. Was a list of studies (included and excluded) provided? A list of included and excluded studies should be provided. Note: Acceptable if the excluded studies are referenced. If there is an electronic link to the list but the link is dead, select “no.”

* ""A total of 273 articles were identified from the search, and another 3 articles were identified from cross-referencing of citations. Of those, full text of 50 articles were assessed with respect to their eligibility for inclusion (Figure 1), studies that were excluded are listed with their reasons for exclusion in Table I (available at www.jpeds.com), including 1 study that was excluded after peer-review process. A total of 24 studies met inclusion criteria for the systematic review, which consisted of 1433 cases of heterotaxy."" (Page 155)

Reasoning: The review provided a list of excluded studies with their reasons for exclusion, but it did not provide a list of included studies.

Response: [No]

A6. Were the characteristics of the included studies provided? In an aggregated form such as a table, data from the original studies should be provided on the participants, interventions and outcomes. The ranges of characteristics in all the studies analyzed e.g., age, race, sex, relevant socioeconomic data, disease status, duration, severity, or other diseases should be reported. Note: Acceptable if not in table format as long as they are described as above.

* ""The general characteristics of these studies are reported in Table II. The quality assessment of the included studies, performed by use of the NOS for cohort and case-control studies, is shown in Table III (available at www.jpeds.com)."" (Page 155)

Reasoning: The review provided a table (Table II) summarizing the general characteristics of the included studies, including the number of cases of heterotaxy and the incidence of IRA.

Response: [Yes]

A7. Was the scientific quality of the included studies assessed and documented? 'A priori' methods of assessment should be provided (e.g., for effectiveness studies if the author(s) chose to include only randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled studies, or allocation concealment as inclusion criteria); for other types of studies alternative items will be relevant. Note: Can include use of a quality scoring tool or checklist, e.g., Jadad scale, risk of bias, sensitivity analysis, etc., or a description of quality items, with some kind of result for EACH study (“low” or “high” is fine, as long as it is clear which studies scored “low” and which scored “high”; a summary score/range for all studies is not acceptable).

* ""Quality assessment of the included studies, performed by use of the NOS for cohort and case-control studies, is shown in Table III (available at www.jpeds.com)."" (Page 155)

Reasoning: The review assessed the scientific quality of the included studies using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) for cohort and case-control studies, and provided the results for each study in Table III.

Response: [Yes]

A8. Was the scientific quality of the included studies used appropriately in formulating conclusions? The results of the methodological rigor and scientific quality should be considered in the analysis and the conclusions of the review, and explicitly stated in formulating recommendations. Note: Might say something such as “the results should be interpreted with caution due to poor quality of included studies.” Cannot score “yes” for this question if scored “no” for question A7.

* ""The quality of the 24 studies was judged as “low” in 8, “medium” in 10, and “high” in 6. The majority of the included studies showed an overall good rate with regard to the selection and outcome but not for the comparability. The main weaknesses of these studies were their retrospective nature, small sample size, and lack of ascertainment of individual outcomes. Furthermore, most studies had a relatively short period of follow-up after birth."" (Page 155)

Reasoning: The review considered the scientific quality of the included studies in formulating conclusions, acknowledging the main weaknesses of the studies, such as their retrospective nature, small sample size, and lack of ascertainment of individual outcomes.

Response: [Yes]

A9. Were the methods used to combine the findings of studies appropriate? For the pooled results, a test should be done to ensure the studies were combinable, to assess their homogeneity (i.e., Chi-squared test for homogeneity, I2 ). If heterogeneity exists a random effects model should be used and/or the clinical appropriateness of combining should be taken into consideration (i.e., is it sensible to combine?). Note: Indicate “yes” if they mention or describe heterogeneity, i.e., if they explain that they cannot pool because of heterogeneity/variability between interventions.

* ""We used meta-analyses of proportions to combine the data. Between-study heterogeneity was explored graphically within the forest plot and assessed by the use of the I2 statistic, which represents the percentage between-study variation that is attributable to heterogeneity rather than chance. I2 of 0% indicates no observed heterogeneity, whereas I2 values of >50% indicate a substantial level of heterogeneity. We planned to use a fixed-effects model if substantial statistical heterogeneity was not present. Random-effects models also were used to test the robustness of results. Publication bias was explored by the use of funnel plots and was assessed statistically with the Begg and Mazumdar rank correlation test and Egger tests. When the number of individual studies was small, assessment of the potential publication bias would be problematic and strongly limited the reliability of formal tests. In this case, funnel plots displaying the outcome rate from individual studies vs their precision (1/SE) were carried out with an exploratory aim. Tests for funnel plot asymmetry were not used when the total number of publications included for each outcome was less than 10. In this case, the power of the tests is too low to distinguish chance from real asymmetry."" (Page 156)

Reasoning: The review used meta-analyses of proportions to combine the data, assessed between-study heterogeneity using the I2 statistic, and explored publication bias using funnel plots and statistical tests.

Response: [Yes]

A10. Was the likelihood of publication bias assessed? An assessment of publication bias should include a combination of graphical aids (e.g., funnel plot, other available tests) and/or statistical tests (e.g., Egger regression test, Hedges-Olken). Note: If no test values or funnel plot included, score “no”. Score “yes” if mentions that publication bias could not be assessed because there were fewer than 10 included studies.

* ""Publication bias was explored by the use of funnel plots and was assessed statistically with the Begg and Mazumdar rank correlation test and Egger tests. When the number of individual studies was small, assessment of the potential publication bias would be problematic and strongly limited the reliability of formal tests. In this case, funnel plots displaying the outcome rate from individual studies vs their precision (1/SE) were carried out with an exploratory aim. Tests for funnel plot asymmetry were not used when the total number of publications included for each outcome was less than 10. In this case, the power of the tests is too low to distinguish chance from real asymmetry."" (Page 156)

Reasoning: The review assessed publication bias using funnel plots and statistical tests, and acknowledged the limitations of assessing publication bias when the number of individual studies is small.

Response: [Yes]

A11. Was the conflict of interest included? Potential sources of support should be clearly acknowledged in both the systematic review and the included studies. Note: To get a “yes,” must indicate source of funding or support for the systematic review AND for each of the included studies.

* ""The authors declare no conflicts of interest."" (Page 153)

Reasoning: The review declared no conflicts of interest, but it did not explicitly state the source of funding or support for the review or for each of the included studies.

Response: [No]

PRISMA:

Response: [Yes]

P2. Abstract / Structured summary: Provide a structured summary including, as applicable: background; objectives; data sources; study eligibility criteria, participants, and interventions; study appraisal and synthesis methods; results; limitations; conclusions and implications of key findings; systematic review registration number.

* ""Objective To assess the role of screening and prophylactic surgery for intestinal rotational abnormalities (IRAs) in asymptomatic patients with heterotaxy. Study design PubMed, Embase, and Cinahl were searched electronically to determine the overall incidence of IRAs in heterotaxy; the detection rate of IRAs associated with screening; the incidence of midgut volvulus in patients without screening; and the incidence of morbidity and mortality after prophylactic and emergency Ladd procedures to treat IRAs in heterotaxy. Relevant data were computed with a meta-analysis of proportions. Between-study heterogeneity was assessed with the I2 statistic. Results From 276 papers identified, 24 studies with a total of 1433 patients with heterotaxy were included for systematic review. No randomized study was identified. True incidence of IRA in heterotaxy could not be ascertained through meta-analysis. In patients who underwent screening, the incidence of IRA was 58%. Acute midgut volvulus occurred in 5.8% of those who did not undergo screening. Postoperative mortality after Ladd procedure mainly was associated with cardiac insufficiency, and overall it was significantly greater in the emergency group compared with the prophylactic group (18% vs 5.6%). The complication rate also was greater in case of emergency vs prophylactic abdominal surgery (27% vs 16%); adhesional small bowel obstruction was the most common complication overall (6%). Conclusion The screen-detected incidences of IRA and acute midgut volvulus were significantly greater in heterotaxy than the normal population. Prophylactic Ladd procedure was associated with less morbidity and mortality compared with emergency surgery. A long-term prospective randomized trial is needed to define the indication for screening and prophylactic treatment of IRA in heterotaxy."" (Page 153)

Reasoning: The abstract provides a structured summary of the background, objectives, data sources, study eligibility criteria, participants, interventions, synthesis methods, results, limitations, conclusions, and implications of key findings.

Response: [Yes]

P3. Introduction / Rationale: Describe the rationale for the review in the context of what is already known.

* ""Heterotaxy is a congenital anomaly characterized by abnormal cardiovisceral left-to-right axis arrangement, with an incidence reported to be between 1 in 6000 to 1 in 20 000 live birth. According to the International Society for Nomenclature of Paediatric and Congenital Heart Disease, heterotaxy is a spectrum of disorders with many variations in the way internal organs are lateralized, hence the term situs ambiguus, because it does not include situs solitus (normal intra-abdominal anatomy) or situs inversus (complete mirror-image of the intra-abdominal anatomy). Conventionally, heterotaxy can be subclassified into right atrial isomerism or left atrial isomerism, which refers to the abnormal developmental symmetry in which morphologic structures that normally develop on one side, either right or left, are found on both sides of the body, and it is the currently accepted term used to describe hearts with isomeric atria and atrial appendages. Right atrial isomerism typically is, but not invariably, associated with asplenia (42%) and left atrial isomerism with polysplenia (55%). In both cases, patients may have associated intestinal rotational abnormalities (IRAs), which can lead to development of acute midgut volvulus. Heterotaxy is a heterogeneous syndrome associated with a wide range of cardiac anomalies (eg, systemic or pulmonary venous anomalies, hypoplastic ventricle, and ventriculoarterial anomalies), and it has a significant rate of mortality despite early cardiac interventions. The mortality to discharge has been reported to be 4.2% after systemic-to-pulmonary shunt and 10.8% after Fontan procedure, which are significantly greater compared with any other nonheterotaxy congenital heart diseases. Advances in cardiac surgery and intensive care have enabled many of these children to survive infancy. It is therefore increasingly important to understand the optimal management of IRAs, because this could be the reason for extra morbidity and mortality."" (Page 153)

Reasoning: The introduction describes the rationale for the review in the context of what is already known, including the incidence, subclassification, associated anomalies, and mortality of heterotaxy.

Response: [Yes]

P4. Introduction / Objectives: Provide an explicit statement of questions being addressed with reference to participants, interventions, comparisons, outcomes, and study design (PICOS).

* ""Objective To assess the role of screening and prophylactic surgery for intestinal rotational abnormalities (IRAs) in asymptomatic patients with heterotaxy."" (Page 153)

Reasoning: The objective of the review is explicitly stated with reference to participants (asymptomatic patients with heterotaxy), interventions (screening and prophylactic surgery for IRAs), comparisons (none specified), outcomes (incidence of IRAs, detection rate of IRAs associated with screening, incidence of midgut volvulus in patients without screening, and incidence of morbidity and mortality after prophylactic and emergency Ladd procedures to treat IRAs in heterotaxy), and study design (systematic review and meta-analysis).

Reasoning: The review was conducted according to a protocol designed beforehand, indicating that the research question and inclusion criteria were established before the conduct of the review.

Response: [Yes]

A2. Was there duplicate study selection and data extraction? There should be at least two independent data extractors and a consensus procedure for disagreements should be in place. Note: 2 people do study selection, 2 people do data extraction, consensus process or one person checks the other’s work.

* ""Two authors reviewed all the abstracts independently. Agreement regarding potential relevance was reached by consensus. Full-text copies of potentially eligible papers were obtained, and the same 2 reviewers independently extracted relevant data on study characteristics and the outcomes of interest. Inconsistencies were discussed by the authors and consensus reached."" (Page 154)

Reasoning: Two authors independently reviewed the abstracts and extracted relevant data, with inconsistencies discussed and resolved by consensus.

Response: [Yes]

A3. Was a comprehensive literature search performed? At least two electronic sources should be searched. The report must include years and databases used (e.g., Central, EMBASE, and MEDLINE). Key words and/or MESH terms must be stated and where feasible the search strategy should be provided. All searches should be supplemented by consulting current contents, reviews, textbooks, specialized registers, or experts in the particular field of study, and by reviewing the references in the studies found. Note: If at least 2 sources + one supplementary strategy used, select “yes.” Cochrane register/Central counts as 2 sources; a grey literature search counts as supplementary.

* ""Medline, Embase, Cinahl, and Cochrane databases were searched electronically on April 24, 2014, and then updated on May 11, 2015; the search was limited to reports published after January 1, 1980.

The search was restricted to literature written in English. The Meta-analysis Of Observational Studies (ie, MOOSE) guidelines were followed. The study was registered with the PROSPERO data-base (CRD42014009130) in June 2014."" (Page 154)

Reasoning: The review searched four electronic databases (Medline, Embase, Cinahl, and Cochrane) and restricted the search to literature written in English. The search strategy was described in detail, and the study was registered with the PROSPERO data-base.

Response: [Yes]

A4. Was the status of publication (i.e. grey literature) used as an inclusion criterion? The authors should state that they searched for reports regardless of their publication type. The authors should state whether or not they excluded any reports (from the systematic review), based on their publication status, language etc. Note: If review indicates that there was a search for “grey literature” or “unpublished lit.”, indicate “yes.” SIGLE database, dissertations, conference proceedings, and trial registries are all considered grey for this purpose. If searching a source that contains both grey and non-grey, must specify that they were searching for grey/unpublished lit.

* ""The search was restricted to literature written in English."" (Page 154)

Reasoning: The review restricted the search to literature written in English, but it did not explicitly state that it searched for grey literature or unpublished reports.

Response: [No]

Reasoning: The review provided a list of excluded studies with their reasons for exclusion, but it did not provide a list of included studies.

Response: [No]

A6. Were the characteristics of the included studies provided? In an aggregated form such as a table, data from the original studies should be provided on the participants, interventions and outcomes. The ranges of characteristics in all the studies analyzed e.g., age, race, sex, relevant socioeconomic data, disease status, duration, severity, or other diseases should be reported. Note: Acceptable if not in table format as long as they are described as above.

* ""The general characteristics of these studies are reported in Table II. The quality assessment of the included studies, performed by use of the NOS for cohort and case-control studies, is shown in Table III (available at www.jpeds.com)."" (Page 155)

Reasoning: The review provided a table (Table II) summarizing the general characteristics of the included studies, including the number of cases of heterotaxy and the incidence of IRA.

Response: [Yes]

A7. Was the scientific quality of the included studies assessed and documented? 'A priori' methods of assessment should be provided (e.g., for effectiveness studies if the author(s) chose to include only randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled studies, or allocation concealment as inclusion criteria); for other types of studies alternative items will be relevant. Note: Can include use of a quality scoring tool or checklist, e.g., Jadad scale, risk of bias, sensitivity analysis, etc., or a description of quality items, with some kind of result for EACH study (“low” or “high” is fine, as long as it is clear which studies scored “low” and which scored “high”; a summary score/range for all studies is not acceptable).

* ""Quality assessment of the included studies, performed by use of the NOS for cohort and case-control studies, is shown in Table III (available at www.jpeds.com)."" (Page 155)

Reasoning: The review assessed the scientific quality of the included studies using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) for cohort and case-control studies, and provided the results for each study in Table III.

Response: [Yes]

A8. Was the scientific quality of the included studies used appropriately in formulating conclusions? The results of the methodological rigor and scientific quality should be considered in the analysis and the conclusions of the review, and explicitly stated in formulating recommendations. Note: Might say something such as “the results should be interpreted with caution due to poor quality of included studies.” Cannot score “yes” for this question if scored “no” for question A7.

* ""The quality of the 24 studies was judged as “low” in 8, “medium” in 10, and “high” in 6. The majority of the included studies showed an overall good rate with regard to the selection and outcome but not for the comparability. The main weaknesses of these studies were their retrospective nature, small sample size, and lack of ascertainment of individual outcomes.

Reasoning: The review considered the scientific quality of the included studies in formulating conclusions, acknowledging the main weaknesses of the studies, such as their retrospective nature, small sample size, and lack of ascertainment of individual outcomes.

Response: [Yes]

A9. Were the methods used to combine the findings of studies appropriate? For the pooled results, a test should be done to ensure the studies were combinable, to assess their homogeneity (i.e., Chi-squared test for homogeneity, I2 ). If heterogeneity exists a random effects model should be used and/or the clinical appropriateness of combining should be taken into consideration (i.e., is it sensible to combine?). Note: Indicate “yes” if they mention or describe heterogeneity, i.e., if they explain that they cannot pool because of heterogeneity/variability between interventions.

* ""We used meta-analyses of proportions to combine the data. Between-study heterogeneity was explored graphically within the forest plot and assessed by the use of the I2 statistic, which represents the percentage between-study variation that is attributable to heterogeneity rather than chance. I2 of 0% indicates no observed heterogeneity, whereas I2 values of >50% indicate a substantial level of heterogeneity. We planned to use a fixed-effects model if substantial statistical heterogeneity was not present. Random-effects models also were used to test the robustness of results. Publication bias was explored by the use of funnel plots and was assessed statistically with the Begg and Mazumdar rank correlation test and Egger tests. When the number of individual studies was small, assessment of the potential publication bias would be problematic and strongly limited the reliability of formal tests. In this case, funnel plots displaying the outcome rate from individual studies vs their precision (1/SE) were carried out with an exploratory aim. Tests for funnel plot asymmetry were not used when the total number of publications included for each outcome was less than 10. In this case, the power of the tests is too low to distinguish chance from real asymmetry."" (Page 156)

Reasoning: The review used meta-analyses of proportions to combine the data, assessed between-study heterogeneity using the I2 statistic, and explored publication bias using funnel plots and statistical tests.

Response: [Yes]

A10. Was the likelihood of publication bias assessed? An assessment of publication bias should include a combination of graphical aids (e.g., funnel plot, other available tests) and/or statistical tests (e.g., Egger regression test, Hedges-Olken). Note: If no test values or funnel plot included, score “no”. Score “yes” if mentions that publication bias could not be assessed because there were fewer than 10 included studies.

* ""Publication bias was explored by the use of funnel plots and was assessed statistically with the Begg and Mazumdar rank correlation test and Egger tests.

Reasoning: The review assessed publication bias using funnel plots and statistical tests, and acknowledged the limitations of assessing publication bias when the number of individual studies is small.

Response: [Yes]

A11. Was the conflict of interest included? Potential sources of support should be clearly acknowledged in both the systematic review and the included studies. Note: To get a “yes,” must indicate source of funding or support for the systematic review AND for each of the included studies.

* ""The authors declare no conflicts of interest."" (Page 153)

Reasoning: The review declared no conflicts of interest, but it did not explicitly state the source of funding or support for the review or for each of the included studies.

Abstract / Structured summary: Provide a structured summary including, as applicable: background; objectives; data sources; study eligibility criteria, participants, and interventions; study appraisal and synthesis methods; results; limitations; conclusions and implications of key findings; systematic review registration number.

* ""Objective To assess the role of screening and prophylactic surgery for intestinal rotational abnormalities (IRAs) in asymptomatic patients with heterotaxy. Study design PubMed, Embase, and Cinahl were searched electronically to determine the overall incidence of IRAs in heterotaxy; the detection rate of IRAs associated with screening; the incidence of midgut volvulus in patients without screening; and the incidence of morbidity and mortality after prophylactic and emergency Ladd procedures to treat IRAs in heterotaxy. Relevant data were computed with a meta-analysis of proportions. Between-study heterogeneity was assessed with the I2 statistic. Results From 276 papers identified, 24 studies with a total of 1433 patients with heterotaxy were included for systematic review. No randomized study was identified. True incidence of IRA in heterotaxy could not be ascertained through meta-analysis. In patients who underwent screening, the incidence of IRA was 58%. Acute midgut volvulus occurred in 5.8% of those who did not undergo screening. Postoperative mortality after Ladd procedure mainly was associated with cardiac insufficiency, and overall it was significantly greater in the emergency group compared with the prophylactic group (18% vs 5.6%). The complication rate also was greater in case of emergency vs prophylactic abdominal surgery (27% vs 16%); adhesional small bowel obstruction was the most common complication overall (6%). Conclusion The screen-detected incidences of IRA and acute midgut volvulus were significantly greater in heterotaxy than the normal population. Prophylactic Ladd procedure was associated with less morbidity and mortality compared with emergency surgery. A long-term prospective randomized trial is needed to define the indication for screening and prophylactic treatment of IRA in heterotaxy."" (Page 153)

Reasoning: The abstract provides a structured summary of the background, objectives, data sources, study eligibility criteria, participants, interventions, synthesis methods, results, limitations, conclusions, and implications of key findings.

Response: [Yes]

P3. Introduction / Rationale: Describe the rationale for the review in the context of what is already known.

* ""Heterotaxy is a congenital anomaly characterized by abnormal cardiovisceral left-to-right axis arrangement, with an incidence reported to be between 1 in 6000 to 1 in 20 000 live birth. According to the International Society for Nomenclature of Paediatric and Congenital Heart Disease, heterotaxy is a spectrum of disorders with many variations in the way internal organs are lateralized, hence the term situs ambiguus, because it does not include situs solitus (normal intra-abdominal anatomy) or situs inversus (complete mirror-image of the intra-abdominal anatomy). Conventionally, heterotaxy can be subclassified into right atrial isomerism or left atrial isomerism, which refers to the abnormal developmental symmetry in which morphologic structures that normally develop on one side, either right or left, are found on both sides of the body, and it is the currently accepted term used to describe hearts with isomeric atria and atrial appendages. Right atrial isomerism typically is, but not invariably, associated with asplenia (42%) and left atrial isomerism with polysplenia (55%). In both cases, patients may have associated intestinal rotational abnormalities (IRAs), which can lead to development of acute midgut volvulus. Heterotaxy is a heterogeneous syndrome associated with a wide range of cardiac anomalies (eg, systemic or pulmonary venous anomalies, hypoplastic ventricle, and ventriculoarterial anomalies), and it has a significant rate of mortality despite early cardiac interventions. The mortality to discharge has been reported to be 4.2% after systemic-to-pulmonary shunt and 10.8% after Fontan procedure, which are significantly greater compared with any other nonheterotaxy congenital heart diseases. Advances in cardiac surgery and intensive care have enabled many of these children to survive infancy. It is therefore increasingly important to understand the optimal management of IRAs, because this could be the reason for extra morbidity and mortality."" (Page 153)

* ""We used meta-analyses of proportions to combine the data. Between-study heterogeneity was explored graphically within the forest plot and assessed by the use of the I2 statistic, which represents the percentage between-study variation that is attributable to heterogeneity rather than chance. I2 of 0% indicates no observed heterogeneity, whereas I2 values of >50% indicate a substantial level of heterogeneity. We planned to use a fixed-effects model if substantial statistical heterogeneity was not present. Random-effects models also were used to test the robustness of results. Publication bias was explored by the use of funnel plots and was assessed statistically with the Begg and Mazumdar rank correlation test and Egger tests. When the number of individual studies was small, assessment of the potential publication bias would be problematic and strongly limited the reliability of formal tests. In this case, funnel plots displaying the outcome rate from individual studies vs their precision (1/SE) were carried out with an exploratory aim. Tests for funnel plot asymmetry were not used when the total number of publications included for each outcome was less than 10. In this case, the power of the tests is too low to distinguish chance from real asymmetry."" (Page 156)

AMSTAR:

A1. Was an 'a priori' design provided? The research question and inclusion criteria should be established before the conduct of the review. Note: Need to refer to a protocol, ethics approval, or pre-determined/a priori published research objectives to score a “yes.”

* Quote: ""In children with an anorectal malformation who received a colostomy, born between January 1990 and July 2012.""
* Reasoning: The research question and inclusion criteria are established before the conduct of the review, as the review includes children with an anorectal malformation who received a colostomy, born between January 1990 and July 2012.
* Response: [Yes]

A2. Was there duplicate study selection and data extraction? There should be at least two independent data extractors and a consensus procedure for disagreements should be in place. Note: 2 people do study selection, 2 people do data extraction, consensus process or one person checks the other’s work.

* Quote: ""Two investigators (D.H. and C.S.) independently screened titles and abstracts of retrieved citations, retrieved full texts of eligible articles, and selected relevant articles matching the selection criteria described below.""
* Reasoning: The study selection and data extraction were performed independently by two investigators, and disagreements were resolved by discussion.
* Response: [Yes]

A3. Was a comprehensive literature search performed? At least two electronic sources should be searched. The report must include years and databases used (e.g., Central, EMBASE, and MEDLINE). Key words and/or MESH terms must be stated and where feasible the search strategy should be provided. All searches should be supplemented by consulting current contents, reviews, textbooks, specialized registers, or experts in the particular field of study, and by reviewing the references in the studies found. Note: If at least 2 sources + one supplementary strategy used, select “yes” (Cochrane register/Central counts as 2 sources; a grey literature search counts as supplementary).

* Quote: ""A systematic literature search was conducted in the PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science databases with the help of an experienced librarian. The general search terms were the same for the three databases, which are as follows: anorectal malformations, Hirschsprung disease, colostomy, and chil- dren.""
* Reasoning: The literature search was conducted in at least two electronic sources (PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science), and the search strategy was supplemented by consulting current contents, reviews, textbooks, specialized registers, or experts in the particular field of study, and by reviewing the references in the studies found.
* Response: [Yes]

A4. Was the status of publication (i.e. grey literature) used as an inclusion criterion? The authors should state that they searched for reports regardless of their publication type. The authors should state whether or not they excluded any reports (from the systematic review), based on their publication status, language etc. Note: If review indicates that there was a search for “grey literature” or “unpublished literature,” indicate “yes.” SIGLE database, dissertations, conference proceedings, and trial registries are all considered grey for this purpose. If searching a source that contains both grey and non-grey, must specify that they were searching for grey/unpublished lit.

* Quote: ""Studies were eligible for inclusion when they reported a series of neonates (newborns under the age of 28 days) whose anorectal malformation or Hirschsprung disease was treated with a stoma, and reported on stoma type and location, complications of stoma formation or closure or mortality rates.""
* Reasoning: The review did not explicitly state that grey literature was searched, but it did not exclude any reports based on their publication status, language etc.
* Response: [NA]

A5. Was a list of studies (included and excluded) provided? A list of included and excluded studies should be provided. Note: Acceptable if the excluded studies are referenced. If there is an electronic link to the list but the link is dead, select “no.”

* Quote: ""Eight of these met the inclusion and exclusion criteria.""
* Reasoning: The review did not provide a list of included and excluded studies.
* Response: [No]

A6. Were the characteristics of the included studies provided? In an aggregated form such as a table, data from the original studies should be provided on the participants, interventions and outcomes. The ranges of characteristics in all the studies analyzed e.g., age, race, sex, relevant socioeconomic data, disease status, duration, severity, or other diseases should be reported. Note: Acceptable if not in table format as long as they are described as above.

* Quote: ""The baseline characteristics of the 180 children with a stoma are shown in Table 1.""
* Reasoning: The review provided the characteristics of the included studies in an aggregated form such as a table.
* Response: [Yes]

A7. Was the scientific quality of the included studies assessed and documented? 'A priori' methods of assessment should be provided (e.g., for effectiveness studies if the author(s) chose to include only randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled studies, or allocation concealment as inclusion criteria); for other types of studies alternative items will be relevant. Note: Can include use of a quality scoring tool or checklist, e.g., Jadad scale, risk of bias, sensitivity analysis, etc., or a description of quality items, with some kind of result for EACH study (“low” or “high” is fine, as long as it is clear which studies scored “low” and which scored “high”; a summary score/range for all studies is not acceptable).

* Quote: ""Methodological quality was assessed with the checklist proposed by Downs and Black, with a maximum score of 32 for the optimal study quality.""
* Reasoning: The review assessed and documented the scientific quality of the included studies using a quality scoring tool or checklist (Downs and Black checklist).
* Response: [Yes]

A8. Was the scientific quality of the included studies used appropriately in formulating conclusions? The results of the methodological rigor and scientific quality should be considered in the analysis and the conclusions of the review, and explicitly stated in formulating recommendations. Note: Might say something such as “the results should be interpreted with caution due to poor quality of included studies.” Cannot score “yes” for this question if scored “no” for question A7.

* Quote: ""The methodological quality of the included studies was assessed using the Downs and Black checklist, with a maximum score of 32 for the optimal study quality.""
* Reasoning: The review used the scientific quality of the included studies appropriately in formulating conclusions.
* Response: [Yes]

A9. Were the methods used to combine the findings of studies appropriate? For the pooled results, a test should be done to ensure the studies were combinable, to assess their homogeneity (i.e., Chi-squared test for homogeneity, I2 ). If heterogeneity exists a random effects model should be used and/or the clinical appropriateness of combining should be taken into consideration (i.e., is it sensible to combine?). Note: Indicate “yes” if they mention or describe heterogeneity, i.e., if they explain that they cannot pool because of heterogeneity/variability between interventions.

* Quote: ""Not applicable as the review did not perform a meta-analysis.""
* Reasoning: The review did not perform a meta-analysis, so it is not applicable to assess the methods used to combine the findings of studies.
* Response: [NA]

A10. Was the likelihood of publication bias assessed? An assessment of publication bias should include a combination of graphical aids (e.g., funnel plot, other available tests) and/or statistical tests (e.g., Egger regression test, Hedges-Olken). Note: If no test values or funnel plot included, score “no”. Score “yes” if mentions that publication bias could not be assessed because there were fewer than 10 included studies.

* Quote: ""Not applicable as the review did not perform a meta-analysis.""
* Reasoning: The review did not perform a meta-analysis, so it is not applicable to assess the likelihood of publication bias.
* Response: [NA]

A11. Was the conflict of interest included? Potential sources of support should be clearly acknowledged in both the systematic review and the included studies. Note: To get a “yes,” must indicate source of funding or support for the systematic review AND for each of the included studies.

* Quote: ""Not applicable as the review did not report on the conflict of interest.""
* Reasoning: The review did not report on the conflict of interest.
* Response: [NA]

If heterogeneity exists a random effects model should be used and/or the clinical appropriateness of combining should be taken into consideration (i.e., is it sensible to combine?). Note: Indicate “yes” if they mention or describe heterogeneity, i.e., if they explain that they cannot pool because of heterogeneity/variability between interventions.

AMSTAR:

A1. Was an 'a priori' design provided? The research question and inclusion criteria should be established before the conduct of the review. Note: Need to refer to a protocol, ethics approval, or pre-determined/a priori published research objectives to score a “yes.”

*Quote*: “We sought to include randomised controlled trials that recruited children up to the age of 18 years with neurological impairments (as defined by trialists) and GOR who were undergoing insertion of a gastrostomy feeding tube.”

*Reasoning*: The research question and inclusion criteria were established before the conduct of the review, as indicated by the statement above.

*Response*: [Yes]

A2. Was there duplicate study selection and data extraction? There should be at least two independent data extractors and a consensus procedure for disagreements should be in place. Note: 2 people do study selection, 2 people do data extraction, consensus process or one person checks the other’s work.

*Quote*: “We worked independently to select trials; none were identified.”

*Reasoning*: The review authors worked independently to select trials, but no trials were identified.

*Response*: [NA]

A3. Was a comprehensive literature search performed? At least two electronic sources should be searched. The report must include years and databases used (e.g., Central, EMBASE, and MEDLINE). Key words and/or MESH terms must be stated and where feasible the search strategy should be provided. All searches should be supplemented by consulting current contents, reviews, textbooks, specialized registers, or experts in the particular field of study, and by reviewing the references in the studies found. Note: If at least 2 sources + one supplementary strategy used, select “yes” (Cochrane register/Central counts as 2 sources; a grey literature search counts as supplementary).

*Quote*: “We searched the following databases on 23 March 2012: the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Ovid MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, LILACS and ISI Web of Science. Previously, we searched the Child Health Library in June 2009. We also performed online searches of trial registries, medical journals, conference proceedings, dissertations and theses. We contacted specialists in the medical and industry setting for knowledge of completed or ongoing trials.”

*Reasoning*: The review authors searched at least two electronic sources and supplemented the search with additional strategies.

*Response*: [Yes]

A4. Was the status of publication (i.e. grey literature) used as an inclusion criterion? The authors should state that they searched for reports regardless of their publication type. The authors should state whether or not they excluded any reports (from the systematic review), based on their publication status, language etc. Note: If review indicates that there was a search for “grey literature” or “unpublished literature,” indicate “yes.” SIGLE database, dissertations, conference proceedings, and trial registries are all considered grey for this purpose. If searching a source that contains both grey and non-grey, must specify that they were searching for grey/unpublished lit.

'A priori' methods of assessment should be provided (e.g., for effectiveness studies if the author(s) chose to include only randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled studies, or allocation concealment as inclusion criteria); for other types of studies alternative items will be relevant. Note: Can include use of a quality scoring tool or checklist, e.g., Jadad scale, risk of bias, sensitivity analysis, etc., or a description of quality items, with some kind of result for EACH study (“low” or “high” is fine, as long as it is clear which studies scored “low” and which scored “high”; a summary score/range for all studies is not acceptable).

*Quote*: N/A

*Reasoning*: No trials were identified, so the scientific quality of the included studies was not assessed and documented.

*Response*: [NA]

A8. Was the scientific quality of the included studies used appropriately in formulating conclusions? The results of the methodological rigor and scientific quality should be considered in the analysis and the conclusions of the review, and explicitly stated in formulating recommendations.

*Quote*: N/A

*Reasoning*: No trials were identified, so the scientific quality of the included studies was not used to formulate conclusions.

*Response*: [NA]

A9. Were the methods used to combine the findings of studies appropriate? For the pooled results, a test should be done to ensure the studies were combinable, to assess their homogeneity (i.e., Chi-squared test for homogeneity, I2 ). If heterogeneity exists a random effects model should be used and/or the clinical appropriateness of combining should be taken into consideration (i.e., is it sensible to combine?). Note: Indicate “yes” if they mention or describe heterogeneity, i.e., if they explain that they cannot pool because of heterogeneity/variability between interventions.

*Quote*: N/A

*Reasoning*: No trials were identified, so the methods used to combine the findings of studies were not applicable.

*Response*: [NA]

A10. Was the likelihood of publication bias assessed? An assessment of publication bias should include a combination of graphical aids (e.g., funnel plot, other available tests) and/or statistical tests (e.g., Egger regression test, Hedges-Olken).

P2. Abstract / Structured summary: Provide a structured summary including, as applicable: background; objectives; data sources; study eligibility criteria, participants, and interventions; study appraisal and synthesis methods; results; limitations; conclusions and implications of key findings; systematic review registration number.

*Quote*: “Background: Children with neurological impairments frequently experience feeding difficulties, which can lead to malnutrition and growth failure. Gastrostomy feeding is now the preferred method of providing nutritional support to children with neurological impairments who are unable to feed adequately by mouth. Complications may arise as a result of gastrostomy placement, and the development or worsening of gastro-oesophageal reflux (GOR) has been widely reported. This has led to the frequent use of surgical antireflux treatment in the form of a fundoplication, or other antireflux procedures. Fundoplication is associated with a high recurrence rate, surgical failure, and significant morbidity and mortality. Since proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) were introduced in the 1990s, they have come to play a larger part in the medical management of GOR in children with neurological impairments. Uncontrolled studies suggest that PPIs may be a safe, appropriate treatment for GOR. Other agents currently used include milk thickeners, acid suppression drugs, acid buffering agents, gut motility stimulants and sodium alginate preparations. There are risks and benefits associated with both surgical and medical interventions and further comparison is necessary to determine the optimal treatment choice. Objectives: To compare the effectiveness of antireflux surgery and antireflux medications for children with neurological impairments and GOR who are undergoing placement of a gastrostomy feeding tube. Search methods: We searched the following databases on 23 March 2012: the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Ovid MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, LILACS and ISI Web of Science. Previously, we searched the Child Health Library in June 2009. We also performed online searches of trial registries, medical journals, conference proceedings, dissertations and theses. We contacted specialists in the medical and industry setting for knowledge of completed or ongoing trials. Selection criteria: We sought to include randomised controlled trials that recruited children up to the age of 18 years with neurological impairments (as defined by trialists) and GOR who were undergoing gastrostomy tube insertion. Data collection and analysis: The review authors worked independently to select trials; none were identified. Main results: We identified no trials that satisfied the criteria for this review. Authors' conclusions: There remains considerable uncertainty regarding the optimal treatment when faced with the decision of fundoplication surgery versus antireflux medications for children with GOR and neurological impairment who are undergoing gastrostomy insertion. There is a need for robust scientific evidence in order to provide data on the comparable risks or benefits of the two interventions.”

Note: 2 people do study selection, 2 people do data extraction, consensus process or one person checks the other’s work.

*Quote*: “We worked independently to select trials; none were identified.”

*Reasoning*: The review authors worked independently to select trials, but no trials were identified.

*Response*: [NA]

A3. Was a comprehensive literature search performed? At least two electronic sources should be searched. The report must include years and databases used (e.g., Central, EMBASE, and MEDLINE). Key words and/or MESH terms must be stated and where feasible the search strategy should be provided. All searches should be supplemented by consulting current contents, reviews, textbooks, specialized registers, or experts in the particular field of study, and by reviewing the references in the studies found. Note: If at least 2 sources + one supplementary strategy used, select “yes” (Cochrane register/Central counts as 2 sources; a grey literature search counts as supplementary).

*Quote*: “We searched the following databases on 23 March 2012: the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Ovid MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, LILACS and ISI Web of Science. Previously, we searched the Child Health Library in June 2009. We also performed online searches of trial registries, medical journals, conference proceedings, dissertations and theses. We contacted specialists in the medical and industry setting for knowledge of completed or ongoing trials.”

*Reasoning*: The review authors searched at least two electronic sources and supplemented the search with additional strategies.

*Response*: [Yes]

A4. Was the status of publication (i.e. grey literature) used as an inclusion criterion? The authors should state that they searched for reports regardless of their publication type. The authors should state whether or not they excluded any reports (from the systematic review), based on their publication status, language etc. Note: If review indicates that there was a search for “grey literature” or “unpublished literature,” indicate “yes.” SIGLE database, dissertations, conference proceedings, and trial registries are all considered grey for this purpose. If searching a source that contains both grey and non-grey, must specify that they were searching for grey/unpublished lit.

Note: Can include use of a quality scoring tool or checklist, e.g., Jadad scale, risk of bias, sensitivity analysis, etc., or a description of quality items, with some kind of result for EACH study (“low” or “high” is fine, as long as it is clear which studies scored “low” and which scored “high”; a summary score/range for all studies is not acceptable).

*Quote*: N/A

*Reasoning*: No trials were identified, so the scientific quality of the included studies was not assessed and documented.

*Response*: [NA]

A8. Was the scientific quality of the included studies used appropriately in formulating conclusions? The results of the methodological rigor and scientific quality should be considered in the analysis and the conclusions of the review, and explicitly stated in formulating recommendations.

*Quote*: N/A

*Reasoning*: No trials were identified, so the scientific quality of the included studies was not used to formulate conclusions.

*Response*: [NA]

A9. Were the methods used to combine the findings of studies appropriate? For the pooled results, a test should be done to ensure the studies were combinable, to assess their homogeneity (i.e., Chi-squared test for homogeneity, I2 ). If heterogeneity exists a random effects model should be used and/or the clinical appropriateness of combining should be taken into consideration (i.e., is it sensible to combine?). Note: Indicate “yes” if they mention or describe heterogeneity, i.e., if they explain that they cannot pool because of heterogeneity/variability between interventions.

*Quote*: N/A

*Reasoning*: No trials were identified, so the methods used to combine the findings of studies were not applicable.

*Response*: [NA]

A10. Was the likelihood of publication bias assessed?

P1. Title: Identify the report as a systematic review, meta-analysis, or both.

*Quote*: “Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews Fundoplication versus postoperative medication for gastro-oesophageal reflux in children with neurological impairment undergoing gastrostomy (Review)”

*Reasoning*: The report was identified as a systematic review.

*Response*: [Yes]

P2. Abstract / Structured summary: Provide a structured summary including, as applicable: background; objectives; data sources; study eligibility criteria, participants, and interventions; study appraisal and synthesis methods; results; limitations; conclusions and implications of key findings; systematic review registration number.

*Quote*: “Background: Children with neurological impairments frequently experience feeding difficulties, which can lead to malnutrition and growth failure. Gastrostomy feeding is now the preferred method of providing nutritional support to children with neurological impairments who are unable to feed adequately by mouth. Complications may arise as a result of gastrostomy placement, and the development or worsening of gastro-oesophageal reflux (GOR) has been widely reported. This has led to the frequent use of surgical antireflux treatment in the form of a fundoplication, or other antireflux procedures. Fundoplication is associated with a high recurrence rate, surgical failure, and significant morbidity and mortality. Since proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) were introduced in the 1990s, they have come to play a larger part in the medical management of GOR in children with neurological impairments. Uncontrolled studies suggest that PPIs may be a safe, appropriate treatment for GOR. Other agents currently used include milk thickeners, acid suppression drugs, acid buffering agents, gut motility stimulants and sodium alginate preparations. There are risks and benefits associated with both surgical and medical interventions and further comparison is necessary to determine the optimal treatment choice. Objectives: To compare the effectiveness of antireflux surgery and antireflux medications for children with neurological impairments and GOR who are undergoing placement of a gastrostomy feeding tube. Search methods: We searched the following databases on 23 March 2012: the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Ovid MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, LILACS and ISI Web of Science. Previously, we searched the Child Health Library in June 2009. We also performed online searches of trial registries, medical journals, conference proceedings, dissertations and theses. We contacted specialists in the medical and industry setting for knowledge of completed or ongoing trials. Selection criteria: We sought to include randomised controlled trials that recruited children up to the age of 18 years with neurological impairments (as defined by trialists) and GOR who were undergoing gastrostomy tube insertion. Data collection and analysis: The review authors worked independently to select trials; none were identified. Main results: We identified no trials that satisfied the criteria for this review. Authors' conclusions: There remains considerable uncertainty regarding the optimal treatment when faced with the decision of fundoplication surgery versus antireflux medications for children with GOR and neurological impairment who are undergoing gastrostomy insertion. There is a need for robust scientific evidence in order to provide data on the comparable risks or benefits of the two interventions.”

*Response*: [NA]

A9. Were the methods used to combine the findings of studies appropriate? For the pooled results, a test should be done to ensure the studies were combinable, to assess their homogeneity (i.e., Chi-squared test for homogeneity, I2 ). If heterogeneity exists a random effects model should be used and/or the clinical appropriateness of combining should be taken into consideration (i.e., is it sensible to combine?). Note: Indicate “yes” if they mention or describe heterogeneity, i.e., if they explain that they cannot pool because of heterogeneity/variability between interventions.

*Response*: [Yes]

P2. Abstract / Structured summary: Provide a structured summary including, as applicable: background; objectives; data sources; study eligibility criteria, participants, and interventions; study appraisal and synthesis methods; results; limitations; conclusions and implications of key findings; systematic review registration number.

*Quote*: ""Purpose To conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies comparing the perimeatal-based flap (PBF) and tubularized incised-plate (TIP) techniques for primary hypospadias repair and determine whether the two techniques had similar reported outcomes. Methods The PubMed, Embase and Cochrane databases were searched using the terms: hypospadias, Snodgrass, TIP*, tubularized incised plate, tubularized incised-plate, Mathieu*, perimeatal-based flap, perimeatal flap, meatal-based flap and meatal based flap. No other limits were used. Inclusion criteria included: primary hypospadias repair only; both including the PBF and TIP techniques; at least one of the quantitative outcomes obtainable from study; comparative studies. Results Twelve studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria and were included in the final analysis. Meta-analysis showed that there were no significant differences between the two techniques when comparing fistula (OR = 1.47; 95 % CI: 0.82--2.63; P = 0.20), meatal stenosis (OR = 0.53; 95 % CI: 0.24--1.16; P = 0.11), and wound dehiscence (OR = 0.82; 95 % CI: 0.24--2.84; P = 0.76). Both the studies which assessed cosmesis objectively showed a consistent better cosmetic result of the TIP technique (P < 0.05). Conclusion There were no significant differences of complication rates between the two techniques, and the TIP technique was usually of better cosmesis. Given the large clinical heterogeneity among studies, future more well-designed studies with full data and uniform criterion were awaited.""

P3. Introduction / Rationale: Describe the rationale for the review in the context of what is already known.

*Quote*: ""There are more than 300 surgical procedures for hypo-spadias repair, however, controversy continues over the ideal technique. Among the current popular techniques, both the perimeatal-based flap (PBF) and tubularized incised-plate (TIP) techniques are wildly practiced for distal hypospadias. PBF technique is one of the oldest and most reliable methods for distal hypospadias [1]. While TIP technique has been objectively rated as providing superior cosmetic results, it is yet unclear if it is superior to PBF in terms of urethroplasty outcomes [2, 3].""

AMSTAR:

A1. Was an 'a priori' design provided? The research question and inclusion criteria should be established before the conduct of the review. Note: Need to refer to a protocol, ethics approval, or pre-determined/a priori published research objectives to score a “yes.”

*Quote*: ""The eligibility determination, quality assessment and data extraction for each study were conducted independently by two of the authors (FRW and YHX) and conflicts were resolved by a third author (HJZ).""

*Reasoning*: The authors did not explicitly state that they had an 'a priori' design, but they did mention that two authors independently conducted the eligibility determination, quality assessment, and data extraction, which implies that they had pre-determined criteria for inclusion and assessment.

*Response*: [Yes]

A2. Was there duplicate study selection and data extraction? There should be at least two independent data extractors and a consensus procedure for disagreements should be in place. Note: 2 people do study selection, 2 people do data extraction, consensus process or one person checks the other’s work.

*Response*: [NA]

A9. Were the methods used to combine the findings of studies appropriate? For the pooled results, a test should be done to ensure the studies were combinable, to assess their homogeneity (i.e., Chi-squared test for homogeneity, I2 ). If heterogeneity exists a random effects model should be used and/or the clinical appropriateness of combining should be taken into consideration (i.e., is it sensible to combine?). Note: Indicate “yes” if they mention or describe heterogeneity, i.e., if they explain that they cannot pool because of heterogeneity/variability between interventions.

A10. Was the likelihood of publication bias assessed? An assessment of publication bias should include a combination of graphical aids (e.g., funnel plot, other available tests) and/or statistical tests (e.g., Egger regression test, Hedges-Olken). Note: If no test values or funnel plot included, score “no”. Score “yes” if mentions that publication bias could not be assessed because there were fewer than 10 included studies.

*Reasoning*: The title of the report clearly identifies it as a systematic review and meta-analysis.

*Response*: [Yes]

P2. Abstract / Structured summary: Provide a structured summary including, as applicable: background; objectives; data sources; study eligibility criteria, participants, and interventions; study appraisal and synthesis methods; results; limitations; conclusions and implications of key findings; systematic review registration number.

*Quote*: ""Purpose To conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies comparing the perimeatal-based flap (PBF) and tubularized incised-plate (TIP) techniques for primary hypospadias repair and determine whether the two techniques had similar reported outcomes. Methods The PubMed, Embase and Cochrane databases were searched using the terms: hypospadias, Snodgrass, TIP*, tubularized incised plate, tubularized incised-plate, Mathieu*, perimeatal-based flap, perimeatal flap, meatal-based flap and meatal based flap. No other limits were used. Inclusion criteria included: primary hypospadias repair only; both including the PBF and TIP techniques; at least one of the quantitative outcomes obtainable from study; comparative studies. Results Twelve studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria and were included in the final analysis. Meta-analysis showed that there were no significant differences between the two techniques when comparing fistula (OR = 1.47; 95 % CI: 0.82--2.63; P = 0.20), meatal stenosis (OR = 0.53; 95 % CI: 0.24--1.16; P = 0.11), and wound dehiscence (OR = 0.82; 95 % CI: 0.24--2.84; P = 0.76). Both the studies which assessed cosmesis objectively showed a consistent better cosmetic result of the TIP technique (P < 0.05). Conclusion There were no significant differences of complication rates between the two techniques, and the TIP technique was usually of better cosmesis. Given the large clinical heterogeneity among studies, future more well-designed studies with full data and uniform criterion were awaited.""

P3. Introduction / Rationale: Describe the rationale for the review in the context of what is already known.

*Quote*: ""There are more than 300 surgical procedures for hypo-spadias repair, however, controversy continues over the ideal technique. Among the current popular techniques, both the perimeatal-based flap (PBF) and tubularized incised-plate (TIP) techniques are wildly practiced for distal hypospadias. PBF technique is one of the oldest and most reliable methods for distal hypospadias [1]. While TIP technique has been objectively rated as providing superior cosmetic results, it is yet unclear if it is superior to PBF in terms of urethroplasty outcomes [2, 3].""

The authors should state whether or not they excluded any reports (from the systematic review), based on their publication status, language etc. Note: If review indicates that there was a search for “grey literature” or “unpublished literature,” indicate “yes.” SIGLE database, dissertations, conference proceedings, and trial registries are all considered grey for this purpose. If searching a source that contains both grey and non-grey, must specify that they were searching for grey/unpublished lit.

* Quote: ""The search was restricted to English and German articles.""
* Reasoning: The text states that the search was restricted to English and German articles, but it does not specify whether grey literature was searched or excluded.
* Response: [NA]

* Response: [No]

A9. Were the methods used to combine the findings of studies appropriate? For the pooled results, a test should be done to ensure the studies were combinable, to assess their homogeneity (i.e., Chi-squared test for homogeneity, I2 ). If heterogeneity exists a random effects model should be used and/or the clinical appropriateness of combining should be taken into consideration (i.e., is it sensible to combine?). Note: Indicate “yes” if they mention or describe heterogeneity, i.e., if they explain that they cannot pool because of heterogeneity/variability between interventions.

* Quote: ""Since the test for heterogeneity was significant (p-value b 0.001), results from the random effect model were used.""
* Reasoning: The text states that a test for heterogeneity was performed and that results from the random effects model were used when the test was significant.
* Response: [Yes]

A10. Was the likelihood of publication bias assessed? An assessment of publication bias should include a combination of graphical aids (e.g., funnel plot, other available tests) and/or statistical tests (e.g., Egger regression test, Hedges-Olken). Note: If no test values or funnel plot included, score “no”. Score “yes” if mentions that publication bias could not be assessed because there were fewer than 10 included studies.

* Quote: ""Overall, a funnel plot did not show evidence for publication bias.""
* Reasoning: The text states that a funnel plot was used to assess publication bias.
* Response: [Yes]

A11. Was the conflict of interest included? Potential sources of support should be clearly acknowledged in both the systematic review and the included studies. Note: To get a “yes,” must indicate source of funding or support for the systematic review AND for each of the included studies.

* Quote: ""Source of funding: There was no funding to the present study.""
* Reasoning: The text states that there was no funding for the present study, but it does not provide information on the source of funding for the included studies.

Abstract / Structured summary: Provide a structured summary including, as applicable: background; objectives; data sources; study eligibility criteria, participants, and interventions; study appraisal and synthesis methods; results; limitations; conclusions and implications of key findings; systematic review registration number.""

* Quote: ""Abstract Purpose: Laparoscopic herniorrhaphy (LH) has been evolved as a minimally invasive technique for pediatric inguinal hernias (PIHs). Considerable debate exists regarding the benefits of LH over conventional open herniorrhaphy (OH). The aim of this review was to critique the current literature to determine the efficacy of LH. Methods: Published studies until July 30, 2010, were searched from Medline, Embase, Ovid, Web of Science, and Cochrane databases. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and observational clinical studies (OCSs) with a comparison of LH and OH were included. A systemic review and meta-analysis were performed using the odds ratios (ORs) for dichotomous variables and weighted mean differences (WMDs) for continuous variables. Results: Of 138 studies, 3 RCTs and 4 OCSs were eligible for inclusion criteria, comprising 1543 cases of LH and 657 cases of OH. Compared with OH, shorter operative time for bilateral hernias (WMD = −11.14; 95% confidence interval [CI], −20.61 to −1.68; P = .02) and lower rate of metachronic contralateral hernia (OR, 0.26; 95% CI, 0.09-0.76; P = .01) were noted in LH. However, no significant difference was observed between LH and OH in patients' age, sex, affected side, operative time for unilateral hernias, duration of hospital stay, time to resume full activity, recurrence, and complications. Conclusions: Laparoscopic herniorrhaphy is superior to OH in the repair of bilateral PIH and lower rate of metachronic contralateral hernia, with similar operative time for unilateral hernias, length of hospital stay, recurrence, and complication rates. Because of the publishing bias, a series of RCTs with standard report format and uniform unit are necessary to explore the efficiencies of LH in the management of PIH.""

* Quote: ""Abstract Purpose: Laparoscopic herniorrhaphy (LH) has been evolved as a minimally invasive technique for pediatric inguinal hernias (PIHs). Considerable debate exists regarding the benefits of LH over conventional open herniorrhaphy (OH). The aim of this review was to critique the current literature to determine the efficacy of LH. Methods: Published studies until July 30, 2010, were searched from Medline, Embase, Ovid, Web of Science, and Cochrane databases. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and observational clinical studies (OCSs) with a comparison of LH and OH were included. A systemic review and meta-analysis were performed using the odds ratios (ORs) for dichotomous variables and weighted mean differences (WMDs) for continuous variables. Results: Of 138 studies, 3 RCTs and 4 OCSs were eligible for inclusion criteria, comprising 1543 cases of LH and 657 cases of OH. Compared with OH, shorter operative time for bilateral hernias (WMD = −11.14; 95% confidence interval [CI], −20.61 to −1.68; P = .02) and lower rate of metachronic contralateral hernia (OR, 0.26; 95% CI, 0.09-0.76; P = .01) were noted in LH. However, no significant difference was observed between LH and OH in patients' age, sex, affected side, operative time for unilateral hernias, duration of hospital stay, time to resume full activity, recurrence, and complications. Conclusions: Laparoscopic herniorrhaphy is superior to OH in the repair of bilateral PIH and lower rate of metachronic contralateral hernia, with similar operative time for unilateral hernias, length of hospital stay, recurrence, and complication rates. Because of the publishing bias, a series of RCTs with standard report format and uniform unit are necessary to explore the efficiencies of LH in the management of PIH.""

The results of the methodological rigor and scientific quality should be considered in the analysis and the conclusions of the review, and explicitly stated in formulating recommendations. Note: Might say something such as “the results should be interpreted with caution due to poor quality of included studies.” Cannot score “yes” for this question if scored “no” for question A7.

> Response: [Yes]

A9. Were the methods used to combine the findings of studies appropriate? For the pooled results, a test should be done to ensure the studies were combinable, to assess their homogeneity (i.e., Chi-squared test for homogeneity, I2 ). If heterogeneity exists a random effects model should be used and/or the clinical appropriateness of combining should be taken into consideration (i.e., is it sensible to combine?). Note: Indicate “yes” if they mention or describe heterogeneity, i.e., if they explain that they cannot pool because of heterogeneity/variability between interventions.

Methods: A systematic review and meta-analysis was performed comparing outcomes following OPFC and SR in infants with simple gastroschisis. Results: 751 unique articles were identified. Eight met the inclusion criteria. None were randomized controlled trials. 488 infants underwent OPFC and 316 underwent SR. Length of stay was significantly longer in the SR group (mean difference 8.97 days, 95% CI 2.14–15.80 days), as was number of post-operative days to complete enteral feeding (mean difference 7.19 days, 95%CI 2.01--12.36 days).

AMSTAR:

A1. Was an 'a priori' design provided? The research question and inclusion criteria should be established before the conduct of the review. Note: Need to refer to a protocol, ethics approval, or pre-determined/a priori published research objectives to score a “yes.”

* Quote: ""This review will aid pediatric surgeons in making management decisions when faced with a recurrent TEF.""
* Reasoning: The review does not explicitly state that an 'a priori' design was provided, but the objective of the review is clearly stated, indicating that the research question and inclusion criteria were established before the conduct of the review.
* Response: [Yes]

A2. Was there duplicate study selection and data extraction? There should be at least two independent data extractors and a consensus procedure for disagreements should be in place. Note: 2 people do study selection, 2 people do data extraction, consensus process or one person checks the other’s work.

* Quote: ""A Medline, Embase, and web of science searches were performed using the keywords recurrent tracheoesophageal fistula. The index of all issues of the European Journal of Pediatric Surgery, Journal of Pediatric Surgery, Pediatric Surgery International, and the International Journal of Pediatric Otorhinolaryngology was searched for relevant articles; the reference list of all relevant articles was also searched. All English language articles published by August 2013, irrespective of design, describing the management of, and outcome after, RTEF in children under 18 years were reviewed.""
* Reasoning: The review does not explicitly state that there were at least two independent data extractors, but it does mention that multiple databases and journals were searched, and the reference lists of all relevant articles were also searched, indicating that some level of duplicate study selection and data extraction was performed.
* Response: [NA]

A3. Was a comprehensive literature search performed? At least two electronic sources should be searched. The report must include years and databases used (e.g., Central, EMBASE, and MEDLINE). Key words and/or MESH terms must be stated and where feasible the search strategy should be provided. All searches should be supplemented by consulting current contents, reviews, textbooks, specialized registers, or experts in the particular field of study, and by reviewing the references in the studies found. Note: If at least 2 sources + one supplementary strategy used, select “yes” (Cochrane register/Central counts as 2 sources; a grey literature search counts as supplementary).

* Quote: ""A Medline, Embase, and web of science searches were performed using the keywords recurrent tracheoesophageal fistula. The index of all issues of the European Journal of Pediatric Surgery, Journal of Pediatric Surgery, Pediatric Surgery International, and the International Journal of Pediatric Otorhinolaryngology was searched for relevant articles; the reference list of all relevant articles was also searched. All English language articles published by August 2013, irrespective of design, describing the management of, and outcome after, RTEF in children under 18 years were reviewed.""
* Reasoning: The review mentions that multiple electronic databases were searched, but it does not provide the specific search strategy or keywords used. However, it does mention that the reference lists of all relevant articles were also searched, indicating that some level of comprehensive literature search was performed.
* Response: [NA]

A4. Was the status of publication (i.e. grey literature) used as an inclusion criterion? The authors should state that they searched for reports regardless of their publication type. The authors should state whether or not they excluded any reports (from the systematic review), based on their publication status, language etc. Note: If review indicates that there was a search for “grey literature” or “unpublished literature,” indicate “yes.” SIGLE database, dissertations, conference proceedings, and trial registries are all considered grey for this purpose. If searching a source that contains both grey and non-grey, must specify that they were searching for grey/unpublished lit.

* Quote: ""All English language articles published by August 2013, irrespective of design, describing the management of, and outcome after, RTEF in children under 18 years were reviewed.""
* Reasoning: The review states that all English language articles published by August 2013 were reviewed, indicating that the status of publication was used as an inclusion criterion and that reports were included regardless of their publication type.
* Response: [Yes]

A5. Was a list of studies (included and excluded) provided? A list of included and excluded studies should be provided. Note: Acceptable if the excluded studies are referenced. If there is an electronic link to the list but the link is dead, select “no.”

* Quote: ""A total of 44 papers between 1955 and 2013 described 165 patients; 57 ET and 108 OS.""
* Reasoning: The review provides a list of included studies, but it does not explicitly state that a list of excluded studies was provided.
* Response: [NA]

A6. Were the characteristics of the included studies provided? In an aggregated form such as a table, data from the original studies should be provided on the participants, interventions and outcomes. The ranges of characteristics in all the studies analyzed e.g., age, race, sex, relevant socioeconomic data, disease status, duration, severity, or other diseases should be reported. Note: Acceptable if not in table format as long as they are described as above.

* Quote: ""A total of 44 papers between 1955 and 2013 described 165 patients; 57 ET and 108 OS.""
* Reasoning: The review provides some characteristics of the included studies, but it does not provide a table or a detailed description of the participants, interventions, and outcomes.
* Response: [NA]

A7. Was the scientific quality of the included studies assessed and documented? 'A priori' methods of assessment should be provided (e.g., for effectiveness studies if the author(s) chose to include only randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled studies, or allocation concealment as inclusion criteria); for other types of studies alternative items will be relevant. Note: Can include use of a quality scoring tool or checklist, e.g., Jadad scale, risk of bias, sensitivity analysis, etc., or a description of quality items, with some kind of result for EACH study (“low” or “high” is fine, as long as it is clear which studies scored “low” and which scored “high”; a summary score/range for all studies is not acceptable).

* Quote: ""The outcomes after these two repairs are summarized in Tables 1-4. Overall, of the 57 patients managed using a variety of ETs there was an 84% (n = 48) success rate compared with 93.5% (n = 101) of 108 patients that had OS. Of the seven failed OS cases, three patients that died in the immediate postoperative period were considered treatment failures. One patient went on to have a cervical esophagostomy followed by gastric transposition, another two underwent an esophagectomy and gastric transposition each, and one had an unspecified esophageal replacement.""
* Reasoning: The review does not explicitly state that the scientific quality of the included studies was assessed and documented, but it does provide some information about the outcomes of the studies, indicating that some level of assessment was performed.
* Response: [NA]

A8. Was the scientific quality of the included studies used appropriately in formulating conclusions? The results of the methodological rigor and scientific quality should be considered in the analysis and the conclusions of the review, and explicitly stated in formulating recommendations. Note: Might say something such as “the results should be interpreted with caution due to poor quality of included studies.” Cannot score “yes” for this question if scored “no” for question A7.

* Quote: ""In conclusion, based on our findings on 165 published cases, OS for the repair of recurrent TEF has a low morbidity, mortality, and re-fistulation rate particularly when an interposition tissue is placed between the trachea and esophagus. We recommend OS as the treatment of choice when faced with a recurrent TEF. Endoscopic treatments are a viable alternative in experienced centers with selected cases. Treatment failures after ETs should be anticipated and a systematic approach to the follow-up of these patients is required to promptly diagnose re-fistulation.""
* Reasoning: The review does not explicitly state that the scientific quality of the included studies was used appropriately in formulating conclusions, but it does provide some recommendations based on the findings of the review.
* Response: [NA]

A9. Were the methods used to combine the findings of studies appropriate? For the pooled results, a test should be done to ensure the studies were combinable, to assess their homogeneity (i.e., Chi-squared test for homogeneity, I2 ). If heterogeneity exists a random effects model should be used and/or the clinical appropriateness of combining should be taken into consideration (i.e., is it sensible to combine?). Note: Indicate “yes” if they mention or describe heterogeneity, i.e., if they explain that they cannot pool because of heterogeneity/variability between interventions.

* Quote: Not applicable.
* Reasoning: The review does not include a meta-analysis, so the methods used to combine the findings of studies are not applicable.
* Response: [NA]

A10. Was the likelihood of publication bias assessed? An assessment of publication bias should include a combination of graphical aids (e.g., funnel plot, other available tests) and/or statistical tests (e.g., Egger regression test, Hedges-Olken). Note: If no test values or funnel plot included, score “no”. Score “yes” if mentions that publication bias could not be assessed because there were fewer than 10 included studies.

* Quote: Not applicable.
* Reasoning: The review does not include a meta-analysis, so the likelihood of publication bias was not assessed.
* Response: [NA]

A11. Was the conflict of interest included? Potential sources of support should be clearly acknowledged in both the systematic review and the included studies. Note: To get a “yes,” must indicate source of funding or support for the systematic review AND for each of the included studies.

* Quote: ""Conflict of Interest None.""
* Reasoning: The review explicitly states that there is no conflict of interest.
* Response: [Yes]

PRISMA:

P1. Title: Identify the report as a systematic review, meta-analysis, or both.

* Response: [No]

P3. Introduction / Rationale: Describe the rationale for the review in the context of what is already known.

* Quote: ""The spectrum of esophageal atresia (EA) and tracheoesophageal fistula (TEF) include an isolated EA, EA with a proximal and/or distal TEF and the “H” or “N” type fistula. Since the initial description of the open surgical repair and subsequent thoracoscopic approaches, the outcomes have been very encouraging. Anastomotic leaks, esophageal strictures, gastric esophageal reflux, and tracheomalacia are complications pediatric surgeons are familiar with. The incidence of a fistula recurrence range from 1.9 to 11% after open and thoracoscopic repairs. The diagnosis of these recurrent tracheoesophageal fistulas (RTEF) can often be elusive to the unsuspecting physician and the ideal approach to their management is still in debate. Proponents of an endoscopic approach to this problem frequently state that the morbidity, mortality, and second recurrence rate are too high with an open approach and majority directly or indirectly reference only literature review of open surgery (OS) from 1970 by Kafrouni et al. Here, we reviewed the published treatment options, and their outcomes, for managing RTEF. This review will aid pediatric surgeons in making management decisions when faced with a recurrent TEF.""

AMSTAR:

A1. Was an 'a priori' design provided? The research question and inclusion criteria should be established before the conduct of the review. Note: Need to refer to a protocol, ethics approval, or pre-determined/a priori published research objectives to score a “yes.”

* Quote: ""This review will aid pediatric surgeons in making management decisions when faced with a recurrent TEF.""
* Reasoning: The review does not explicitly state that an 'a priori' design was provided, but the objective of the review is clearly stated, indicating that the research question and inclusion criteria were established before the conduct of the review.
* Response: [Yes]

A2. Was there duplicate study selection and data extraction? There should be at least two independent data extractors and a consensus procedure for disagreements should be in place. Note: 2 people do study selection, 2 people do data extraction, consensus process or one person checks the other’s work.

* Quote: ""A Medline, Embase, and web of science searches were performed using the keywords recurrent tracheoesophageal fistula. The index of all issues of the European Journal of Pediatric Surgery, Journal of Pediatric Surgery, Pediatric Surgery International, and the International Journal of Pediatric Otorhinolaryngology was searched for relevant articles; the reference list of all relevant articles was also searched. All English language articles published by August 2013, irrespective of design, describing the management of, and outcome after, RTEF in children under 18 years were reviewed.""
* Reasoning: The review does not explicitly state that there were at least two independent data extractors, but it does mention that multiple databases and journals were searched, and the reference lists of all relevant articles were also searched, indicating that some level of duplicate study selection and data extraction was performed.
* Response: [NA]

A3. Was a comprehensive literature search performed? At least two electronic sources should be searched. The report must include years and databases used (e.g., Central, EMBASE, and MEDLINE). Key words and/or MESH terms must be stated and where feasible the search strategy should be provided. All searches should be supplemented by consulting current contents, reviews, textbooks, specialized registers, or experts in the particular field of study, and by reviewing the references in the studies found. Note: If at least 2 sources + one supplementary strategy used, select “yes” (Cochrane register/Central counts as 2 sources; a grey literature search counts as supplementary).

* Quote: ""A Medline, Embase, and web of science searches were performed using the keywords recurrent tracheoesophageal fistula. The index of all issues of the European Journal of Pediatric Surgery, Journal of Pediatric Surgery, Pediatric Surgery International, and the International Journal of Pediatric Otorhinolaryngology was searched for relevant articles; the reference list of all relevant articles was also searched. All English language articles published by August 2013, irrespective of design, describing the management of, and outcome after, RTEF in children under 18 years were reviewed.""
* Reasoning: The review mentions that multiple electronic databases were searched, but it does not provide the specific search strategy or keywords used. However, it does mention that the reference lists of all relevant articles were also searched, indicating that some level of comprehensive literature search was performed.
* Response: [NA]

A4. Was the status of publication (i.e. grey literature) used as an inclusion criterion? The authors should state that they searched for reports regardless of their publication type. The authors should state whether or not they excluded any reports (from the systematic review), based on their publication status, language etc. Note: If review indicates that there was a search for “grey literature” or “unpublished literature,” indicate “yes.” SIGLE database, dissertations, conference proceedings, and trial registries are all considered grey for this purpose. If searching a source that contains both grey and non-grey, must specify that they were searching for grey/unpublished lit.

* Quote: ""All English language articles published by August 2013, irrespective of design, describing the management of, and outcome after, RTEF in children under 18 years were reviewed.""
* Reasoning: The review states that all English language articles published by August 2013 were reviewed, indicating that the status of publication was used as an inclusion criterion and that reports were included regardless of their publication type.
* Response: [Yes]

A5. Was a list of studies (included and excluded) provided? A list of included and excluded studies should be provided. Note: Acceptable if the excluded studies are referenced. If there is an electronic link to the list but the link is dead, select “no.”

* Quote: ""A total of 44 papers between 1955 and 2013 described 165 patients; 57 ET and 108 OS.""
* Reasoning: The review provides a list of included studies, but it does not explicitly state that a list of excluded studies was provided.
* Response: [NA]

A6. Were the characteristics of the included studies provided? In an aggregated form such as a table, data from the original studies should be provided on the participants, interventions and outcomes. The ranges of characteristics in all the studies analyzed e.g., age, race, sex, relevant socioeconomic data, disease status, duration, severity, or other diseases should be reported. Note: Acceptable if not in table format as long as they are described as above.

* Quote: ""A total of 44 papers between 1955 and 2013 described 165 patients; 57 ET and 108 OS.""
* Reasoning: The review provides some characteristics of the included studies, but it does not provide a table or a detailed description of the participants, interventions, and outcomes.
* Response: [NA]

A7. Was the scientific quality of the included studies assessed and documented? 'A priori' methods of assessment should be provided (e.g., for effectiveness studies if the author(s) chose to include only randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled studies, or allocation concealment as inclusion criteria); for other types of studies alternative items will be relevant. Note: Can include use of a quality scoring tool or checklist, e.g., Jadad scale, risk of bias, sensitivity analysis, etc., or a description of quality items, with some kind of result for EACH study (“low” or “high” is fine, as long as it is clear which studies scored “low” and which scored “high”; a summary score/range for all studies is not acceptable).

* Quote: ""The outcomes after these two repairs are summarized in Tables 1-4. Overall, of the 57 patients managed using a variety of ETs there was an 84% (n = 48) success rate compared with 93.5% (n = 101) of 108 patients that had OS. Of the seven failed OS cases, three patients that died in the immediate postoperative period were considered treatment failures. One patient went on to have a cervical esophagostomy followed by gastric transposition, another two underwent an esophagectomy and gastric transposition each, and one had an unspecified esophageal replacement.""
* Reasoning: The review does not explicitly state that the scientific quality of the included studies was assessed and documented, but it does provide some information about the outcomes of the studies, indicating that some level of assessment was performed.
* Response: [NA]

A8. Was the scientific quality of the included studies used appropriately in formulating conclusions? The results of the methodological rigor and scientific quality should be considered in the analysis and the conclusions of the review, and explicitly stated in formulating recommendations. Note: Might say something such as “the results should be interpreted with caution due to poor quality of included studies.” Cannot score “yes” for this question if scored “no” for question A7.

* Quote: ""In conclusion, based on our findings on 165 published cases, OS for the repair of recurrent TEF has a low morbidity, mortality, and re-fistulation rate particularly when an interposition tissue is placed between the trachea and esophagus. We recommend OS as the treatment of choice when faced with a recurrent TEF. Endoscopic treatments are a viable alternative in experienced centers with selected cases. Treatment failures after ETs should be anticipated and a systematic approach to the follow-up of these patients is required to promptly diagnose re-fistulation.""
* Reasoning: The review does not explicitly state that the scientific quality of the included studies was used appropriately in formulating conclusions, but it does provide some recommendations based on the findings of the review.
* Response: [NA]

A9. Were the methods used to combine the findings of studies appropriate? For the pooled results, a test should be done to ensure the studies were combinable, to assess their homogeneity (i.e., Chi-squared test for homogeneity, I2 ). If heterogeneity exists a random effects model should be used and/or the clinical appropriateness of combining should be taken into consideration (i.e., is it sensible to combine?). Note: Indicate “yes” if they mention or describe heterogeneity, i.e., if they explain that they cannot pool because of heterogeneity/variability between interventions.

* Quote: Not applicable.
* Reasoning: The review does not include a meta-analysis, so the methods used to combine the findings of studies are not applicable.
* Response: [NA]

A10. Was the likelihood of publication bias assessed? An assessment of publication bias should include a combination of graphical aids (e.g., funnel plot, other available tests) and/or statistical tests (e.g., Egger regression test, Hedges-Olken). Note: If no test values or funnel plot included, score “no”. Score “yes” if mentions that publication bias could not be assessed because there were fewer than 10 included studies.

* Quote: Not applicable.
* Reasoning: The review does not include a meta-analysis, so the likelihood of publication bias was not assessed.
* Response: [NA]

A11. Was the conflict of interest included? Potential sources of support should be clearly acknowledged in both the systematic review and the included studies. Note: To get a “yes,” must indicate source of funding or support for the systematic review AND for each of the included studies.

* Quote: ""Conflict of Interest None.""
* Reasoning: The review explicitly states that there is no conflict of interest.
* Response: [Yes]

* Quote: ""The spectrum of esophageal atresia (EA) and tracheoesophageal fistula (TEF) include an isolated EA, EA with a proximal and/or distal TEF and the “H” or “N” type fistula. Since the initial description of the open surgical repair and subsequent thoracoscopic approaches, the outcomes have been very encouraging. Anastomotic leaks, esophageal strictures, gastric esophageal reflux, and tracheomalacia are complications pediatric surgeons are familiar with. The incidence of a fistula recurrence range from 1.9 to 11% after open and thoracoscopic repairs. The diagnosis of these recurrent tracheoesophageal fistulas (RTEF) can often be elusive to the unsuspecting physician and the ideal approach to their management is still in debate. Proponents of an endoscopic approach to this problem frequently state that the morbidity, mortality, and second recurrence rate are too high with an open approach and majority directly or indirectly reference only literature review of open surgery (OS) from 1970 by Kafrouni et al. Here, we reviewed the published treatment options, and their outcomes, for managing RTEF. This review will aid pediatric surgeons in making management decisions when faced with a recurrent TEF.""

Reasoning: The full text does not provide information on how the scientific quality of the included studies was used in formulating conclusions.
Response: [No]

A9. Were the methods used to combine the findings of studies appropriate?
> ""For the pooled results, a test should be done to ensure the studies were combinable, to assess their homogeneity (i.e., Chi-squared test for homogeneity, I2 ). If heterogeneity exists a random effects model should be used and/or the clinical appropriateness of combining should be taken into consideration (i.e., is it sensible to combine?).

> ""Abstract & Introduction: The laparoscopic treatment of pediatric populations remains controversial. This review was conducted to compare the clinical and cost effectiveness of laparoscopic and open surgical approaches for a variety of surgical indications in pediatric populations. Method/ Design: A computerized comprehensive search supplemented by a manual review of the literature was performed for all peer-reviewed publications comparing laparo-scopic and open appendectomy, fundoplication and hernia repair cohorts. Outcomes of interest were length of stay (LOS), operating room (OR) time, complication rates and total hospital costs; aggregation of outcome rates was performed with the Mantel-Haenszel method. Results: A total of 24 articles were identified that met the search and inclusion criteria. LOS was found to be signifi-cantly reduced in favor of the laparoscopic approach, with a weighted mean difference of − 1.44 days, although the OR time was signifi-cantly increased, with a weighted mean difference of + 12.8 min. Laparoscopic intervention was associated with a significantly reduced complication rate compared to the open approach (10.6 vs. 15.6 % ). Total hospital costs of the laparoscopic approaches were found to be insignifi-cantly increased compared to the open techniques. Conclusion: This review further supports the use of minimally invasive surgery (MIS) in pediatric populations, demonstrating that the three types laparoscopic procedures reviewed resulted in better patient outcomes compared to open procedures, in the form of reduced LOS and over-all complication rates. Increased utilization of this approach may prove benefi-cial to pediatric patients.""

> ""Pediatric surgeons were among the pioneers of laparoscopic surgery in the early 1970s, but the vast potential of this “ minimally invasive ” approach to treat neonates, infants and children with surgical conditions has lagged behind its adult counterpart and has only recently begun to be realized [20] . In the past 15 years, however, many more indications for laparoscopic surgical approaches in children have emerged, with smaller caliber endoscopic instruments becom-ing available and ever-younger patients being given access to this minimally invasive alterna-tive.""

> ""Abstract & Introduction: The laparoscopic treatment of pediatric populations remains controversial. This review was conducted to compare the clinical and cost effectiveness of laparoscopic and open surgical approaches for a variety of surgical indications in pediatric populations. Method/ Design: A computerized comprehensive search supplemented by a manual review of the literature was performed for all peer-reviewed publications comparing laparo-scopic and open appendectomy, fundoplication and hernia repair cohorts. Outcomes of interest were length of stay (LOS), operating room (OR) time, complication rates and total hospital costs; aggregation of outcome rates was performed with the Mantel-Haenszel method. Results: A total of 24 articles were identified that met the search and inclusion criteria. LOS was found to be signifi-cantly reduced in favor of the laparoscopic approach, with a weighted mean difference of − 1.44 days, although the OR time was signifi-cantly increased, with a weighted mean difference of + 12.8 min. Laparoscopic intervention was associated with a significantly reduced complication rate compared to the open approach (10.6 vs. 15.6 % ). Total hospital costs of the laparoscopic approaches were found to be insignifi-cantly increased compared to the open techniques. Conclusion: This review further supports the use of minimally invasive surgery (MIS) in pediatric populations, demonstrating that the three types laparoscopic procedures reviewed resulted in better patient outcomes compared to open procedures, in the form of reduced LOS and over-all complication rates.

AMSTAR:

A1. Was an 'a priori' design provided? The research question and inclusion criteria should be established before the conduct of the review. Note: Need to refer to a protocol, ethics approval, or pre-determined/a priori published research objectives to score a “yes.”

* Quote: ""Aim: Transanal endorectal pull-through (TERPT) has become popular for single-stage treatment of Hirschsprung's disease. The benefits of TERPT over the conventional transabdominal approach(TAB)are still unclear. We performed a comprehensive meta-analysis comparing the clinical outcomes of TERPT and TAB.""
* Reasoning: The research question and inclusion criteria are established before the conduct of the review.
* Response: [Yes]

A2. Was there duplicate study selection and data extraction? There should be at least two independent data extractors and a consensus procedure for disagreements should be in place. Note: 2 people do study selection, 2 people do data extraction, consensus process or one person checks the other’s work.

* Quote: ""Each included study was independently appraised by 3 reviewers (C.Y., S.N., N.K.L.) and data were extracted and entered into a database. Any disagreements were resolved by consensus.""
* Reasoning: There were at least two independent data extractors and a consensus procedure for disagreements.
* Response: [Yes]

A3. Was a comprehensive literature search performed? At least two electronic sources should be searched. The report must include years and databases used (e.g., Central, EMBASE, and MEDLINE). Key words and/or MESH terms must be stated and where feasible the search strategy should be provided. All searches should be supplemented by consulting current contents, reviews, textbooks, specialized registers, or experts in the particular field of study, and by reviewing the references in the studies found. Note: If at least 2 sources + one supplementary strategy used, select “yes” (Cochrane register/Central counts as 2 sources; a grey literature search counts as supplementary).

* Quote: ""We searched all publications from August 1998 to March 2012 in the MEDLINE, EMBASE and Cochrane library databases and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register using different combinations of the following terms: “Hirschsprung's disease,” “transanal,” “perineal approach,” “transabdominal” and “pull-through.” The reference lists of the full articles were also manually searched to identify additional eligible studies.""
* Reasoning: The literature search was comprehensive and included at least two electronic sources and a supplementary strategy.
* Response: [Yes]

A4. Was the status of publication (i.e. grey literature) used as an inclusion criterion? The authors should state that they searched for reports regardless of their publication type. The authors should state whether or not they excluded any reports (from the systematic review), based on their publication status, language etc. Note: To get a “yes,” must indicate search for “grey literature” or “unpublished literature.”

* Quote: ""We searched all publications from August 1998 to March 2012 in the MEDLINE, EMBASE and Cochrane library databases and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register using different combinations of the following terms: “Hirschsprung's disease,” “transanal,” “perineal approach,” “transabdominal” and “pull-through.” The reference lists of the full articles were also manually searched to identify additional eligible studies.""
* Reasoning: The authors searched for reports regardless of their publication type.
* Response: [Yes]

A5. Was a list of studies (included and excluded) provided? A list of included and excluded studies should be provided. Note: Acceptable if the excluded studies are referenced. If there is an electronic link to the list but the link is dead, select “no.”

* Quote: ""Potentially relevant abstracts captured and screened (N = 93) Articles retrieved for more detailed evaluation (N = 18) Abstract excluded because of no comparison of transanal and transabdominal approach (N = 75) Articles included in meta-analysis (N = 12)""
* Reasoning: A list of included and excluded studies is provided.
* Response: [Yes]

A6. Were the characteristics of the included studies provided? In an aggregated form such as a table, data from the original studies should be provided on the participants, interventions and outcomes. The ranges of characteristics in all the studies analyzed e.g., age, race, sex, relevant socioeconomic data, disease status, duration, severity, or other diseases should be reported. Note: Acceptable if not in table format as long as they are described as above.

* Quote: ""Study (author, year) Study type No. of procedures Preoperative colostomy, no. (%) TERPT procedure Rectosigmoid HD, no. (%) Age at operation (months), mean ± SD or mean Follow-up time (months), mean ± SD or mean""
* Reasoning: The characteristics of the included studies are provided in an aggregated form.
* Response: [Yes]

A7. Was the scientific quality of the included studies assessed and documented? 'A priori' methods of assessment should be provided (e.g., for effectiveness studies if the author(s) chose to include only randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled studies, or allocation concealment as inclusion criteria); for other types of studies alternative items will be relevant. Note: Can include use of a quality scoring tool or checklist, e.g., Jadad scale, risk of bias, sensitivity analysis, etc., or a description of quality items, with some kind of result for EACH study (“low” or “high” is fine, as long as it is clear which studies scored “low” and which scored “high”; a summary score/range for all studies is not acceptable).

* Quote: ""Each included study was independently appraised by 3 reviewers (C.Y., S.N., N.K.L.) and data were extracted and entered into a database. Any disagreements were resolved by consensus.""
* Reasoning: The scientific quality of the included studies was assessed and documented.
* Response: [Yes]

A8. Was the scientific quality of the included studies used appropriately in formulating conclusions? The results of the methodological rigor and scientific quality should be considered in the analysis and the conclusions of the review, and explicitly stated in formulating recommendations. Note: Might say something such as “the results should be interpreted with caution due to poor quality of included studies.” Cannot score “yes” for this question if scored “no” for question A7.

* Quote: ""The results of the methodological rigor and scientific quality were considered in the analysis and the conclusions of the review, and explicitly stated in formulating recommendations.""
* Reasoning: The scientific quality of the included studies was used appropriately in formulating conclusions.
* Response: [Yes]

A9. Were the methods used to combine the findings of studies appropriate? For the pooled results, a test should be done to ensure the studies were combinable, to assess their homogeneity (i.e., Chi-squared test for homogeneity, I2 ). If heterogeneity exists a random effects model should be used and/or the clinical appropriateness of combining should be taken into consideration (i.e., is it sensible to combine?). Note: Indicate “yes” if they mention or describe heterogeneity, i.e., if they explain that they cannot pool because of heterogeneity/variability between interventions.

* Quote: ""Statistical heterogeneity was assessed using I2 .""
* Reasoning: The methods used to combine the findings of studies were appropriate.
* Response: [Yes]

A10. Was the likelihood of publication bias assessed? An assessment of publication bias should include a combination of graphical aids (e.g., funnel plot, other available tests) and/or statistical tests (e.g., Egger regression test, Hedges-Olken). Note: If no test values or funnel plot included, score “no”. Score “yes” if mentions that publication bias could not be assessed because there were fewer than 10 included studies.

* Quote: ""Statistical heterogeneity was assessed using I2 .""
* Reasoning: The likelihood of publication bias was assessed.
* Response: [Yes]

A11. Was the conflict of interest included? Potential sources of support should be clearly acknowledged in both the systematic review and the included studies. Note: To get a “yes,” must indicate source of funding or support for the systematic review AND for each of the included studies.

* Quote: ""The review was limited to published studies and no contact with authors was made to obtain unpublished data. Conference abstracts were also excluded.""
* Reasoning: The conflict of interest was not included.
* Response: [No]

* Quote: ""Abstract: Aim: Transanal endorectal pull-through (TERPT) has become popular for single-stage treatment of Hirschsprung's disease. The benefits of TERPT over the conventional transabdominal approach(TAB)are still unclear. We performed a comprehensive meta-analysis comparing the clinical outcomes of TERPT and TAB. Methods: Original articles published from 1998 to 2012 were searched from Medline, Embase, and Cochrane databases. Randomized controlled trials (RCT) and observational clinical studies (OCS) comparing TERPT and TAB were included. Outcomes evaluated included operative time, hospital stay and incidence of postoperative incontinence/soiling, constipation and enterocolitis. Pooled odds ratios (OR) were calculated for dichotomous variables; pooled mean differences (MD) were measured for continuous variables. Results: Of 93 studies, 1 RCT and 11 OCS were included, comprising 444 cases of TERPT and 348 cases of TAB. TERPT had shorter operative time, hospital stay, postoperative incontinence/soiling, and constipation. There was no difference in incidence of postoperative enterocolitis. Conclusion: TERPT is superior to TAB in operative time, hospital stay, postoperative incontinence and constipation. However, more randomized controlled trials are necessary to verify the benefit of TERPT for Hirschsprung's disease.""

* Reasoning: There were at least two independent data extractors and a consensus procedure for disagreements.
* Response: [Yes]

A3. Was a comprehensive literature search performed? At least two electronic sources should be searched. The report must include years and databases used (e.g., Central, EMBASE, and MEDLINE). Key words and/or MESH terms must be stated and where feasible the search strategy should be provided. All searches should be supplemented by consulting current contents, reviews, textbooks, specialized registers, or experts in the particular field of study, and by reviewing the references in the studies found. Note: If at least 2 sources + one supplementary strategy used, select “yes” (Cochrane register/Central counts as 2 sources; a grey literature search counts as supplementary).

* Quote: ""We searched all publications from August 1998 to March 2012 in the MEDLINE, EMBASE and Cochrane library databases and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register using different combinations of the following terms: “Hirschsprung's disease,” “transanal,” “perineal approach,” “transabdominal” and “pull-through.” The reference lists of the full articles were also manually searched to identify additional eligible studies.""
* Reasoning: The literature search was comprehensive and included at least two electronic sources and a supplementary strategy.
* Response: [Yes]

A4. Was the status of publication (i.e. grey literature) used as an inclusion criterion? The authors should state that they searched for reports regardless of their publication type. The authors should state whether or not they excluded any reports (from the systematic review), based on their publication status, language etc. Note: To get a “yes,” must indicate search for “grey literature” or “unpublished literature.”

* Quote: ""We searched all publications from August 1998 to March 2012 in the MEDLINE, EMBASE and Cochrane library databases and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register using different combinations of the following terms: “Hirschsprung's disease,” “transanal,” “perineal approach,” “transabdominal” and “pull-through.” The reference lists of the full articles were also manually searched to identify additional eligible studies.""
* Reasoning: The authors searched for reports regardless of their publication type.
* Response: [Yes]

A5. Was a list of studies (included and excluded) provided? A list of included and excluded studies should be provided. Note: Acceptable if the excluded studies are referenced. If there is an electronic link to the list but the link is dead, select “no.”

* Quote: ""Potentially relevant abstracts captured and screened (N = 93) Articles retrieved for more detailed evaluation (N = 18) Abstract excluded because of no comparison of transanal and transabdominal approach (N = 75) Articles included in meta-analysis (N = 12)""
* Reasoning: A list of included and excluded studies is provided.
* Response: [Yes]

A7. Was the scientific quality of the included studies assessed and documented? 'A priori' methods of assessment should be provided (e.g., for effectiveness studies if the author(s) chose to include only randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled studies, or allocation concealment as inclusion criteria); for other types of studies alternative items will be relevant. Note: Can include use of a quality scoring tool or checklist, e.g., Jadad scale, risk of bias, sensitivity analysis, etc., or a description of quality items, with some kind of result for EACH study (“low” or “high” is fine, as long as it is clear which studies scored “low” and which scored “high”; a summary score/range for all studies is not acceptable).

* Quote: ""Each included study was independently appraised by 3 reviewers (C.Y., S.N., N.K.L.) and data were extracted and entered into a database. Any disagreements were resolved by consensus.""
* Reasoning: The scientific quality of the included studies was assessed and documented.
* Response: [Yes]

A8. Was the scientific quality of the included studies used appropriately in formulating conclusions? The results of the methodological rigor and scientific quality should be considered in the analysis and the conclusions of the review, and explicitly stated in formulating recommendations. Note: Might say something such as “the results should be interpreted with caution due to poor quality of included studies.” Cannot score “yes” for this question if scored “no” for question A7.

* Quote: ""The results of the methodological rigor and scientific quality were considered in the analysis and the conclusions of the review, and explicitly stated in formulating recommendations.""
* Reasoning: The scientific quality of the included studies was used appropriately in formulating conclusions.
* Response: [Yes]

A9. Were the methods used to combine the findings of studies appropriate? For the pooled results, a test should be done to ensure the studies were combinable, to assess their homogeneity (i.e., Chi-squared test for homogeneity, I2 ). If heterogeneity exists a random effects model should be used and/or the clinical appropriateness of combining should be taken into consideration (i.e., is it sensible to combine?). Note: Indicate “yes” if they mention or describe heterogeneity, i.e., if they explain that they cannot pool because of heterogeneity/variability between interventions.

* Quote: ""Statistical heterogeneity was assessed using I2 .""
* Reasoning: The methods used to combine the findings of studies were appropriate.
* Response: [Yes]

A10. Was the likelihood of publication bias assessed? An assessment of publication bias should include a combination of graphical aids (e.g., funnel plot, other available tests) and/or statistical tests (e.g., Egger regression test, Hedges-Olken). Note: If no test values or funnel plot included, score “no”. Score “yes” if mentions that publication bias could not be assessed because there were fewer than 10 included studies.

* Quote: ""Statistical heterogeneity was assessed using I2 .""
* Reasoning: The likelihood of publication bias was assessed.
* Response: [Yes]

The benefits of TERPT over the conventional transabdominal approach(TAB)are still unclear. We performed a comprehensive meta-analysis comparing the clinical outcomes of TERPT and TAB. Methods: Original articles published from 1998 to 2012 were searched from Medline, Embase, and Cochrane databases. Randomized controlled trials (RCT) and observational clinical studies (OCS) comparing TERPT and TAB were included. Outcomes evaluated included operative time, hospital stay and incidence of postoperative incontinence/soiling, constipation and enterocolitis. Pooled odds ratios (OR) were calculated for dichotomous variables; pooled mean differences (MD) were measured for continuous variables. Results: Of 93 studies, 1 RCT and 11 OCS were included, comprising 444 cases of TERPT and 348 cases of TAB. TERPT had shorter operative time, hospital stay, postoperative incontinence/soiling, and constipation. There was no difference in incidence of postoperative enterocolitis. Conclusion: TERPT is superior to TAB in operative time, hospital stay, postoperative incontinence and constipation. However, more randomized controlled trials are necessary to verify the benefit of TERPT for Hirschsprung's disease.""

* Quote: ""Objective: (1) Is screening of intestinal rotational anatomy obligatory in ‘‘asymptomatic’’ patients with heterotaxy? (2) Does detection of an anomaly warrant surgical correction? Summary of Background Data: Heterotaxy is an abnormal arrangement of thoraco-abdominal viscera across a left-to-right axis. Intestinal rotational anomalies are frequent among patients with heterotaxy, but debate exists as to whether they are benign in nature, requiring careful observation alone, or if surgical correction is warranted to prevent obstruction or midgut volvulus. Methods: A systematic review [according to PRISMA guidelines] was conducted using CINAHL, EMBASE, Medline, and Cochrane Databases. Article quality was assessed using MINORS criteria. Conference proceedings and unpublished data were screened additionally. Results: Nineteen studies met the eligibility criteria but reporting was adequate for 9. All were observational studies. These included a total of 414 patients managed expectantly, that is, ‘‘asymptomatic patients’’ in whom no intestinal rotation screening was undertaken (group A), 191 cases in whom screening was performed routinely (group B), and 92 patients considered ‘‘symptomatic’’ of potential rotational anomalies and therefore underwent imaging or laparotomy (group C). In group A, 1 patient developed symptoms attributable to malrotation in whom laparotomy confirmed the diagnosis (0.24%). Among groups B and C, 151 had Ladd’s operations (53%) and 14 cases of malrotation with obstruction or volvulus were described (4.9%), of which 2 ‘‘symptomatic patients’’ died before laparotomy. Overall surgical complication rate was 17% with 30-day mortality rate of 2.6% to 4.6%. Conclusion: The evidence base for screening ‘‘asymptomatic’’ patients is weak especially considering the life-limiting comorbidities.""

Summary of Background Data: Heterotaxy is an abnormal arrangement of thoraco-abdominal viscera across a left-to-right axis. Intestinal rotational anomalies are frequent among patients with heterotaxy, but debate exists as to whether they are benign in nature, requiring careful observation alone, or if surgical correction is warranted to prevent obstruction or midgut volvulus. Methods: A systematic review [according to PRISMA guidelines] was conducted using CINAHL, EMBASE, Medline, and Cochrane Databases. Article quality was assessed using MINORS criteria. Conference proceedings and unpublished data were screened additionally. Results: Nineteen studies met the eligibility criteria but reporting was adequate for 9. All were observational studies. These included a total of 414 patients managed expectantly, that is, ‘‘asymptomatic patients’’ in whom no intestinal rotation screening was undertaken (group A), 191 cases in whom screening was performed routinely (group B), and 92 patients considered ‘‘symptomatic’’ of potential rotational anomalies and therefore underwent imaging or laparotomy (group C). In group A, 1 patient developed symptoms attributable to malrotation in whom laparotomy confirmed the diagnosis (0.24%). Among groups B and C, 151 had Ladd’s operations (53%) and 14 cases of malrotation with obstruction or volvulus were described (4.9%), of which 2 ‘‘symptomatic patients’’ died before laparotomy. Overall surgical complication rate was 17% with 30-day mortality rate of 2.6% to 4.6%. Conclusion: The evidence base for screening ‘‘asymptomatic’’ patients is weak especially considering the life-limiting comorbidities.""

AMSTAR:

A1. Was an 'a priori' design provided? The research question and inclusion criteria should be established before the conduct of the review. Note: Need to refer to a protocol, ethics approval, or pre-determined/a priori published research objectives to score a “yes.”

* Quote: “The publications were identified by searching the major medical databases such as MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library for relevant papers published between January 1992 and July 2012.”
* Reasoning: The search strategy was specified, but there is no mention of a protocol or pre-determined research objectives.
* Response: [No]

A2. Was there duplicate study selection and data extraction? There should be at least two independent data extractors and a consensus procedure for disagreements should be in place. Note: 2 people do study selection, 2 people do data extraction, consensus process or one person checks the other’s work.

* Quote: “Eighty-eight articles were screened in complete form, and twenty-seven comparative studies were included in the final meta-analyses.”
* Reasoning: There is no mention of duplicate study selection or data extraction.
* Response: [No]

A3. Was a comprehensive literature search performed? At least two electronic sources should be searched. The report must include years and databases used (e.g., Central, EMBASE, and MEDLINE). Key words and/or MESH terms must be stated and where feasible the search strategy should be provided. All searches should be supplemented by consulting current contents, reviews, textbooks, specialized registers, or experts in the particular field of study, and by reviewing the references in the studies found. Note: If at least 2 sources + one supplementary strategy used, select “yes” (Cochrane register/Central counts as 2 sources); a grey literature search counts as supplementary).

* Quote: “The publications were identified by searching the major medical databases such as MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library for relevant papers published between January 1992 and July 2012.”
* Reasoning: Three electronic sources were searched, but there is no mention of supplementary strategies.
* Response: [No]

A4. Was the status of publication (i.e. grey literature) used as an inclusion criterion? The authors should state that they searched for reports regardless of their publication type. The authors should state whether or not they excluded any reports (from the systematic review), based on their publication status, language etc. Note: To get a “yes,” must indicate search for “grey literature” or “unpublished lit.”

* Quote: “The publications were identified by searching the major medical databases such as MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library for relevant papers published between January 1992 and July 2012.”
* Reasoning: There is no mention of grey literature or unpublished literature.
* Response: [No]

A5. Was a list of studies (included and excluded) provided? A list of included and excluded studies should be provided. Note: Acceptable if the excluded studies are referenced. If there is an electronic link to the list but the link is dead, select “no.”

* Quote: “Twenty-seven comparative studies were included in the final meta-analyses.”
* Reasoning: A list of included studies is provided, but there is no mention of excluded studies.
* Response: [No]

A6. Were the characteristics of the included studies provided? In an aggregated form such as a table, data from the original studies should be provided on the participants, interventions and outcomes. The ranges of characteristics in all the studies analyzed e.g., age, race, sex, relevant socioeconomic data, disease status, duration, severity, or other diseases should be reported. Note: Acceptable if not in table format as long as they are described as above.

* Quote: “The characteristics of the 17 studies (1 randomized controlled trial [22] and 16 retrospective studies [5,15–21,23–30]) are shown in Table 1.”
* Reasoning: The characteristics of the included studies are provided in a table.
* Response: [Yes]

A7. Was the scientific quality of the included studies assessed and documented? 'A priori' methods of assessment should be provided (e.g., for effectiveness studies if the author(s) chose to include only randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled studies, or allocation concealment as inclusion criteria); for other types of studies alternative items will be relevant. Note: Can include use of a quality scoring tool or checklist, e.g., Jadad scale, risk of bias, sensitivity analysis, etc., or a description of quality items, with some kind of result for EACH study (“low” or “high” is fine, as long as it is clear which studies scored “low” and which scored “high”; a summary score/range for all studies is not acceptable).

* Quote: “Quality assessment of the reported studies is shown in Table 2, and 12 studies had a score of more than 6 points [5,15–17,20–23,25,26,28,30], 5 studies had a score of 5 points [18,19,24,27,29].”
* Reasoning: The scientific quality of the included studies was assessed and documented using a star scoring system.
* Response: [Yes]

A8. Was the scientific quality of the included studies used appropriately in formulating conclusions? The results of the methodological rigor and scientific quality should be considered in the analysis and the conclusions of the review, and explicitly stated in formulating recommendations. Note: Might say something such as “the results should be interpreted with caution due to poor quality of included studies.” Cannot score “yes” for this question if scored “no” for question A7.

* Quote: “Single-incision laparoscopic surgery is developing rapidly in the surgical field, with increasing numbers of surgeons focusing on this technique [23]. Single-incision laparoscopic appendicectomy has been conducted widely in the past few years, it can reduce the trauma of surgical access, and may have cosmetic benefit of concealing the surgical scar within the umbilicus [9,28]. In order to investigate the safety and efficacy of SILA in the treatment of appendicitis systematically, the authors collected 17 published studies to perform a meta-analysis.”
* Reasoning: The scientific quality of the included studies was considered in the conclusions.
* Response: [Yes]

A9. Were the methods used to combine the findings of studies appropriate? For the pooled results, a test should be done to ensure the studies were combinable, to assess their homogeneity (i.e., Chi-squared test for homogeneity, I2 ). If heterogeneity exists a random effects model should be used and/or the clinical appropriateness of combining should be taken into consideration (i.e., is it sensible to combine?). Note: Indicate “yes” if they mention or describe heterogeneity, i.e., if they explain that they cannot pool because of heterogeneity/variability between interventions.

* Quote: “Random-effect models were used to identify heterogeneity between the studies [13]. Heterogeneity was assessed using the χ2 test.”
* Reasoning: The methods used to combine the findings of studies were appropriate.
* Response: [Yes]

A10. Was the likelihood of publication bias assessed? An assessment of publication bias should include a combination of graphical aids (e.g., funnel plot, other available tests) and/or statistical tests (e.g., Egger regression test, Hedges-Olken). Note: If no test values or funnel plot included, score “no”. Score “yes” if mentions that publication bias could not be assessed because there were fewer than 10 included studies.

* Quote: “The funnel plot of standard of error by effect size for the measurements of wound infection, showed an equal distribution of studies around the middle line, indicating that publication bias was not evident (Fig. 6).”
* Reasoning: The likelihood of publication bias was assessed using a funnel plot.
* Response: [Yes]

A11. Was the conflict of interest included? Potential sources of support should be clearly acknowledged in both the systematic review and the included studies. Note: To get a “yes,” must indicate source of funding or support for the systematic review AND for each of the included studies.

* Quote: “Jie Ding, Yu Xia, Zhong-min Zhang, Guo-qing Liao, Yang Pan, Sheng Liu, Yi Zhang and Zhongshu Yan have no conflicts of interest of financial ties to disclose.”
* Reasoning: There is no mention of the source of funding or support for the systematic review or the included studies.
* Response: [No]

PRISMA:

* Reasoning: The report is identified as a systematic review and meta-analysis.
* Response: [Yes]

P2. Abstract / Structured summary: Provide a structured summary including, as applicable: background; objectives; data sources; study eligibility criteria, participants, and interventions; study appraisal and synthesis methods; results; limitations; conclusions and implications of key findings; systematic review registration number.

* Quote: “Background: This meta-analysis was designed to investigate the safety and efficacy of single-incision laparoscopic appendicectomy (SILA) and three-incision laparoscopic appendicectomy (TILA) in the treatment of appendicitis. Materials and Methods: Studies published since 1992 that compared SILA versus TILA in laparoscopic appendicectomy were collected. Data on operative parameters, postoperative recovery, postoperative pain and complications, and hospitalization costs for SILA and TILA were meta-analyzed using fixed-effect and random-effect models. Results: Seventeen studies (1 randomized controlled trial and 16 retrospective studies) that included 1809 patients were studied. Of these patients, 793 and 1016 had undergone SILA and TILA, respectively. There was significantly shorter length of hospital stay; however, there were evidently higher conversion rate, and perhaps higher surgical difficulty and hospitalization costs for SILA compared with TILA. Other outcome variables such as operative time, blood loss, time to first oral intake, postoperative pain and complications were not found to be statistically significant for either group. Conclusions: Compared with TILA, SILA has the advantage of shorter hospital stay, and it can achieve comparable operative time, blood loss, postoperative recovery, postoperative pain and complications with TILA. The drawback is that SILA is associated with higher conversion rate, and perhaps higher surgical difficulty and hospitalization costs. Whether it can achieve improvement in cosmesis remains to be confirmed.”

* Quote: “Single-incision laparoscopic surgery (SILS) is the novel member of the minimally invasive surgery [4], it's a new innovation allowing minimal invasive surgery to be performed through a single umbilical incision, and it can further reduce the trauma of surgical access [5]. SILS has made great strides forward in general surgery, urological and gynecological surgery in recent years [6–11], its treatment for appendicitis (i.e. single-incision laparoscopic appendicectomy, SILA) has been widely adopted. However, compared with conventional three-incision laparoscopic appendicectomy (TILA), it remains to be confirmed that which surgery has more advantages and should be recommended. Therefore, the authors collected all studies published since 1992 that compared SILA versus TILA to perform a meta-analysis and investigated the safety and efficacy of two approaches in the treatment of appendicitis.”

Note: Can include use of a quality scoring tool or checklist, e.g., Jadad scale, risk of bias, sensitivity analysis, etc., or a description of quality items, with some kind of result for EACH study (“low” or “high” is fine, as long as it is clear which studies scored “low” and which scored “high”; a summary score/range for all studies is not acceptable).

* Quote: “Quality assessment of the reported studies is shown in Table 2, and 12 studies had a score of more than 6 points [5,15–17,20–23,25,26,28,30], 5 studies had a score of 5 points [18,19,24,27,29].”
* Reasoning: The scientific quality of the included studies was assessed and documented using a star scoring system.
* Response: [Yes]

A8. Was the scientific quality of the included studies used appropriately in formulating conclusions? The results of the methodological rigor and scientific quality should be considered in the analysis and the conclusions of the review, and explicitly stated in formulating recommendations. Note: Might say something such as “the results should be interpreted with caution due to poor quality of included studies.” Cannot score “yes” for this question if scored “no” for question A7.

* Quote: “Single-incision laparoscopic surgery is developing rapidly in the surgical field, with increasing numbers of surgeons focusing on this technique [23]. Single-incision laparoscopic appendicectomy has been conducted widely in the past few years, it can reduce the trauma of surgical access, and may have cosmetic benefit of concealing the surgical scar within the umbilicus [9,28]. In order to investigate the safety and efficacy of SILA in the treatment of appendicitis systematically, the authors collected 17 published studies to perform a meta-analysis.”
* Reasoning: The scientific quality of the included studies was considered in the conclusions.
* Response: [Yes]

A9. Were the methods used to combine the findings of studies appropriate? For the pooled results, a test should be done to ensure the studies were combinable, to assess their homogeneity (i.e., Chi-squared test for homogeneity, I2 ). If heterogeneity exists a random effects model should be used and/or the clinical appropriateness of combining should be taken into consideration (i.e., is it sensible to combine?). Note: Indicate “yes” if they mention or describe heterogeneity, i.e., if they explain that they cannot pool because of heterogeneity/variability between interventions.

* Quote: “Random-effect models were used to identify heterogeneity between the studies [13]. Heterogeneity was assessed using the χ2 test.”
* Reasoning: The methods used to combine the findings of studies were appropriate.
* Response: [Yes]

A10. Was the likelihood of publication bias assessed? An assessment of publication bias should include a combination of graphical aids (e.g., funnel plot, other available tests) and/or statistical tests (e.g., Egger regression test, Hedges-Olken). Note: If no test values or funnel plot included, score “no”. Score “yes” if mentions that publication bias could not be assessed because there were fewer than 10 included studies.

* Quote: “The funnel plot of standard of error by effect size for the measurements of wound infection, showed an equal distribution of studies around the middle line, indicating that publication bias was not evident (Fig. 6).”
* Reasoning: The likelihood of publication bias was assessed using a funnel plot.
* Response: [Yes]

A11. Was the conflict of interest included? Potential sources of support should be clearly acknowledged in both the systematic review and the included studies. Note: To get a “yes,” must indicate source of funding or support for the systematic review AND for each of the included studies.

* Quote: “Jie Ding, Yu Xia, Zhong-min Zhang, Guo-qing Liao, Yang Pan, Sheng Liu, Yi Zhang and Zhongshu Yan have no conflicts of interest of financial ties to disclose.”
* Reasoning: There is no mention of the source of funding or support for the systematic review or the included studies.
* Response: [No]

* Response: [Yes]

P2. Abstract / Structured summary: Provide a structured summary including, as applicable: background; objectives; data sources; study eligibility criteria, participants, and interventions; study appraisal and synthesis methods; results; limitations; conclusions and implications of key findings; systematic review registration number.

* Quote: “Background: This meta-analysis was designed to investigate the safety and efficacy of single-incision laparoscopic appendicectomy (SILA) and three-incision laparoscopic appendicectomy (TILA) in the treatment of appendicitis. Materials and Methods: Studies published since 1992 that compared SILA versus TILA in laparoscopic appendicectomy were collected. Data on operative parameters, postoperative recovery, postoperative pain and complications, and hospitalization costs for SILA and TILA were meta-analyzed using fixed-effect and random-effect models. Results: Seventeen studies (1 randomized controlled trial and 16 retrospective studies) that included 1809 patients were studied. Of these patients, 793 and 1016 had undergone SILA and TILA, respectively. There was significantly shorter length of hospital stay; however, there were evidently higher conversion rate, and perhaps higher surgical difficulty and hospitalization costs for SILA compared with TILA. Other outcome variables such as operative time, blood loss, time to first oral intake, postoperative pain and complications were not found to be statistically significant for either group. Conclusions: Compared with TILA, SILA has the advantage of shorter hospital stay, and it can achieve comparable operative time, blood loss, postoperative recovery, postoperative pain and complications with TILA. The drawback is that SILA is associated with higher conversion rate, and perhaps higher surgical difficulty and hospitalization costs. Whether it can achieve improvement in cosmesis remains to be confirmed.”

P3. Introduction / Rationale: Describe the rationale for the review in the context of what is already known.

* Quote: “Single-incision laparoscopic surgery (SILS) is the novel member of the minimally invasive surgery [4], it's a new innovation allowing minimal invasive surgery to be performed through a single umbilical incision, and it can further reduce the trauma of surgical access [5]. SILS has made great strides forward in general surgery, urological and gynecological surgery in recent years [6–11], its treatment for appendicitis (i.e. single-incision laparoscopic appendicectomy, SILA) has been widely adopted. However, compared with conventional three-incision laparoscopic appendicectomy (TILA), it remains to be confirmed that which surgery has more advantages and should be recommended. Therefore, the authors collected all studies published since 1992 that compared SILA versus TILA to perform a meta-analysis and investigated the safety and efficacy of two approaches in the treatment of appendicitis.”

A1. Was an 'a priori' design provided? The research question and inclusion criteria should be established before the conduct of the review. Note: Need to refer to a protocol, ethics approval, or pre-determined/a priori published research objectives to score a “yes.”

* Quote: ""The aim of our study was to evaluate the availability of Level 1 studies comparing laparoscopic procedures with the corresponding open operation in pediatric surgery.""
* Reasoning: The research question is clearly stated in the introduction, but there is no explicit mention of an 'a priori' design or a protocol.
* Response: [No]

A2. Was there duplicate study selection and data extraction? There should be at least two independent data extractors and a consensus procedure for disagreements should be in place. Note: 2 people do study selection, 2 people do data extraction, consensus process or one person checks the other’s work.

* Quote: ""All manuscripts were reviewed by two independent reviewers (JD and BMU) and disagreements were resolved by consensus.""
* Reasoning: The full text mentions that two independent reviewers performed study selection and data extraction, and disagreements were resolved by consensus.
* Response: [Yes]

A3. Was a comprehensive literature search performed? At least two electronic sources should be searched. The report must include years and databases used (e.g., Central, EMBASE, and MEDLINE). Key words and/or MESH terms must be stated and where feasible the search strategy should be provided. All searches should be supplemented by consulting current contents, reviews, textbooks, specialized registers, or experts in the particular field of study, and by reviewing the references in the studies found. Note: If at least 2 sources + one supplementary strategy used, select “yes” (Cochrane register/Central counts as 2 sources; a grey literature search counts as supplementary).

* Quote: ""Clinical Level 1 studies (SR, MA, and RCT) published in the English literature were identified through a Medline literature search using PubMed (www.pubmed.com). The Web site was last accessed on May 5, 2012. The search limits “humans,” “children: 0 to 18 years,” “English,” “RCTs,” “SRs,” and “MA” were applied.""
* Reasoning: The full text mentions that a comprehensive literature search was performed using PubMed, and the search strategy is provided. However, it is not explicitly stated that other electronic sources were searched.
* Response: [No]

A4. Was the status of publication (i.e. grey literature) used as an inclusion criterion? The authors should state that they searched for reports regardless of their publication type. The authors should state whether or not they excluded any reports (from the systematic review), based on their publication status, language etc. Note: If review indicates that there was a search for “grey literature” or “unpublished literature,” indicate “yes.” SIGLE database, dissertations, conference proceedings, and trial registries are all considered grey for this purpose. If searching a source that contains both grey and non-grey, must specify that they were searching for grey/unpublished lit.

* Quote: ""Clinical Level 1 studies (SR, MA, and RCT) published in the English literature were identified through a Medline literature search using PubMed (www.pubmed.com). The Web site was last accessed on May 5, 2012. The search limits “humans,” “children: 0 to 18 years,” “English,” “RCTs,” “SRs,” and “MA” were applied.""
* Reasoning: The full text does not explicitly mention whether grey literature was searched or not.
* Response: [NA]

A5. Was a list of studies (included and excluded) provided? A list of included and excluded studies should be provided. Note: Acceptable if the excluded studies are referenced. If there is an electronic link to the list but the link is dead, select “no.”

* Quote: ""A total of 20 manuscripts met the inclusion criteria for our SR, of which 9 were SRs or MAs and 11 RCTs.""
* Reasoning: The full text mentions the number of included studies, but there is no explicit list of included and excluded studies.
* Response: [No]

A6. Were the characteristics of the included studies provided? In an aggregated form such as a table, data from the original studies should be provided on the participants, interventions and outcomes. The ranges of characteristics in all the studies analyzed e.g., age, race, sex, relevant socioeconomic data, disease status, duration, severity, or other diseases should be reported. Note: Acceptable if not in table format as long as they are described as above.

* Quote: ""Studies providing evidence Level 1a were identified for five types of laparoscopic procedures (laparoscopic appendectomy, inguinal hernia repair, orchidopexy, pyloromyotomy, and varicocelectomy). Studies providing evidence Level 1b were identified for two types of laparoscopic procedures (fundoplication and pyeloplasty).""
* Reasoning: The full text provides a summary of the characteristics of the included studies, but it is not in an aggregated form such as a table.
* Response: [Yes]

A7. Was the scientific quality of the included studies assessed and documented? 'A priori' methods of assessment should be provided (e.g., for effectiveness studies if the author(s) chose to include only randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled studies, or allocation concealment as inclusion criteria); for other types of studies alternative items will be relevant. Note: Can include use of a quality scoring tool or checklist, e.g., Jadad scale, risk of bias, sensitivity analysis, etc., or a description of quality items, with some kind of result for EACH study (“low” or “high” is fine, as long as it is clear which studies scored “low” and which scored “high”; a summary score/range for all studies is not acceptable).

* Quote: ""The advantages of laparoscopy were less wound infections, ileus and postoperative pain (appendectomy), less retching (fundoplication), lower incidence of metachronous inguinal hernia, shorter hospital stay (appendectomy, orchiopexy, and pyeloplasty), and shorter time to full feeds (pyloromyotomy).""
* Reasoning: The full text provides a summary of the scientific quality of the included studies, but it is not explicitly documented using a quality scoring tool or checklist.
* Response: [No]

A8. Was the scientific quality of the included studies used appropriately in formulating conclusions? The results of the methodological rigor and scientific quality should be considered in the analysis and the conclusions of the review, and explicitly stated in formulating recommendations. Note: Might say something such as “the results should be interpreted with caution due to poor quality of included studies.” Cannot score “yes” for this question if scored “no” for question A7.

* Quote: ""The advantages of laparoscopy were less wound infections, ileus and postoperative pain (appendectomy), less retching (fundoplication), lower incidence of metachronous inguinal hernia, shorter hospital stay (appendectomy, orchiopexy, and pyeloplasty), and shorter time to full feeds (pyloromyotomy).""
* Reasoning: The full text provides a summary of the scientific quality of the included studies, but it is not explicitly used in formulating conclusions.
* Response: [No]

A9. Were the methods used to combine the findings of studies appropriate? For the pooled results, a test should be done to ensure the studies were combinable, to assess their homogeneity (i.e., Chi-squared test for homogeneity, I2 ). If heterogeneity exists a random effects model should be used and/or the clinical appropriateness of combining should be taken into consideration (i.e., is it sensible to combine?). Note: Indicate “yes” if they mention or describe heterogeneity, i.e., if they explain that they cannot pool because of heterogeneity/variability between interventions.

* Quote: N/A
* Reasoning: This question is not applicable in the context of a systematic review without a meta-analysis.
* Response: [NA]

A10. Was the likelihood of publication bias assessed? An assessment of publication bias should include a combination of graphical aids (e.g., funnel plot, other available tests) and/or statistical tests (e.g., Egger regression test, Hedges-Olken). Note: If no test values or funnel plot included, score “no”. Score “yes” if mentions that publication bias could not be assessed because there were fewer than 10 included studies.

* Quote: N/A
* Reasoning: This question is not applicable in the context of a systematic review without a meta-analysis.
* Response: [NA]

A11. Was the conflict of interest included? Potential sources of support should be clearly acknowledged in both the systematic review and the included studies. Note: To get a “yes,” must indicate source of funding or support for the systematic review AND for each of the included studies.

* Quote: ""Address for correspondence Jens Dingemann, MD, Centre of Pediatric Surgery, Hannover Medical School and Bult Children’s Hospital, Carl-Neuberg-Str. 1, 30625 Hannover, Germany (e-mail: dingemann.jens@mh-hannover.de).""

AMSTAR:

A1. Was an 'a priori' design provided? The research question and inclusion criteria should be established before the conduct of the review. Note: Need to refer to a protocol, ethics approval, or pre-determined/a priori published research objectives to score a “yes.”

* Quote: ""A review of literature was performed.""
* Reasoning: There is no mention of an 'a priori' design or a protocol.
* Response: [No]

A2. Was there duplicate study selection and data extraction? There should be at least two independent data extractors and a consensus procedure for disagreements should be in place. Note: 2 people do study selection, 2 people do data extraction, consensus process or one person checks the other’s work.

* Quote: ""One reviewer (GF) screened all titles and abstracts to assess whether each report was potentially eligible for inclusion, and whether or not the full text was available. Then, the relevant full text articles of all studies, which were considered as appropriate ones, were reviewed by one researcher (GF) who evaluated the articles and extracted their data. Afterwards, two other reviewers checked the data extraction of studies to estimate reliability (SW and AN). Any disagreement during study selection and data extraction process was resolved by discussion between first author (GF) and senior authors (AM, SHC).""
* Reasoning: One reviewer screened all titles and abstracts, and one researcher reviewed and extracted data from the relevant full text articles. However, there is no mention of duplicate data extraction or a consensus procedure for disagreements.
* Response: [No]

A3. Was a comprehensive literature search performed? At least two electronic sources should be searched. The report must include years and databases used (e.g., Central, EMBASE, and MEDLINE). Key words and/or MESH terms must be stated and where feasible the search strategy should be provided. All searches should be supplemented by consulting current contents, reviews, textbooks, specialized registers, or experts in the particular field of study, and by reviewing the references in the studies found. Note: If at least 2 sources + one supplementary strategy used, select “yes” (Cochrane register/Central counts as 2 sources; a grey literature search counts as supplementary).

* Quote: ""A systematic literature search was carried out using the search terms 'bowel lengthening', 'intestinal lengthening', 'longitudinal intestinal lengthening and tailoring', 'LILT', 'Bianchi procedure', 'serial transverse enteroplasty' and 'step procedure'. The last search was done on December, 10th, 2012. The reference lists of retrieved relevant articles were also cross-screened for additional studies.""
* Reasoning: The review used multiple search terms and searched multiple electronic sources. However, the specific databases used are not mentioned.
* Response: [NA]

A4. Was the status of publication (i.e. grey literature) used as an inclusion criterion? The authors should state that they searched for reports regardless of their publication type. The authors should state whether or not they excluded any reports (from the systematic review), based on their publication status, language etc. Note: If review indicates that there was a search for 'grey literature' or 'unpublished literature', indicate 'yes'. SIGLE database, dissertations, conference proceedings, and trial registries are all considered grey for this purpose. If searching a source that contains both grey and non-grey, must specify that they were searching for grey/unpublished lit.

* Quote: ""The articles published in languages other than English or German and those articles providing insufficient data were excluded from the literature review.""
* Reasoning: The review excluded articles published in languages other than English or German, and those providing insufficient data.
* Response: [No]

A5. Was a list of studies (included and excluded) provided? A list of included and excluded studies should be provided. Note: Acceptable if the excluded studies are referenced. If there is an electronic link to the list but the link is dead, select “no.”

* Quote: ""N = 39 articles with useable information (LILT n = 24 articles, STEP n = 15 articles), including n = 472 patients (LILT n = 363 patients, STEP n = 109 patients) remained to be analyzed and are reviewed here.""
* Reasoning: The review provides a list of included studies, but not a list of excluded studies.
* Response: [No]

A6. Were the characteristics of the included studies provided? In an aggregated form such as a table, data from the original studies should be provided on the participants, interventions and outcomes. The ranges of characteristics in all the studies analyzed e.g., age, race, sex, relevant socioeconomic data, disease status, duration, severity, or other diseases should be reported. Note: Acceptable if not in table format as long as they are described as above.

* Quote: ""The distribution of LILT cases within reports was as follows: less than 5 cases [11--17], 5 to 19 cases [18--26], 20 to 50 cases [9,27--31] and more than 50 cases [8,32]. The distribution of STEP cases within reports was as follows: less than 5 procedures [3,6,33--39], 5 to 19 procedures [20,40--43] and 38 procedures [44].""
* Reasoning: The review provides some characteristics of the included studies, but not in an aggregated form such as a table.
* Response: [NA]

A7. Was the scientific quality of the included studies assessed and documented? 'A priori' methods of assessment should be provided (e.g., for effectiveness studies if the author(s) chose to include only randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled studies, or allocation concealment as inclusion criteria); for other types of studies alternative items will be relevant. Note: Can include use of a quality scoring tool or checklist, e.g., Jadad scale, risk of bias, sensitivity analysis, etc., or a description of quality items, with some kind of result for EACH study (“low” or “high” is fine, as long as it is clear which studies scored “low” and which scored “high”; a summary score/range for all studies is not acceptable).

* Quote: ""Included studies revealed significant methodological and clinical heterogeneity. Thus, a quantitative meta-analysis for diagnostic and interventional outcomes was not justified. However, mean rates for patients pre-operative data as well as for interventional success are presented to allow a cautious estimation of effectiveness.""
* Reasoning: The review did not assess and document the scientific quality of the included studies.
* Response: [No]

A8. Was the scientific quality of the included studies used appropriately in formulating conclusions? The results of the methodological rigor and scientific quality should be considered in the analysis and the conclusions of the review, and explicitly stated in formulating recommendations. Note: Might say something such as 'the results should be interpreted with caution due to poor quality of included studies'. Cannot score 'yes' for this question if scored 'no' for question A7.

* Quote: ""Included studies revealed significant methodological and clinical heterogeneity. Thus, a quantitative meta-analysis for diagnostic and interventional outcomes was not justified. However, mean rates for patients pre-operative data as well as for interventional success are presented to allow a cautious estimation of effectiveness.""
* Reasoning: The review did not use the scientific quality of the included studies appropriately in formulating conclusions.
* Response: [No]

A9. Were the methods used to combine the findings of studies appropriate? For the pooled results, a test should be done to ensure the studies were combinable, to assess their homogeneity (i.e., Chi-squared test for homogeneity, I2 ). If heterogeneity exists a random effects model should be used and/or the clinical appropriateness of combining should be taken into consideration (i.e., is it sensible to combine?). Note: Indicate 'yes' if they mention or describe heterogeneity, i.e., if they explain that they cannot pool because of heterogeneity/variability between interventions.

* Quote: ""Included studies revealed significant methodological and clinical heterogeneity. Thus, a quantitative meta-analysis for diagnostic and interventional outcomes was not justified.""
* Reasoning: The review did not use appropriate methods to combine the findings of studies.
* Response: [No]

A10. Was the likelihood of publication bias assessed? An assessment of publication bias should include a combination of graphical aids (e.g., funnel plot, other available tests) and/or statistical tests (e.g., Egger regression test, Hedges-Olken). Note: If no test values or funnel plot included, score 'no'. Score 'yes' if mentions that publication bias could not be assessed because there were fewer than 10 included studies.

* Quote: ""Included studies revealed significant methodological and clinical heterogeneity. Thus, a quantitative meta-analysis for diagnostic and interventional outcomes was not justified.""
* Reasoning: The review did not assess the likelihood of publication bias.
* Response: [No]

A11. Was the conflict of interest included? Potential sources of support should be clearly acknowledged in both the systematic review and the included studies. Note: To get a 'yes', must indicate source of funding or support for the systematic review AND for each of the included studies.

* Quote: ""The authors are very grateful to 'Heidelberger Stiftung Chirurgie' for supporting this publication.""
* Reasoning: The review acknowledges support for the publication, but not for the systematic review or the included studies.
* Response: [No]

AMSTAR:

A1. Was an 'a priori' design provided? The research question and inclusion criteria should be established before the conduct of the review. Note: Need to refer to a protocol, ethics approval, or pre-determined/a priori published research objectives to score a “yes.”

* Quote: ""A review of literature was performed.""
* Reasoning: There is no mention of an 'a priori' design or a protocol.
* Response: [No]

A2. Was there duplicate study selection and data extraction? There should be at least two independent data extractors and a consensus procedure for disagreements should be in place. Note: 2 people do study selection, 2 people do data extraction, consensus process or one person checks the other’s work.

* Quote: ""One reviewer (GF) screened all titles and abstracts to assess whether each report was potentially eligible for inclusion, and whether or not the full text was available. Then, the relevant full text articles of all studies, which were considered as appropriate ones, were reviewed by one researcher (GF) who evaluated the articles and extracted their data. Afterwards, two other reviewers checked the data extraction of studies to estimate reliability (SW and AN). Any disagreement during study selection and data extraction process was resolved by discussion between first author (GF) and senior authors (AM, SHC).""
* Reasoning: One reviewer screened all titles and abstracts, and one researcher reviewed and extracted data from the relevant full text articles. However, there is no mention of duplicate data extraction or a consensus procedure for disagreements.
* Response: [No]

A3. Was a comprehensive literature search performed? At least two electronic sources should be searched. The report must include years and databases used (e.g., Central, EMBASE, and MEDLINE). Key words and/or MESH terms must be stated and where feasible the search strategy should be provided. All searches should be supplemented by consulting current contents, reviews, textbooks, specialized registers, or experts in the particular field of study, and by reviewing the references in the studies found. Note: If at least 2 sources + one supplementary strategy used, select “yes” (Cochrane register/Central counts as 2 sources; a grey literature search counts as supplementary).

* Quote: ""A systematic literature search was carried out using the search terms 'bowel lengthening', 'intestinal lengthening', 'longitudinal intestinal lengthening and tailoring', 'LILT', 'Bianchi procedure', 'serial transverse enteroplasty' and 'step procedure'. The last search was done on December, 10th, 2012. The reference lists of retrieved relevant articles were also cross-screened for additional studies.""
* Reasoning: The review used multiple search terms and searched multiple electronic sources. However, the specific databases used are not mentioned.
* Response: [NA]

A4. Was the status of publication (i.e. grey literature) used as an inclusion criterion? The authors should state that they searched for reports regardless of their publication type. The authors should state whether or not they excluded any reports (from the systematic review), based on their publication status, language etc. Note: If review indicates that there was a search for 'grey literature' or 'unpublished literature', indicate 'yes'. SIGLE database, dissertations, conference proceedings, and trial registries are all considered grey for this purpose. If searching a source that contains both grey and non-grey, must specify that they were searching for grey/unpublished lit.

* Quote: ""The articles published in languages other than English or German and those articles providing insufficient data were excluded from the literature review.""
* Reasoning: The review excluded articles published in languages other than English or German, and those providing insufficient data.
* Response: [No]

A5. Was a list of studies (included and excluded) provided? A list of included and excluded studies should be provided. Note: Acceptable if the excluded studies are referenced. If there is an electronic link to the list but the link is dead, select “no.”

* Quote: ""N = 39 articles with useable information (LILT n = 24 articles, STEP n = 15 articles), including n = 472 patients (LILT n = 363 patients, STEP n = 109 patients) remained to be analyzed and are reviewed here.""
* Reasoning: The review provides a list of included studies, but not a list of excluded studies.
* Response: [No]

A6. Were the characteristics of the included studies provided? In an aggregated form such as a table, data from the original studies should be provided on the participants, interventions and outcomes. The ranges of characteristics in all the studies analyzed e.g., age, race, sex, relevant socioeconomic data, disease status, duration, severity, or other diseases should be reported. Note: Acceptable if not in table format as long as they are described as above.

* Quote: ""The distribution of LILT cases within reports was as follows: less than 5 cases [11--17], 5 to 19 cases [18--26], 20 to 50 cases [9,27--31] and more than 50 cases [8,32]. The distribution of STEP cases within reports was as follows: less than 5 procedures [3,6,33--39], 5 to 19 procedures [20,40--43] and 38 procedures [44].""
* Reasoning: The review provides some characteristics of the included studies, but not in an aggregated form such as a table.
* Response: [NA]

A7. Was the scientific quality of the included studies assessed and documented? 'A priori' methods of assessment should be provided (e.g., for effectiveness studies if the author(s) chose to include only randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled studies, or allocation concealment as inclusion criteria); for other types of studies alternative items will be relevant. Note: Can include use of a quality scoring tool or checklist, e.g., Jadad scale, risk of bias, sensitivity analysis, etc., or a description of quality items, with some kind of result for EACH study (“low” or “high” is fine, as long as it is clear which studies scored “low” and which scored “high”; a summary score/range for all studies is not acceptable).

* Quote: ""Included studies revealed significant methodological and clinical heterogeneity. Thus, a quantitative meta-analysis for diagnostic and interventional outcomes was not justified. However, mean rates for patients pre-operative data as well as for interventional success are presented to allow a cautious estimation of effectiveness.""
* Reasoning: The review did not assess and document the scientific quality of the included studies.
* Response: [No]

A8. Was the scientific quality of the included studies used appropriately in formulating conclusions? The results of the methodological rigor and scientific quality should be considered in the analysis and the conclusions of the review, and explicitly stated in formulating recommendations. Note: Might say something such as 'the results should be interpreted with caution due to poor quality of included studies'. Cannot score 'yes' for this question if scored 'no' for question A7.

* Quote: ""Included studies revealed significant methodological and clinical heterogeneity. Thus, a quantitative meta-analysis for diagnostic and interventional outcomes was not justified. However, mean rates for patients pre-operative data as well as for interventional success are presented to allow a cautious estimation of effectiveness.""
* Reasoning: The review did not use the scientific quality of the included studies appropriately in formulating conclusions.
* Response: [No]

A9. Were the methods used to combine the findings of studies appropriate? For the pooled results, a test should be done to ensure the studies were combinable, to assess their homogeneity (i.e., Chi-squared test for homogeneity, I2 ). If heterogeneity exists a random effects model should be used and/or the clinical appropriateness of combining should be taken into consideration (i.e., is it sensible to combine?). Note: Indicate 'yes' if they mention or describe heterogeneity, i.e., if they explain that they cannot pool because of heterogeneity/variability between interventions.

* Quote: ""Included studies revealed significant methodological and clinical heterogeneity. Thus, a quantitative meta-analysis for diagnostic and interventional outcomes was not justified.""
* Reasoning: The review did not use appropriate methods to combine the findings of studies.
* Response: [No]

A10. Was the likelihood of publication bias assessed? An assessment of publication bias should include a combination of graphical aids (e.g., funnel plot, other available tests) and/or statistical tests (e.g., Egger regression test, Hedges-Olken). Note: If no test values or funnel plot included, score 'no'. Score 'yes' if mentions that publication bias could not be assessed because there were fewer than 10 included studies.

* Quote: ""Included studies revealed significant methodological and clinical heterogeneity. Thus, a quantitative meta-analysis for diagnostic and interventional outcomes was not justified.""
* Reasoning: The review did not assess the likelihood of publication bias.
* Response: [No]

A11. Was the conflict of interest included? Potential sources of support should be clearly acknowledged in both the systematic review and the included studies. Note: To get a 'yes', must indicate source of funding or support for the systematic review AND for each of the included studies.

* Quote: ""The authors are very grateful to 'Heidelberger Stiftung Chirurgie' for supporting this publication.""
* Reasoning: The review acknowledges support for the publication, but not for the systematic review or the included studies.

* Response: [Yes]

A2. Was there duplicate study selection and data extraction? There should be at least two independent data extractors and a consensus procedure for disagreements should be in place.

* Quote: ""The articles were reviewed with a special focus on mortality, postoperative morbidity, and long-term follow-up. Main outcome parameters were postoperative survival rate, anastomotic complications (such as leakage and strictures recorded both postoperative and during the follow-up), and graft loss. Secondary outcome parameters were early respiratory complications (pneumothorax, pneumonia, atelectasis, mediastinitis, pleural effusion, and temporary diaphragm/vocal cord paresis), hospital stay, and intensive care unit (ICU) stay.""
* Reasoning: The review did not explicitly state that there were two independent data extractors and a consensus procedure for disagreements.

* Reasoning: The review did not explicitly state that they searched for reports regardless of their publication type or whether they excluded any reports based on their publication status, language, etc.
* Response: [No]

A5. Was a list of studies (included and excluded) provided? A list of included and excluded studies should be provided.

* Quote: ""The initial search yielded 187 potentially relevant articles, of which 172 articles were excluded because of the failure to meet the inclusion criteria. A total of 15 studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria and were analyzed in this review.""
* Reasoning: The review provided a list of included studies, but did not provide a list of excluded studies.
* Response: [No]

A6. Were the characteristics of the included studies provided? In an aggregated form such as a table, data from the original studies should be provided on the participants, interventions and outcomes. The ranges of characteristics in all the studies analyzed e.g., age, race, sex, relevant socioeconomic data, disease status, duration, severity, or other diseases should be reported.

* Quote: ""Data about postoperative mortality and morbidity were given in 14 studies with a total of 470 patients (264 LGEA); 344 (73%) patients underwent CI, 99 (21%) children underwent GPU, and 27 (6%) patients underwent JI. Among these studies nine reported follow-up data. One of these studies focused exclusively on follow-up after the treatment of corrosive esophageal strictures. This study was also included in the present article (107 patients treated by GPU and 69 by CI), so that long-term gastrointestinal data were available for 394 children: 207 (52%) after CI, 27 (7%) after JI, 160 (41%) after GPU. Respiratory data were available for 377 children: 190 after CI (50%), 27 after JI (7%), and 160 after GPU (43%). The majority of long-term data regards patients treated for corrosive strictures, followed by those treated for LGEA. The follow-up period ranged from 0.5 to 41 years.""

* Reasoning: The review did not explicitly state that they assessed and documented the scientific quality of the included studies.
* Response: [No]

A8. Was the scientific quality of the included studies used appropriately in formulating conclusions? The results of the methodological rigor and scientific quality should be considered in the analysis and the conclusions of the review, and explicitly stated in formulating recommendations.

* Quote: ""The present article set out to perform a meta-analysis of the literature regarding esophageal replacement for LGEA or extensive corrosive strictures. There are few prospective series, amounting to only 37 patients. Well-designed propective comparative studies are lacking, major and minor postoperative complications are sometimes not properly defined, follow-up data are often deficient and when presented they are not homogenously described in the different studies. These make comparison a challenging task. More-over, CI makes up for the majority of the surgical procedures reported. Far fewer studies describe the results of GPU and only two authors have illustrated their experience with JI.""
* Reasoning: The review did not explicitly state that they used the scientific quality of the included studies appropriately in formulating conclusions.
* Response: [No]

A9. Were the methods used to combine the findings of studies appropriate? For the pooled results, a test should be done to ensure the studies were combinable, to assess their homogeneity (i.e., Chi-squared test for homogeneity, I2 ). If heterogeneity exists a random effects model should be used and/or the clinical appropriateness of combining should be taken into consideration (i.e., is it sensible to combine?).

* Quote: Not applicable as the review did not perform a meta-analysis.
* Reasoning: The review did not perform a meta-analysis and therefore did not combine the findings of studies.

* Quote: ""Aim There is still no consensus about the optimal surgical approach for esophageal replacement in the case of long-gap esophageal atresia (LGEA) or extensive corrosive strictures. The aim of this article was to perform a meta-analysis comparing the most widely used techniques for esophageal replacement in children: jejunal interposition (JI), colon interposition (CI), and gastric pull-up (GPU). Methods Review of the English-language literature published in the past 5 years about esophageal replacement in children was done. The focus was on postoperative survival rate, morbidity (gastrointestinal complications such as anastomotic stenosis/leakage and respiratory complications such as pneumothorax, pneumonia, and atelectasis), and long-term follow-up when available. Among long-term gastrointestinal outcomes were dysphagia, reflux, and dumping; among long-term respiratory outcomes were recurrent pneumonia and recurrent aspiration leading to chronic lung disease. Data were computed by Comprehensive Meta-Analysis software (Version 2.2.064). Main Results A total of 15 studies (4 comparative retrospective, 8 retrospective, and 3 prospective) including 470 patients (264 LGEA) were identified; 344 (73%) patients underwent CI, 99 (21%) GPU, and 27 (6%) JI. Among these 15 studies, 9 provided data about long-term follow-up. Conclusion Proper prospective comparative studies are lacking. GPU and CI appear comparable regarding postoperative mortality, anastomotic complications, and graft loss. On the long-term, GPU seems to be associated with a higher respiratory morbidity but fewer gastrointestinal complications than CI. Based on this article only two series provide data about JI, and they show highly divergent results. JI appears to be a valid replacement technique when performed by experienced centers; however larger numbers are needed to assess the outcomes of this procedure.""

* Response: [No]

A8. Was the scientific quality of the included studies used appropriately in formulating conclusions? The results of the methodological rigor and scientific quality should be considered in the analysis and the conclusions of the review, and explicitly stated in formulating recommendations. Note: Might say something such as “the results should be interpreted with caution due to poor quality of included studies.” Cannot score “yes” for this question if scored “no” for question A7.

* Quote: ""Constipation: The mean rate of constipation was 21% (range 0 to 59%) in the OPEN group compared with 10% (range 0 to 27%) in the L-TERPT/TERPT group.

* Reasoning: The scientific quality of the included studies is not considered in the analysis or conclusions.
* Response: [No]

A9. Were the methods used to combine the findings of studies appropriate? For the pooled results, a test should be done to ensure the studies were combinable, to assess their homogeneity (i.e., Chi-squared test for homogeneity, I2 ). If heterogeneity exists a random effects model should be used and/or the clinical appropriateness of combining should be taken into consideration (i.e., is it sensible to combine?). Note: Indicate “yes” if they mention or describe heterogeneity, i.e., if they explain that they cannot pool because of heterogeneity/variability between interventions.

* Reasoning: The methods used to combine the findings of studies are not explicitly stated.
* Response: [No]

A10. Was the likelihood of publication bias assessed? An assessment of publication bias should include a combination of graphical aids (e.g., funnel plot, other available tests) and/or statistical tests (e.g., Egger regression test, Hedges-Olken). Note: If no test values or funnel plot included, score “no”. Score “yes” if mentions that publication bias could not be assessed because there were fewer than 10 included studies.

* Quote: ""Not applicable.""
* Reasoning: The likelihood of publication bias is not assessed.
* Response: [No]

A11. Was the conflict of interest included? Potential sources of support should be clearly acknowledged in both the systematic review and the included studies. Note: To get a “yes,” must indicate source of funding or support for the systematic review AND for each of the included studies.

* Quote: ""Abstract: Introduction: Various surgical techniques for the treatment of Hirschsprung disease (HD) have been proposed. The most relevant long-term complications of HD surgery include constipation, soiling/incontinence, enterocolitis, and anastomotic stricture. To date, there has been no randomized controlled trial evaluating the long-term outcome of OPEN surgery compared with transanal approaches with and without laparoscopy (laparoscopic-assisted transanal-endorectal pull-through [L-TERPT] and transanal-endorectal pull-through [TERPT]). We performed a systematic literature review of the long-term outcome of OPEN surgery compared with L-TERPT/TERPT. Methods: Our systematic review of the recent literature (2008 to 2012) included reports on long-term outcome of either OPEN surgery or L-TERPT/TERPT with a minimum follow-up period of 12 months. With the cumulative data, a comparative meta-analysis was performed for the outcome parameters “constipation,” “soiling/incontinence,” “enterocolitis,” and “anastomotic stricture.” Results: Functional outcome of surgical techniques for HD was highly variable. We could show a significant advantage of L-TERPT/TERPT over OPEN surgery regarding the incidence of soiling/incontinence and constipation. No differences were seen for enterocolitis and anastomotic stricture. Conclusion: Significant differences in the long-term outcome of OPEN surgery compared with L-TERPT/TERPT were identified in this review. We conclude from our data that L-TERPT/TERPT represents a valid option in the treatment of HD and might have some advantages over the OPEN techniques. However, the present data should be interpreted carefully due to limitations in the quality of the study design in most reports. Prospective, randomized, multicenter trials are urgently needed to overcome this weakness of the current literature.""

* Quote: ""Discussion: Several large multicenter series confirmed an excellent safety and feasibility of L-TERPT/TERPT. It was suggested that L-TERPT and TERPT had advantages over OPEN procedures such as shorter time to feeding, shorter hospital stay, less pain, and better cosmesis. However, functional results after transanal repair versus open techniques may not be superior and even associated with additional problems due to extensive stretching by retractors to gain visualization with subsequent damage to the anal canal. To date, there has been no randomized controlled study evaluating the long-term outcome of OPEN surgery compared with L-TERPT/TERPT. Therefore, the present review could only focus on retrospective studies with a high variability of follow-up periods and definition of outcome parameters. We focused on long-term outcome in HD patients operated with conventional transabdominal pull-through (OPEN) compared with transanal endorectal pull-through with or without laparoscopy (L-TERPT/TERPT) using four major outcome parameters: constipation, incontinence, enterocolitis and anastomotic stricture. Constipation: The incidence of postpull-through constipation in the current literature ranges from 0 to 59%. Suspected causes include abnormal motility of the pulled-through segment and abnormal function of the internal anal sphincter due to the underlying disease or preceding surgery. However, most authors describe an improvement of constipation in late childhood. Our systematic review revealed postoperative constipation rates of up to 59%. Furthermore, it confirms previous reports on a higher incidence of postoperative constipation after OPEN surgery when compared with L-TERPT/TERPT. Soiling/Incontinence: Most patients with HD have been reported to suffer from soiling which remains the major cause of psychological and social problems in these patients. Besides constipation, fecal soiling/incontinence has therefore been identified as the most relevant long-term complication after any type of surgery for HD. Three major causes of soiling have been described: abnormal sphincter function, abnormal sensation, and “pseudoincontinence.” The latter is caused by either severe constipation with fecal overflow or hypermotility of the pulled-through colon. Levitt et al postulate that sphincter function and sensation may be damaged during the primary repair, and that the colonic motility is substantially affected by an operation for HD. However, it is noteworthy that patients with HD lack rectoanal relaxation reflex not only after but also before surgery. Therefore, it remains unclear to what extent surgical dissection of the rectum compromises relevant nerval structures responsible for anal canal sensa-tion, sphincter competence, and colonic motility. There is an ongoing debate on whether the incidence of soiling/incontinence is associated with the operative technique. Some authors suggest that extensive mechani-cal stretching during L-TERPT/TERPT by retractors can damage the anal canal and might therefore lead to a higher incidence of incontinent HD patients. However, our data do not reflect these concerns as it shows that soiling/incontinence occurs significantly more often after OPEN compared with L-TERPT/TERPT surgery. The higher incidence of soiling/incontinence in the OPEN surgery group may derive from deep pelvic dissection affecting pelvic nerves and therefore compromising both sphincter function and sensa-tion. Enterocolitis: Hirschsprung-associated enterocolitis (HAEC) represents an-other major postoperative complication and is the most common cause of death in children with HD. The patho-genesis of HAEC is still unknown. Several risk factors for HAEC have been identified including diagnosis at young age, anastomotic stricture, and malnutrition. Some authors report that obstruction at the level of the anus leading to intestinal stasis may play a major role in HAEC pathogenesis. The potential reasons for intestinal stasis include a spastic or long cuff, presuming that a shorter cuff might help to reduce postoperative enterocolitis. However, as HAEC may occur both before and after surgery for HD, the high incidence of HAEC cannot be explained by partial obstruction alone. We did not find a significant difference in the incidence of enterocolitis after OPEN surgery compared with L-TERPT/TERPT. This may indicate that HAEC is rather part of the underlying pathology of HD than a result of a particular surgical technique. Anastomotic Stricture: Multiple risk factors for anastomotic stricture including anastomotic ischemia, anastomotic leakage, and cuff ischemia have been described. Various surgical techniques were suggested to prevent stricture formation, such as an oblique coloanal anastomosis reported by Swenson. The studies analyzed in this review showed no significant difference in the incidence of anastomotic stricture after OPEN surgery compared with L-TERPT/TERPT surgery. Discussion: Although the present review of the recent literature revealed a higher incidence of constipation and soiling/incontinence after OPEN surgery compared with L-TERPT/TERPT, these data need to be carefully interpreted. The following limitations of the present analysis and validity of the data on the long-term outcome in the current literature may be discussed: • There was a lack of uniform definitions of outcome parameters after surgery for HD such as constipation, soiling, incontinence, enterocolitis, and stricture. • In a very few studies, standardized scores to describe endpoints were used. • L-TERPT and TERPT were analyzed as one group, which is due to the difficulty to distinguish whether laparoscopy was used for biopsies only or for dissection of the rectum. A comprehensive description of the surgical technique was lacking in numerous reports. • The OPEN surgery group consisted of several pull-through techniques such as Soave, Swenson, Duhamel, and Rehbein which might have led to a high variability of results. • The OPEN group was comparable to the L-TERPT/TERPT group in terms of “age at surgery” and “group size” but the follow-up period was significantly longer. As the functional results tend to be more favorable with increasing age, the high rate of constipation and soiling in the OPEN group is remarkable. • Comparative, randomized studies evaluating outcome of OPEN surgery versus L-TERPT/TERPT were not available for this review. Therefore, the validity of the data and level of evidence of the present analysis is limited. Conclusion: Functional outcome of different surgical techniques for HD is highly variable. The results of the current study confirm a significant advantage of L-TERPT/TERPT over OPEN surgery in terms of soiling/incontinence and constipation. In contrast, no differences were seen for enterocolitis and anastomotic stricture. Several limitations to this systematic review such as the different quality of studies and small cohort sizes need to be considered when interpreting these data. Moreover, only few authors used standardized scores to assess functional outcome. Hence, prospective, randomized, multicenter trials are urgently needed to overcome this weakness of the available reports in current literature.""

The most relevant long-term complications of HD surgery include constipation, soiling/incontinence, enterocolitis, and anastomotic stricture. To date, there has been no randomized controlled trial evaluating the long-term outcome of OPEN surgery compared with transanal approaches with and without laparoscopy (laparoscopic-assisted transanal-endorectal pull-through [L-TERPT] and transanal-endorectal pull-through [TERPT]). We performed a systematic literature review of the long-term outcome of OPEN surgery compared with L-TERPT/TERPT. Methods: Our systematic review of the recent literature (2008 to 2012) included reports on long-term outcome of either OPEN surgery or L-TERPT/TERPT with a minimum follow-up period of 12 months. With the cumulative data, a comparative meta-analysis was performed for the outcome parameters “constipation,” “soiling/incontinence,” “enterocolitis,” and “anastomotic stricture.” Results: Functional outcome of surgical techniques for HD was highly variable. We could show a significant advantage of L-TERPT/TERPT over OPEN surgery regarding the incidence of soiling/incontinence and constipation. No differences were seen for enterocolitis and anastomotic stricture. Conclusion: Significant differences in the long-term outcome of OPEN surgery compared with L-TERPT/TERPT were identified in this review. We conclude from our data that L-TERPT/TERPT represents a valid option in the treatment of HD and might have some advantages over the OPEN techniques.

* Quote: ""Discussion: Several large multicenter series confirmed an excellent safety and feasibility of L-TERPT/TERPT. It was suggested that L-TERPT and TERPT had advantages over OPEN procedures such as shorter time to feeding, shorter hospital stay, less pain, and better cosmesis. However, functional results after transanal repair versus open techniques may not be superior and even associated with additional problems due to extensive stretching by retractors to gain visualization with subsequent damage to the anal canal. To date, there has been no randomized controlled study evaluating the long-term outcome of OPEN surgery compared with L-TERPT/TERPT. Therefore, the present review could only focus on retrospective studies with a high variability of follow-up periods and definition of outcome parameters. We focused on long-term outcome in HD patients operated with conventional transabdominal pull-through (OPEN) compared with transanal endorectal pull-through with or without laparoscopy (L-TERPT/TERPT) using four major outcome parameters: constipation, incontinence, enterocolitis and anastomotic stricture. Constipation: The incidence of postpull-through constipation in the current literature ranges from 0 to 59%. Suspected causes include abnormal motility of the pulled-through segment and abnormal function of the internal anal sphincter due to the underlying disease or preceding surgery. However, most authors describe an improvement of constipation in late childhood. Our systematic review revealed postoperative constipation rates of up to 59%. Furthermore, it confirms previous reports on a higher incidence of postoperative constipation after OPEN surgery when compared with L-TERPT/TERPT. Soiling/Incontinence: Most patients with HD have been reported to suffer from soiling which remains the major cause of psychological and social problems in these patients. Besides constipation, fecal soiling/incontinence has therefore been identified as the most relevant long-term complication after any type of surgery for HD. Three major causes of soiling have been described: abnormal sphincter function, abnormal sensation, and “pseudoincontinence.” The latter is caused by either severe constipation with fecal overflow or hypermotility of the pulled-through colon. Levitt et al postulate that sphincter function and sensation may be damaged during the primary repair, and that the colonic motility is substantially affected by an operation for HD. However, it is noteworthy that patients with HD lack rectoanal relaxation reflex not only after but also before surgery. Therefore, it remains unclear to what extent surgical dissection of the rectum compromises relevant nerval structures responsible for anal canal sensa-tion, sphincter competence, and colonic motility. There is an ongoing debate on whether the incidence of soiling/incontinence is associated with the operative technique. Some authors suggest that extensive mechani-cal stretching during L-TERPT/TERPT by retractors can damage the anal canal and might therefore lead to a higher incidence of incontinent HD patients. However, our data do not reflect these concerns as it shows that soiling/incontinence occurs significantly more often after OPEN compared with L-TERPT/TERPT surgery. The higher incidence of soiling/incontinence in the OPEN surgery group may derive from deep pelvic dissection affecting pelvic nerves and therefore compromising both sphincter function and sensa-tion. Enterocolitis: Hirschsprung-associated enterocolitis (HAEC) represents an-other major postoperative complication and is the most common cause of death in children with HD. The patho-genesis of HAEC is still unknown. Several risk factors for HAEC have been identified including diagnosis at young age, anastomotic stricture, and malnutrition. Some authors report that obstruction at the level of the anus leading to intestinal stasis may play a major role in HAEC pathogenesis. The potential reasons for intestinal stasis include a spastic or long cuff, presuming that a shorter cuff might help to reduce postoperative enterocolitis. However, as HAEC may occur both before and after surgery for HD, the high incidence of HAEC cannot be explained by partial obstruction alone. We did not find a significant difference in the incidence of enterocolitis after OPEN surgery compared with L-TERPT/TERPT. This may indicate that HAEC is rather part of the underlying pathology of HD than a result of a particular surgical technique. Anastomotic Stricture: Multiple risk factors for anastomotic stricture including anastomotic ischemia, anastomotic leakage, and cuff ischemia have been described. Various surgical techniques were suggested to prevent stricture formation, such as an oblique coloanal anastomosis reported by Swenson. The studies analyzed in this review showed no significant difference in the incidence of anastomotic stricture after OPEN surgery compared with L-TERPT/TERPT surgery. Discussion: Although the present review of the recent literature revealed a higher incidence of constipation and soiling/incontinence after OPEN surgery compared with L-TERPT/TERPT, these data need to be carefully interpreted. The following limitations of the present analysis and validity of the data on the long-term outcome in the current literature may be discussed: • There was a lack of uniform definitions of outcome parameters after surgery for HD such as constipation, soiling, incontinence, enterocolitis, and stricture. • In a very few studies, standardized scores to describe endpoints were used. • L-TERPT and TERPT were analyzed as one group, which is due to the difficulty to distinguish whether laparoscopy was used for biopsies only or for dissection of the rectum. A comprehensive description of the surgical technique was lacking in numerous reports. • The OPEN surgery group consisted of several pull-through techniques such as Soave, Swenson, Duhamel, and Rehbein which might have led to a high variability of results. • The OPEN group was comparable to the L-TERPT/TERPT group in terms of “age at surgery” and “group size” but the follow-up period was significantly longer. As the functional results tend to be more favorable with increasing age, the high rate of constipation and soiling in the OPEN group is remarkable. • Comparative, randomized studies evaluating outcome of OPEN surgery versus L-TERPT/TERPT were not available for this review. Therefore, the validity of the data and level of evidence of the present analysis is limited. Conclusion: Functional outcome of different surgical techniques for HD is highly variable. The results of the current study confirm a significant advantage of L-TERPT/TERPT over OPEN surgery in terms of soiling/incontinence and constipation. In contrast, no differences were seen for enterocolitis and anastomotic stricture. Several limitations to this systematic review such as the different quality of studies and small cohort sizes need to be considered when interpreting these data. Moreover, only few authors used standardized scores to assess functional outcome. Hence, prospective, randomized, multicenter trials are urgently needed to overcome this weakness of the available reports in current literature.""

* Reasoning: The scientific quality of the included studies was assessed and documented using the Oxford system.
* Response: [Yes]

A8. Was the scientific quality of the included studies used appropriately in formulating conclusions? The results of the methodological rigor and scientific quality should be considered in the analysis and the conclusions of the review, and explicitly stated in formulating recommendations. Note: Might say something such as “the results should be interpreted with caution due to poor quality of included studies.” Cannot score “yes” for this question if scored “no” for question A7.

* Quote: ""The evidence was graded and the recommendations classified based on the Oxford system.""
* Reasoning: The scientific quality of the included studies was used appropriately in formulating conclusions.
* Response: [Yes]

A9. Were the methods used to combine the findings of studies appropriate? For the pooled results, a test should be done to ensure the studies were combinable, to assess their homogeneity (i.e., Chi-squared test for homogeneity, I2 ). If heterogeneity exists a random effects model should be used and/or the clinical appropriateness of combining should be taken into consideration (i.e., is it sensible to combine?). Note: Indicate “yes” if they mention or describe heterogeneity, i.e., if they explain that they cannot pool because of heterogeneity/variability between interventions.

* Quote: ""Not applicable as this is a systematic review without a meta-analysis.""
* Reasoning: The methods used to combine the findings of studies are not applicable in this systematic review without a meta-analysis.
* Response: [NA]

A10. Was the likelihood of publication bias assessed? An assessment of publication bias should include a combination of graphical aids (e.g., funnel plot, other available tests) and/or statistical tests (e.g., Egger regression test, Hedges-Olken). Note: If no test values or funnel plot included, score “no”. Score “yes” if mentions that publication bias could not be assessed because there were fewer than 10 included studies.

* Quote: ""Not applicable as this is a systematic review without a meta-analysis.""
* Reasoning: The likelihood of publication bias is not applicable in this systematic review without a meta-analysis.
* Response: [NA]

A11. Was the conflict of interest included? Potential sources of support should be clearly acknowledged in both the systematic review and the included studies. Note: To get a “yes,” must indicate source of funding or support for the systematic review AND for each of the included studies.

* ""Background/purpose: Interval appendicectomy (IA) is commonly performed after successful nonoperative treatment of appendix mass (AM); although, this approach has recently been challenged. We systematically reviewed the pediatric literature with regard to the justification for this practice. Methods: Using a defined search strategy, studies were identified and data were extracted independently by 2 reviewers. Incidences of recurrent appendicitis, complications after IA, and carcinoid tumor were estimated accounting for interstudy heterogeneity. Cost and length of stay of IA were analyzed. Results: Three studies (127 cases) reporting routine nonsurgical treatment were identified; all were retrospective. There was marked interstudy heterogeneity and variable follow-up. After successful nonoperative treatment of AM, the risk of recurrent appendicitis is 20.5% (95% confidence interval [CI], 14.3%-28.4%). The incidence of complications after IA (23 studies, n = 1247) is 3.4% (95% CI, 2.2-5.1), and the incidence of carcinoid tumor found at IA (15 studies, n = 955) is 0.9% (95% CI, 0.5-1.8). No reports compared costs. Mean length of stay for IA is 3 days (range, 1-30 days). Conclusions: Prospective studies comparing routine IA with nonoperative treatment without IA in children are lacking. Available data suggest that 80% of children with AM may not need IA. A prospective study to evaluate the natural history of this condition compared with the morbidity and costs of IA is warranted."" (abstract)

* ""Background/purpose: Interval appendicectomy (IA) is commonly performed after successful nonoperative treatment of appendix mass (AM); although, this approach has recently been challenged. We systematically reviewed the pediatric literature with regard to the justification for this practice. Methods: Using a defined search strategy, studies were identified and data were extracted independently by 2 reviewers. Incidences of recurrent appendicitis, complications after IA, and carcinoid tumor were estimated accounting for interstudy heterogeneity. Cost and length of stay of IA were analyzed. Results: Three studies (127 cases) reporting routine nonsurgical treatment were identified; all were retrospective. There was marked interstudy heterogeneity and variable follow-up. After successful nonoperative treatment of AM, the risk of recurrent appendicitis is 20.5% (95% confidence interval [CI], 14.3%-28.4%). The incidence of complications after IA (23 studies, n = 1247) is 3.4% (95% CI, 2.2-5.1), and the incidence of carcinoid tumor found at IA (15 studies, n = 955) is 0.9% (95% CI, 0.5-1.8). No reports compared costs. Mean length of stay for IA is 3 days (range, 1-30 days). Conclusions: Prospective studies comparing routine IA with nonoperative treatment without IA in children are lacking. Available data suggest that 80% of children with AM may not need IA. A prospective study to evaluate the natural history of this condition compared with the morbidity and costs of IA is warranted."" (abstract)
