1. Eligibility criteria:

   <span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;A highly pragmatic approach to eligibility criteria would be to include in the trial anyone with the condition of interest who is likely to be a candidate for the intervention if it was being provided in usual care for this condition.&quot;</span> [Loudon 2015 shortened.txt]

2. The text describes the eligibility criteria for the trial, which is a pragmatic approach to eligibility criteria. The trial includes anyone with the condition of interest who is likely to be a candidate for the intervention if it was being provided in usual care for this condition. The text also mentions some exclusion criteria, such as excluding people not known or shown to be highly adherent to the intervention and excluding people using tests or measures that are not used or available in usual care. These exclusion criteria reduce the pragmatic nature of the trial, but the overall approach to eligibility criteria is still pragmatic.

4. The text describes the recruitment process for the trial, which is a pragmatic approach to recruitment. The most extremely pragmatic approach to recruitment would be to do this in usual care so that only the people who attend a clinic with the condition of interest are recruited after they present on their own behalf without any overt recruitment effort. The text also mentions some less pragmatic recruitment strategies, such as searching medical record systems for eligible participants and then mailing invitation letters and media advertising campaigns. These less pragmatic recruitment strategies reduce the pragmatic nature of the trial, but the overall approach to recruitment is still pragmatic.

6. The text describes the setting for the trial, which is a pragmatic approach to setting. The most extremely pragmatic approach to setting would be to do the trial in an identical setting to which you intend the results to be applied. The text also mentions some less pragmatic setting options, such as selecting participating centres from among only specialist or academic centres when the trial is intended to be applicable to all types of practice or clinic treating the condition of interest and running the trial in a single centre. These less pragmatic setting options reduce the pragmatic nature of the trial, but the overall approach to setting is still pragmatic.

A highly pragmatic design would aim to slot the intervention into the usual organization of care for the condition of interest, making use of no more than the existing healthcare staff and resources in that setting. The text also mentions some less pragmatic organization strategies, such as increasing the number of healthcare or other professionals available to deliver the intervention over and above the levels available in usual care and providing significant levels of additional training to increase the expertise of healthcare professionals.

10. The text describes the flexibility of the intervention delivery in the trial, which is a pragmatic approach to flexibility (delivery). In PRECIS-2, trialists wishing to conduct more pragmatic trials are encouraged to think about how the intervention will be implemented post-trial in the setting where the results are expected to be applied. The text also mentions some less pragmatic intervention delivery strategies, such as a highly specified, protocol driven intervention and having measures in place to monitor the compliance of those delivering the intervention with the protocol and measures to address poor compliance. These less pragmatic intervention delivery strategies reduce the pragmatic nature of the trial, but the overall approach to flexibility (delivery) is still pragmatic.

It is important that trialists focused on applicability consider how probable it is that there will be uptake of the intervention being tested and how recipients will engage with it in the setting in which it will be later applied. The text also mentions some less pragmatic intervention adherence strategies, such as having a trial pre-screening stage where patients are evaluated for adherence with the intervention and withdrawing patients from the trial if their adherence with the intervention drops below some specified level. These less pragmatic intervention adherence strategies reduce the pragmatic nature of the trial, but the overall approach to flexibility (adherence) is still pragmatic.

The choice of primary outcome is a crucial trial design decision, and a pragmatic approach would be to select an outcome that is of obvious importance from the patient’s perspective. The text also mentions some less pragmatic primary outcome strategies, such as choosing a surrogate outcome and having central adjudication of the outcome or using an assessment that needs special training or tests not normally used in usual care.

from the LLM prompt briefing</span> (mean similarity 99.9%) - were
instructions quoted (ok) or examples (unwanted beahviour)?</i></p>
<pre>
1. Eligibility criteria: Who is selected to participate in the trial?

> <span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;A highly pragmatic approach to eligibility criteria would be to include in the trial anyone with the condition of interest who is likely to be a candidate for the intervention if it was being provided in usual care for this condition. So, if in usual care the intervention would likely be used for children, elderly people, people with a range of comorbidities, and people with a probable diagnosis rather than, say, a laboratory confirmed diagnosis, then all of these groups should be in the trial too.&quot;</span>

> <span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Many things could reduce the score, but some examples include excluding people not known or shown to be highly adherent to the intervention, excluding people using tests or measures that are not used or available in usual care, excluding people not expected to be highly responsive to the intervention, excluding people who would be likely to receive the intervention in usual care but inclusion in the trial is considered too difficult because of challenges unrelated to the delivery of the intervention. Children, people over the age of 65, and pregnant women are good examples of people commonly excluded because of anticipated difficulties of gaining ethical approval rather than whether they would be likely to receive an intervention in usual care.&quot;</span>

2. Reasoning:

The trial included participants with a wide range of ages, disabilities, and comorbidities, which aligns with the pragmatic approach to eligibility criteria. The trial did not exclude participants based on adherence, tests or measures not used in usual care, or low responsiveness to the intervention. However, the trial did exclude participants who were not expected to receive the intervention in usual care, such as those with a laboratory confirmed diagnosis.

3. Score: [4]

1. Recruitment: How are participants recruited into the trial?

> <span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The most extreme pragmatic approach to recruitment would be to do this in usual care so that only the people who attend a clinic with the condition of interest are recruited after they present on their own behalf without any overt recruitment effort. A highly pragmatic approach to trial design would also recruit from more than one clinic as an explicit way of increasing applicability of the trial results.&quot;</span>

> <span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Recruiting through usual appointments at a diverse range of clinics is likely to score at or close to 5 on the PRECIS-2 scale.&quot;</span>

2. Reasoning:

The trial recruited participants from multiple clinics and through usual appointments, which aligns with the pragmatic approach to recruitment. The trial did not use additional recruitment strategies such as media advertising campaigns or incentives.

3. Score: [5]

1. Setting: Where is the trial being done?

> <span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The most extremely pragmatic approach to setting would be to do the trial in an identical setting to which you intend the results to be applied. Such a trial is likely to score at or close to 5 on PRECIS-2.&quot;</span>

> <span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Approaches to setting that are likely to reduce the PRECIS-2 score include Selecting participating centres from among only specialist or academic centres when the trial is intended to be applicable to all types of practice or clinic treating the condition of interest. Running the trial in a single centre. It is rare that a trial is done with the intention that its results should apply to only that single centre.&quot;</span>

2. Reasoning:

The trial was conducted in multiple clinics, which aligns with the pragmatic approach to setting. The trial did not select participating centers from only specialist or academic centers or run the trial in a single center.

3. Score: [5]

1. Organization: What expertise and resources are needed to deliver the intervention?

> <span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;A highly pragmatic design would aim to slot the intervention into the usual organisation of care for the condition of interest, making use of no more than the existing healthcare staff and resources in that setting.&quot;</span>

> <span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The PRECIS-2 organisation score will be reduced to the degree trialists make changes in how care is delivered compared with the usual recipients and care delivery. For example, the trial team may, in the intervention arm, provide additional training to staff or provide additional staff so that the intervention can be delivered. Patients who would normally be seen in primary care may be seen by specialists in secondary care instead, or they may receive additional expensive diagnostic procedures unavailable in usual care. The success or otherwise of the trial then depends on resources unavailable in usual care, reducing applicability. If these additional resources are essential to the effectiveness of the intervention they should be considered to be part of the intervention and be specified in the part of the protocol describing the intervention.&quot;</span>

2. Reasoning:

The trial did not provide additional training to staff or additional staff to deliver the intervention. The trial did not see patients in a different setting than usual care or provide additional diagnostic procedures unavailable in usual care.

3. Score: [5]

1. Flexibility (delivery): How should the intervention be delivered?

> <span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in prompt (Similarity 98.7%):

In PRECIS-2, trialists wishing to conduct more pragmatic trials are encouraged to think about how the intervention will be implemented post-trial in the setting where the results are expected to be applied.

> <span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;As delivery flexibility is reduced, the trial moves towards a more explanatory approach in this domain. Approaches to delivery flexibility that are likely to reduce the PRECIS-2 score include A highly specified, protocol driven intervention. Having measures in place to monitor the compliance of those delivering the intervention (such as doctors) with the protocol and measures (up to and including exclusion) to address poor compliance.&quot;</span>

2. Reasoning:

The trial did not specify the details of how to implement the intervention and left it up to providers, which aligns with the pragmatic approach to delivery flexibility. The trial did not have measures in place to monitor the compliance of those delivering the intervention or exclude participants for poor compliance.

3. Score: [5]

1. Flexibility (adherence): What measures are in place to ensure participants adhere to the intervention?

> <span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;It is important that trialists focused on applicability consider how probable it is that there will be uptake of the intervention being tested and how recipients will engage with it in the setting in which it will be later applied. A highly pragmatic design approach would allow for full flexibility in how end user recipients engage with the intervention. In usual care, health professionals encourage patients to take medication or follow therapy as best they can, and such encouragement would not count against a pragmatic design; if it also happens in usual care, allowing it in the trial is a pragmatic design decision.&quot;</span>

> <span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;As flexibility for recipients is reduced, the trial moves towards a more explanatory approach on this domain. Approaches to recipient flexibility that are likely to reduce the PRECIS-2 score include Having a trial pre-screening stage where patients are evaluated for adherence with the intervention (such as dose, dosing schedule, attendance at therapy sessions). Patients judged to not be adherent are excluded.&quot;</span>

2. Reasoning:

The trial allowed for full flexibility in how end user recipients engaged with the intervention, which aligns with the pragmatic approach to flexibility (adherence). The trial did not have a trial pre-screening stage where patients were evaluated for adherence and excluded if they were not adherent.

3. Score: [5]

1. Follow-up: How closely are participants followed up?

> <span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;This domain encourages trialists to think about follow-up with regard to the setting where the results will be applied. The most pragmatic position with regard to follow-up would be to have no more follow-up of recipients than would be the case in usual care. Indeed, the most extreme position is to have no follow-up contact at all with recipients and to obtain outcome data by other means (such as electronic medical records or other usual data to measure mortality or hospital admissions). Trials that have no more follow-up than is normal in usual care and have minimal additional data collection (or use data obtained from administrative or clinical record systems without direct contact with the participant) would be likely to score at or close to 5 on PRECIS-2.&quot;</span>

> <span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;As follow-up becomes more intense, the trial becomes more explanatory and the PRECIS-2 score will decrease. Follow-up approaches that are likely to reduce the PRECIS-2 score include Follow-up visits that are more frequent than would typically occur under usual care. Unscheduled follow-up visits are triggered by a primary outcome event. Unscheduled follow-up visits are triggered by an intervening event that is likely to lead to the primary outcome event. Patients are contacted if they fail to keep trial appointments. This would not reduce the PRECIS-2 score if this was also done in usual care.&quot;</span>

2. Reasoning:

The trial had no more follow-up than is normal in usual care and had minimal additional data collection, which aligns with the pragmatic approach to follow-up. The trial did not have unscheduled follow-up visits triggered by a primary outcome event or an intervening event, and did not contact patients if they failed to keep trial appointments unless it was also done in usual care.

3. Score: [5]

1. Primary outcome: How relevant is it to participants?

> <span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The choice of primary outcome is a crucial trial design decision, and a pragmatic approach would be to select an outcome that is of obvious importance from the patient’s perspective. Post-trial, an outcome selected using a pragmatic approach would also be relevant to commissioners of care, the people who decide whether to implement the intervention on the basis of its results. For example, an intervention that aims to reduce falls in elderly people living independently in the community should have as its primary outcome the number of falls in the elderly living independently in the community. This outcome has meaning to patients, their relatives and friends, healthcare professionals, and policymakers. Measures of, say, bone density, muscle strength, or functional ability are distant from the key question of whether the intervention prevents elderly people falling in their own homes. Trials that choose outcomes of obvious importance to patients, and measure them in a way that is the same or similar to the way they are measured in usual care would be likely to score at or close to 5 on PRECIS-2.&quot;</span>

> <span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;As the primary outcome becomes less recognisably important to patients, or is assessed on criteria seldom used in usual care, the trial becomes more explanatory and the PRECIS-2 score will decrease. Approaches to the primary outcomes that are likely to reduce the PRECIS-2 score include Choosing a surrogate outcome (such as blood test) that the intervention is expected to have a direct effect on, or the use of safety climate surveys rather than medical error events or near miss events. Having central adjudication of the outcome or using an assessment that needs special training or tests not normally used in usual care. Choosing an outcome that is important but mainly to providers, typically because it is a physiological outcome considered useful in treatment planning and monitoring.&quot;</span>

2. Reasoning:

The trial chose a primary outcome that is of obvious importance to patients and measured it in a way that is the same or similar to the way it is measured in usual care, which aligns with the pragmatic approach to primary outcome. The trial did not choose a surrogate outcome, have central adjudication of the outcome, or use an assessment that needs special training or tests not normally used in usual care.

1. Primary analysis: To what extent are all data included?

> <span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Most trials are a superiority design so the most pragmatic approach with regard to the analysis would be to make no special allowance in the analysis for non-adherence, practice variability, etc. In other words, the pragmatic approach to the analysis would typically be an intention-to-treat analysis using all available data. This sort of analysis would score at or close to 5 on PRECIS-2. (Non-inferiority and equivalence trials are usually contrary to intention-to-treat analysis.)&quot;</span>

> <span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Approaches to the primary analysis that are likely to reduce the PRECIS-2 score include Excluding non-compliant recipients (per protocol analysis) Analyse recipients to treatment received instead of treatment randomised (as treated analysis) Excluding data from non-adherent providers Excluding data from trial sites or providers who recruit below expected volume.&quot;</span>

2. Reasoning:

The trial used an intention-to-treat analysis using all available data, which aligns with the pragmatic approach to primary analysis. The trial did not exclude non-compliant recipients, analyze recipients to treatment received instead of treatment randomized, exclude data from non-adherent providers, or exclude data from trial sites or providers who recruit below expected volume.

3. Score: [5]

---

In summary, the trial scored high on most of the PRECIS-2 domains, indicating that it is a pragmatic trial. The trial included a wide range of participants, recruited participants from multiple clinics and through usual appointments, conducted the trial in multiple clinics, did not provide additional training to staff or additional staff to deliver the intervention, left the details of how to implement the intervention up to providers, allowed for full flexibility in how end user recipients engaged with the intervention, had no more follow-up than is normal in usual care and had minimal additional data collection, chose a primary outcome that is of obvious importance to patients and measured it in a way that is the same or similar to the way it is measured in usual care, and used an intention-to-treat analysis using all available data. The trial did not score as high on the eligibility criteria domain because it excluded participants who were not expected to receive the intervention in usual care, such as those with a laboratory confirmed diagnosis.</pre>

1. Eligibility criteria: Who is selected to participate in the trial?

The inclusion criteria were diagnosis of PPMS or SPMS, Internet access and some level of distress determined by a score of 3 or greater on the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12). Exclusion criteria were severe cognitive impairment, as determined by a score of 20 or smaller on the Telephone Interview for Cognitive Status-Modified (TICS-M) and high suicide risk, as assessed by a score of 20 or greater on the Clinical Outcome of Routine Evaluation (CORE-10). This suggests a relatively pragmatic approach to eligibility criteria, as the trial includes patients with PPMS or SPMS, which is a progressive form of MS, and excludes only those with severe cognitive impairment or high suicide risk. Score: [4]

2. Recruitment: How are participants recruited into the trial?

The trial recruited potential participants through adverts on the MS Society website and from National Health Service (NHS) MS centres across the UK. Recruitment took place between December 2012 and May 2013. This suggests a relatively pragmatic approach to recruitment, as the trial uses existing resources and networks to recruit participants. Score: [4]

3. Setting: Where is the trial being done?

The study was approved by London City Road and Hampstead Research Ethics Committee (12/LO/1394) and registered at the Current Controlled Trials database (ISRCTN93263909). All participants completed written informed consent. This suggests a relatively pragmatic approach to setting, as the trial is conducted in a real-world setting with appropriate ethical oversight and informed consent. Score: [5]

4. Organisation: What expertise and resources are needed to deliver the intervention?

The treatment phase took place between February 2013 and July 2013. We delivered the programme in eight hour-long sessions over an eight-week period via Skype video conferences. Participants were sent a headset and webcam together with instructions of how to set up Skype. This suggests a relatively pragmatic approach to organisation, as the trial uses existing technology and resources to deliver the intervention. Score: [5]

5. Flexibility (delivery): How should the intervention be delivered?

The format and manual for the mindfulness group, including length of sessions and individual mindfulness practices, were developed in partnership with patients with MS through initial experimental case studies. The content of the manual was adapted from the Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) course book. This suggests a relatively pragmatic approach to flexibility (delivery), as the trial adapts the intervention to the needs and preferences of the target population. Score: [5]

6. Flexibility (adherence): What measures are in place to ensure participants adhere to the intervention?

Feedback from people with progressive MS who took part in the series of experimental case-studies (n = 6, Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) range = 6.5--7.5) emphasised that we needed to account for compromised concentration, fatigue, mobility and problems with sitting in one posture during mindfulness home practices. We shortened the daily home practice to 10--20 minutes and provided audio compact discs (CDs) produced specifically for this course. This suggests a relatively pragmatic approach to flexibility (adherence), as the trial adapts the intervention to the needs and preferences of the target population. Score: [5]

7. Follow-up: How closely are participants followed up?

Participants completed standardised questionnaires to measure mood, impact of MS and symptom severity, quality of life and service costs at baseline, post-intervention and three-month follow-up. Qualitative interviews (n = 15) were conducted with people who took part in the mindfulness groups on their experiences of the intervention. These will be reported in detail elsewhere. This suggests a relatively pragmatic approach to follow-up, as the trial uses standardised questionnaires and qualitative interviews to assess the outcomes of the intervention. Score: [5]

8. Primary outcome: How relevant is it to participants?

The primary outcome was the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ) score, which measures general levels of distress. The GHQ is uncontaminated by the experience of MS-related somatic symptoms and is the most treatment-responsive measure of psychological distress in MS. This suggests a relatively pragmatic approach to primary outcome, as the trial focuses on a relevant and important outcome for the target population. Score: [5]

9. Primary analysis: To what extent are all data included?

Outcome analysis was conducted using Stata 12.1. To compare group demographic and clinical characterisitics at baseline, we used a binomial test for equal proportions between groups for categorical variables and an independent t-test for equal means between groups for continuous variables. Treatment effects on the primary and secondary outcomes were estimated using linear mixed modelling where the outcome variables at the two post-intervention time points were the dependent variable. This suggests a relatively pragmatic approach to primary analysis, as the trial uses appropriate statistical methods to analyse the data. Score: [5]</pre>

> <span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;A highly pragmatic approach to eligibility criteria would be to include in the trial anyone with the condition of interest who is likely to be a candidate for the intervention if it was being provided in usual care for this condition. So, if in usual care the intervention would likely be used for children, elderly people, people with a range of comorbidities, and people with a probable diagnosis rather than, say, a laboratory confirmed diagnosis, then all of these groups should be in the trial too.&quot;</span>

> A highly pragmatic approach to eligibility criteria would be to include in the trial anyone with the condition of interest who is likely to be a candidate for the intervention if it was being provided in usual care for this condition.

> The most extreme pragmatic approach to recruitment would be to do this in usual care so that only the people who attend a clinic with the condition of interest are recruited after they present on their own behalf without any overt recruitment effort.

> The most pragmatic position with regard to setting would be to do the trial in an identical setting to which you intend the results to be applied.

2. Recruitment: How are participants recruited into the trial?

> The most pragmatic approach to recruitment would be to recruit from more than one clinic as an explicit way of increasing applicability of the trial results.

> Recruiting through usual appointments at a diverse range of clinics is likely to score at or close to 5 on the PRECIS-2 scale.

> The most extremely pragmatic approach to setting would be to do the trial in an identical setting to which you intend the results to be applied.

3. Setting: Where is the trial being done?

> The most pragmatic approach to setting would be to do the trial in an identical setting to which you intend the results to be applied.

> Even settings that seem rather restrictive could still be a highly pragmatic design choice if this setting is the usual care setting where patients are treated for the particular health condition.

> Approaches to setting that are likely to reduce the PRECIS-2 score include Selecting participating centres from among only specialist or academic centres when the trial is intended to be applicable to all types of practice or clinic treating the condition of interest.

4. Organisation: What expertise and resources are needed to deliver the intervention?

> A highly pragmatic design would aim to slot the intervention into the usual organisation of care for the condition of interest, making use of no more than the existing healthcare staff and resources in that setting.

> Sometimes a change to how care is organised is itself the intervention being evaluated, and the difference between the trial and usual care is clear.

> The PRECIS-2 organisation score will be reduced to the degree trialists make changes in how care is delivered compared with the usual recipients and care delivery.

5. Flexibility (delivery): How should the intervention be delivered?

> In PRECIS-2, trialists wishing to conduct more pragmatic trials are encouraged to think about how the intervention will be implemented post-trial in the setting where the results are likely to be applied.

> The methodology of how to deliver an intervention is not rigidly prescriptive in the protocol.

> As delivery flexibility is reduced, the trial moves towards a more explanatory approach in this domain.

6. Flexibility (adherence): What measures are in place to ensure participants adhere to the intervention?

> A highly pragmatic design approach would allow for full flexibility in how end user recipients engage with the intervention.

> In usual care, health professionals encourage patients to take medication or follow therapy as best they can, and such encouragement would not count against a pragmatic design.

> As flexibility for recipients is reduced, the trial moves towards a more explanatory approach on this domain.

7. Follow-up: How closely are participants followed up?

> The most pragmatic position with regard to follow-up would be to have no more follow-up of recipients than would be the case in usual care.

> The most extreme position is to have no follow-up contact at all with recipients and to obtain outcome data by other means (such as electronic medical records or other usual data to measure mortality or hospital admissions).

> If the follow-up is done in this way, it is unlikely to have an impact on engagement or response to the treatment, and so such a follow-up approach would be viewed as pragmatic and rated at or close to 5.

8. Primary outcome: How relevant is it to participants?

> The most pragmatic position with regard to primary outcome would be to select an outcome that is of obvious importance from the patient’s perspective.

> Post-trial, an outcome selected using a pragmatic approach would also be relevant to commissioners of care, the people who decide whether to implement the intervention on the basis of its results.

> As the primary outcome becomes less recognisably important to patients, or is assessed on criteria seldom used in usual care, the trial becomes more explanatory and the PRECIS-2 score will decrease.

9. Primary analysis: To what extent are all data included?

> The most pragmatic approach with regard to the analysis would be to make no special allowance in the analysis for non-adherence, practice variability, etc.

> The intention-to-treat analysis has recently also become the norm for superiority trials taking a more explanatory design approach.

> Approaches to the primary analysis that are likely to reduce the PRECIS-2 score include Excluding non-compliant recipients (per protocol analysis) and Analyse recipients to treatment received instead of treatment randomised (as treated analysis).

For each domain, the reasoning is based on the quotes provided. The scores are given in square brackets.

<pre>
1. Eligibility criteria: Who is selected to participate in the trial?

> <span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;A highly pragmatic approach to eligibility criteria would be to include in the trial anyone with the condition of interest who is likely to be a candidate for the intervention if it was being provided in usual care for this condition.&quot;</span>

> <span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Excluding people not known or shown to be highly adherent to the intervention.&quot;</span>

> <span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Excluding people whose adherence and follow-up may pose difficulties, whether because of social disadvantage, personal circumstances, or illness (such as homelessness, substance misuse, mental health problems, or poor motivation).&quot;</span>

2. The trial recruited participants with relapsing-remitting MS who had difficulty walking, and excluded those with benign or progressive/relapsing types of MS, serious unstable medical conditions, concurrent conditions, or who had participated in a PRT program in the 6 months before training started. The trial also excluded those who did not fulfill inclusion criteria, had an Ambulation Index score <2 or >4, were doing strength training, had a recent acute exacerbation, or were not available.

3. Score: [4] - The trial is relatively pragmatic in its eligibility criteria, as it includes participants with a specific type of MS who have difficulty walking, and excludes those with serious medical conditions or concurrent conditions. However, the trial also excludes those who do not fulfill inclusion criteria, have an Ambulation Index score <2 or >4, are doing strength training, had a recent acute exacerbation, or are not available, which reduces its pragmatism.

1. Recruitment: How are participants recruited into the trial?

> <span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The most extreme pragmatic approach to recruitment would be to do this in usual care so that only the people who attend a clinic with the condition of interest are recruited after they present on their own behalf without any overt recruitment effort.&quot;</span>

> <span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Recruiting through usual appointments at a diverse range of clinics is likely to score at or close to 5 on the PRECIS-2 scale.&quot;</span>

> <span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Additional recruitment approaches that could potentially reduce the PRECIS-2 score include media advertising campaigns such as television and radio advertisements, newspaper advertisements, flyers, websites, press releases, letters to the editor, interviews with the chief investigator on television or radio.&quot;</span>

2. The trial recruited participants through a statewide organization providing education and support to people with MS, and a large specialist MS outpatient clinic. Recruitment information flyers were sent by mail to all potential participants registered on the mailing lists of both organizations. Volunteers were asked to contact one of the researchers by telephone, during which volunteers were screened to ensure they satisfied the inclusion criteria.

3. Score: [3] - The trial is moderately pragmatic in its recruitment, as it recruits participants through a statewide organization and a large specialist MS outpatient clinic, which is similar to how participants would be recruited in usual care. However, the trial also uses telephone screening to ensure volunteers satisfy the inclusion criteria, which reduces its pragmatism.

1. Setting: Where is the trial being done?

> <span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The most extremely pragmatic approach to setting would be to do the trial in an identical setting to which you intend the results to be applied.&quot;</span>

> <span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Approaches to setting that are likely to reduce the PRECIS-2 score include Selecting participating centres from among only specialist or academic centres when the trial is intended to be applicable to all types of practice or clinic treating the condition of interest. Running the trial in a single centre. It is rare that a trial is done with the intention that its results should apply to only that single centre.&quot;</span>

2. The trial was conducted in four community gymnasiums in metropolitan and regional areas.

3. Score: [5] - The trial is highly pragmatic in its setting, as it is conducted in four community gymnasiums in metropolitan and regional areas, which is similar to where the intervention would be applied in usual care.

1. Organization: What expertise and resources are needed to deliver the intervention?

> <span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;A highly pragmatic design would aim to slot the intervention into the usual organisation of care for the condition of interest, making use of no more than the existing healthcare staff and resources in that setting.&quot;</span>

> <span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Organisational approaches that are likely to reduce the PRECIS-2 score include Increasing the number of healthcare or other professionals available to deliver the intervention over and above the levels available in usual care. Providing significant levels of additional training to increase the expertise of healthcare professionals. Requiring healthcare professionals to have some minimum level of experience, defined by length of time, in working with the intervention that is greater than would be the case in usual care. Requiring healthcare professionals to have a specialty certification that would not be considered essential to deliver the intervention in usual care.&quot;</span>

2. The trial provided participants with a logbook detailing each exercise, the weight lifted, the number of repetitions, and the number of sets completed. Each program was attended by a group of up to 12 participants, and they were supervised by up to three experienced trainers (physiotherapists and registered personal sports trainers). Each trainer directly supervised a sub-group of three or four participants. Each exercise session was completed in around 45 min, and at the end of each session there was a 30-min recovery period when the participants had refreshments and time to socialize.

3. Score: [5] - The trial is highly pragmatic in its organization, as it slots the intervention into the usual organization of care for the condition of interest, making use of existing healthcare staff and resources in that setting.

1. Flexibility (delivery): How should the intervention be delivered?

> <span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;In PRECIS-2, trialists wishing to conduct more pragmatic trials are encouraged to think about how the intervention will be implemented post-trial in the setting where the results are expected to be applied.&quot;</span>

> <span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;As delivery flexibility is reduced, the trial moves towards a more explanatory approach in this domain. Approaches to delivery flexibility that are likely to reduce the PRECIS-2 score include A highly specified, protocol driven intervention. Having measures in place to monitor the compliance of those delivering the intervention (such as doctors) with the protocol and measures (up to and including exclusion) to address poor compliance.&quot;</span>

2. The trial provided participants with a logbook detailing each exercise, the weight lifted, the number of repetitions, and the number of sets completed.

Each exercise session was completed in around 45 min, and at the end of each session there was a 30-min recovery period when the participants had refreshments and time to socialize.

3. Score: [5] - The trial is highly pragmatic in its flexibility of delivery, as it allows for full flexibility in how end user recipients engage with the intervention, and does not have a highly specified, protocol-driven intervention or measures in place to monitor the compliance of those delivering the intervention with the protocol.

---

1. Flexibility (adherence): What measures are in place to ensure participants adhere to the intervention?

> <span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;It is important that trialists focused on applicability consider how probable it is that there will be uptake of the intervention being tested and how recipients will engage with it in the setting in which it will be later applied.&quot;</span>

> <span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;As flexibility for recipients is reduced, the trial moves towards a more explanatory approach on this domain. Approaches to recipient flexibility that are likely to reduce the PRECIS-2 score include Having a trial pre-screening stage where patients are evaluated for adherence with the intervention (such as dose, dosing schedule, attendance at therapy sessions). Withdrawing patients from the trial if their adherence with the intervention drops below some specified level.&quot;</span>

2. The trial did not report any measures in place to ensure participants adhere to the intervention.

3. Score: [5] - The trial is highly pragmatic in its flexibility of adherence, as it does not have a trial pre-screening stage where patients are evaluated for adherence with the intervention or measures in place to withdraw patients from the trial if their adherence with the intervention drops below some specified level.

1. Follow-up: How closely are participants followed up?

> <span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;This domain encourages trialists to think about follow-up with regard to the setting where the results will be applied.&quot;</span>

> <span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Follow-up approaches that are likely to reduce the PRECIS-2 score include Follow-up visits that are more frequent than would typically occur under usual care. Unscheduled follow-up visits are triggered by a primary outcome event. Unscheduled follow-up visits are triggered by an intervening event that is likely to lead to the primary outcome event. Patients are contacted if they fail to keep trial appointments. This would not reduce the PRECIS-2 score if this was also done in usual care.&quot;</span>

2. The trial recorded outcome measurements at baseline, after 10 weeks to determine the immediate effects of the intervention, and after a further 12 weeks (week 22) to determine if any benefits from the program had been sustained. Outcome measures were taken by a registered physiotherapist blinded to group allocation, and experienced in musculoskeletal evaluation.

3. Score: [5] - The trial is highly pragmatic in its follow-up, as it has no more follow-up than would be the case in usual care, and minimal additional data collection.

---

1. Primary outcome: How relevant is it to participants?

> <span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The choice of primary outcome is a crucial trial design decision, and a pragmatic approach would be to select an outcome that is of obvious importance from the patient’s perspective.&quot;</span>

> <span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Approaches to the primary outcomes that are likely to reduce the PRECIS-2 score include Choosing a surrogate outcome (such as blood test) that the intervention is expected to have a direct effect on, or the use of safety climate surveys rather than medical error events or near miss events. Having central adjudication of the outcome or using an assessment that needs special training or tests not normally used in usual care.&quot;</span>

2. The trial's primary outcome was to determine the immediate effects of a supervised PRT program on walking function in people with relapsing-remitting MS who had difficulty walking.

3. Score: [5] - The trial is highly pragmatic in its primary outcome, as it selects an outcome that is of obvious importance from the patient's perspective.

1. Primary analysis: To what extent are all data included?

> <span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Most trials are a superiority design so the most pragmatic approach with regard to the analysis would be to make no special allowance in the analysis for non-adherence, practice variability, etc. In other words, the pragmatic approach to the analysis would typically be an intention-to-treat analysis using all available data.&quot;</span>

> <span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Approaches to the primary analysis that are likely to reduce the PRECIS-2 score include Excluding non-compliant recipients (per protocol analysis) Analyse recipients to treatment received instead of treatment randomised (as treated analysis) Excluding data from non-adherent providers Excluding data from trial sites or providers who recruit below expected volume.&quot;</span>

2. The trial used an intention-to-treat analysis, with all participants who were allocated and commenced their program included in analysis. Where data were missing, the carry forward technique was used.

3. Score: [5] - The trial is highly pragmatic in its primary analysis, as it uses an intention-to-treat analysis, with all participants who were allocated and commenced their program included in analysis, and where data were missing, the carry forward technique was used.</pre>

1. Eligibility criteria: Who is selected to participate in the trial?

> <span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;A highly pragmatic approach to eligibility criteria would be to include in the trial anyone with the condition of interest who is likely to be a candidate for the intervention if it was being provided in usual care for this condition. So, if in usual care the intervention would likely be used for children, elderly people, people with a range of comorbidities, and people with a probable diagnosis rather than, say, a laboratory confirmed diagnosis, then all of these groups should be in the trial too.&quot;</span>

> <span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Many things could reduce the score, but some examples include excluding people not known or shown to be highly adherent to the intervention, excluding people using tests or measures that are not used or available in usual care, excluding people not expected to be highly responsive to the intervention, excluding people who would be likely to receive the intervention in usual care but inclusion in the trial is considered too difficult because of challenges unrelated to the delivery of the intervention. Children, people over the age of 65, and pregnant women are good examples of people commonly excluded because of anticipated difficulties of gaining ethical approval rather than whether they would be likely to receive an intervention in usual care.&quot;</span>

2. The text describes the importance of including a wide range of participants in the trial to make it more pragmatic. The trial should include people who are likely to receive the intervention in usual care, including children, elderly people, and people with a range of comorbidities. Excluding people based on adherence, response to treatment, or availability of tests or measures not used in usual care would reduce the pragmatism of the trial.

Score: [5]


2. Recruitment: How are participants recruited into the trial?

The issue to consider here is whether these campaigns are being used simply to speed up recruitment, or because they are the only way to reach a dispersed population. In the latter case, if such campaigns would not be available in usual care then this trial recruitment route is more explanatory.&quot;</span>

3. The text describes the importance of recruiting participants in a pragmatic way, such as recruiting them in usual care settings and from multiple clinics. Additional recruitment strategies, such as media advertising campaigns, could potentially reduce the pragmatism of the trial if they are not used in usual care.

2. The text describes the importance of including in the trial anyone with the condition of interest who is likely to be a candidate for the intervention if it was being provided in usual care for this condition. This is a pragmatic approach, as it increases the generalizability of the trial results to the real-world setting. The text also mentions that excluding people not known or shown to be highly adherent to the intervention, using tests or measures that are not used or available in usual care, or excluding people not expected to be highly responsive to the intervention are all design choices that would reduce the pragmatism of the trial. The text also mentions that excluding people who would be likely to receive the intervention in usual care but inclusion in the trial is considered too difficult because of challenges unrelated to the delivery of the intervention is a pragmatic approach. The text also mentions that exclusion criteria for known safety issues would not generally reduce the PRECIS-2 score since such individuals would not be expected to get the intervention in usual care.

3. The text describes the importance of recruiting participants in the trial in the same way they would be recruited in usual care. This is a pragmatic approach, as it increases the generalizability of the trial results to the real-world setting. The text also mentions that recruiting in secondary care for an intervention that will mainly be used in primary care will ensure that the recruited patients are different in severity and treatment than the patients with this same condition in primary care; and so this will make the trial more explanatory and reduce the PRECIS 2 score. Additional recruitment approaches that could potentially reduce the PRECIS-2 score include searching medical record systems for eligible participants and then mailing invitation letters, media advertising campaigns such as television and radio advertisements, newspaper advertisements, flyers, websites, press releases, letters to the editor, interviews with the chief investigator on television or radio, and incentives such as cash payment, vouchers, travel costs, or childcare.

This is a pragmatic approach, as it increases the generalizability of the trial results to the real-world setting. The text also mentions that having a trial pre-screening stage where patients are evaluated for adherence with the intervention, withdrawing patients from the trial if their adherence with the intervention drops below some specified level, and having measures in place to monitor patient adherence with the protocol and measures to address poor adherence are all design choices that would reduce the pragmatism of the trial.

7. Follow-up: How closely are participants followed up?

> <span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;This domain encourages trialists to think about follow-up with regard to the setting where the results will be applied. The most pragmatic position with regard to follow-up would be to have no more follow-up of recipients than would be the case in usual care. Indeed, the most extreme position is to have no follow-up contact at all with recipients and to obtain outcome data by other means (such as electronic medical records or other usual data to measure mortality or hospital admissions). Trials that have no more follow-up than is normal in usual care and have minimal additional data collection (or use data obtained from administrative or clinical record systems without direct contact with the participant) would be likely to score at or close to 5 on PRECIS-2.&quot;</span>

1. Eligibility criteria:

   <span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;A highly pragmatic approach to eligibility criteria would be to include in the trial anyone with the condition of interest who is likely to be a candidate for the intervention if it was being provided in usual care for this condition.&quot;</span> [Loudon 2015 shortened.txt]

   <span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Excluding people not known or shown to be highly adherent to the intervention.&quot;</span> [Loudon 2015 shortened.txt]

2. The eligibility criteria domain assesses how similar the participants in the trial are to those who would receive the intervention in usual care. The first quote highlights the importance of including a diverse range of participants who would be likely to receive the intervention in usual care. The second and third quotes indicate that excluding participants based on adherence or personal circumstances would reduce the pragmatism of the trial. Based on this information, the trial appears to be relatively pragmatic in its eligibility criteria, as it aims to include a wide range of participants who would be likely to receive the intervention in usual care.

   <span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Recruiting in secondary care for an intervention that will mainly be used in primary care will ensure that the recruited patients are different in severity and treatment than the patients with this same condition in primary care; and so this will make the trial more explanatory and reduce the PRECIS 2 score.&quot;</span> [Loudon 2015 shortened.txt]

4. The recruitment domain assesses how participants are recruited into the trial. The first quote suggests that the most pragmatic approach to recruitment would be to recruit participants in usual care, without any overt recruitment effort. The second quote indicates that additional recruitment approaches, such as media advertising campaigns, could potentially reduce the pragmatism of the trial. The third quote suggests that recruiting in a different setting than where the intervention will be used could also reduce the pragmatism of the trial. Based on this information, the trial appears to be relatively pragmatic in its recruitment, as it aims to recruit participants in usual care without any overt recruitment effort.

1. Eligibility criteria: Who is selected to participate in the trial?

> <span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;A highly pragmatic approach to eligibility criteria would be to include in the trial anyone with the condition of interest who is likely to be a candidate for the intervention if it was being provided in usual care for this condition. So, if in usual care the intervention would likely be used for children, elderly people, people with a range of comorbidities, and people with a probable diagnosis rather than, say, a laboratory confirmed diagnosis, then all of these groups should be in the trial too.&quot;</span>

> <span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Many things could reduce the score, but some examples include excluding people not known or shown to be highly adherent to the intervention, excluding people using tests or measures that are not used or available in usual care, excluding people not expected to be highly responsive to the intervention, excluding people who would be likely to receive the intervention in usual care but inclusion in the trial is considered too difficult because of challenges unrelated to the delivery of the intervention. Children, people over the age of 65, and pregnant women are good examples of people commonly excluded because of anticipated difficulties of gaining ethical approval rather than whether they would be likely to receive an intervention in usual care.&quot;</span>

2. The eligibility criteria in this trial are highly pragmatic. The trial includes patients with relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) and low disability (Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score ≤ 4.0). The EDSS score is further quantified on-site by an experienced neurologist, prior to the start of CDT, in patients randomized to the intervention; and in those control patients who chose to receive CDT after study completion. The enrolment started February 2013 and ended April 2016. The follow-up started April 2013 (first 1-month assessment) and ended December 2016 (last 6-month assessment). Patients and support partners gave their written informed consent. CDT was given during three consecutive days in Zorghotel Spelderholt, Beekbergen, the Netherlands, a facility especially equipped for the accommodation of people with impaired health. The number of sessions, their schedule, and their duration are presented in the Appendix (see App 1).

3. Score: [5]


1. Recruitment: How are participants recruited into the trial?

> <span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The most extreme pragmatic approach to recruitment would be to do this in usual care so that only the people who attend a clinic with the condition of interest are recruited after they present on their own behalf without any overt recruitment effort. A highly pragmatic approach to trial design would also recruit from more than one clinic as an explicit way of increasing applicability of the trial results.&quot;</span>

> <span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Additional recruitment approaches that could potentially reduce the PRECIS-2 score include searching medical record systems for eligible participants and then mailing invitation letters, media advertising campaigns such as television and radio advertisements, newspaper advertisements, flyers, websites, press releases, letters to the editor, interviews with the chief investigator on television or radio, and incentives such as cash payment, vouchers, travel costs, or childcare.&quot;</span>

2. The recruitment in this trial is highly pragmatic. The patients were recruited from all over the Netherlands by the patient organisation NMSF, Rotterdam, the Netherlands. Interested patients were contacted by a registered nurse experienced in MS (MH) by phone to check diagnosis and eligibility criteria. The MS diagnosis was not confirmed by a neurologist. The criterion of EDSS ≤ 4.0 was checked by assessing whether the patient was self-sufficient and able to walk ≤500 meters without aid or rest.

1. Setting: Where is the trial being done?

> <span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The most extremely pragmatic approach to setting would be to do the trial in an identical setting to which you intend the results to be applied.

1. Organisation: What expertise and resources are needed to deliver the intervention?

> <span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;A highly pragmatic design would aim to slot the intervention into the usual organisation of care for the condition of interest, making use of no more than the existing healthcare staff and resources in that setting.&quot;</span>

> <span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The PRECIS-2 organisation score will be reduced to the degree trialists make changes in how care is delivered compared with the usual recipients and care delivery. For example, the trial team may, in the intervention arm, provide additional training to staff or provide additional staff so that the intervention can be delivered. Patients who would normally be seen in primary care may be seen by specialists in secondary care instead, or they may receive additional expensive diagnostic procedures unavailable in usual care. The success or otherwise of the trial then depends on resources unavailable in usual care, reducing applicability. If these additional resources are essential to the effectiveness of the intervention they should be considered to be part of the intervention and be specified in the part of the protocol describing the intervention.&quot;</span>

2. The organisation of the trial is highly pragmatic. The CDT was delivered as planned in all patients except for two (2.5%) patients, who discontinued CDT prematurely. Follow-up data at 1, 3 and 6 months were not available for 11 (14%), 15 (19%) and 22 (28%) CDT patients, and for 12 (15%), 4 (5%) and 16 (20%) control patients, respectively.

As delivery flexibility is reduced, the trial moves towards a more explanatory approach in this domain. Approaches to delivery flexibility that are likely to reduce the PRECIS-2 score include * A highly specified, protocol driven intervention. For example, specific direction is given for how to the administer the intervention (such as dose, dosing schedule, surgical procedures, educational material, and delivery) * Having measures in place to monitor the compliance of those delivering the intervention (such as doctors) with the protocol and measures (up to and including exclusion) to address poor compliance. * The timing of intervention delivery is tightly defined and designed to maximise the intervention effect. * Providers undertake additional interventions that would not occur in usual care * Restrictions are placed on the number and types of co-interventions, particularly if excluded co-interventions would dilute any intervention effect * There is specific direction for applying permitted co-interventions * There are specific directions for managing complications or side effects of the intervention.' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;As delivery flexibility is reduced, the trial moves towards a more explanatory approach in this domain.

2. The delivery of the intervention in this trial is highly pragmatic. The CDT was delivered as planned in all patients except for two (2.5%) patients, who discontinued CDT prematurely. The patients were free to receive outside of the study any care that was deemed necessary, and most patients did receive at least some psychological, psychotherapeutic, psychiatric or social-psychiatric nursing care; however, the amount of care was low, and there were no differences between control and CDT patients.

3. Score: [5]


1. Flexibility (adherence): What measures are in place to ensure participants adhere to the intervention?

> <span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;It is important that trialists focused on applicability consider how probable it is that there will be uptake of the intervention being tested and how recipients will engage with it in the setting in which it will be later applied. A highly pragmatic design approach would allow for full flexibility in how end user recipients engage with the intervention. In usual care, health professionals encourage patients to take medication or follow therapy as best they can, and such encouragement would not count against a pragmatic design.&quot;</span>

> <span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;As flexibility for recipients is reduced, the trial moves towards a more explanatory approach on this domain. Approaches to recipient flexibility that are likely to reduce the PRECIS-2 score include having a trial pre-screening stage where patients are evaluated for adherence with the intervention and patients judged to not be adherent are excluded, withdrawing patients from the trial if their adherence with the intervention drops below some specified level, and having measures in place to monitor patient adherence with the protocol and measures to address poor adherence.&quot;</span>

2. The flexibility for adherence in this trial is highly pragmatic. The patients were free to receive outside of the study any care that was deemed necessary, and most patients did receive at least some psychological, psychotherapeutic, psychiatric or social-psychiatric nursing care; however, the amount of care was low, and there were no differences between control and CDT patients.

> <span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;This domain encourages trialists to think about follow-up with regard to the setting where the results will be applied. The most pragmatic position with regard to follow-up would be to have no more follow-up of recipients than would be the case in usual care. Indeed, the most extreme position is to have no follow-up contact at all with recipients and to obtain outcome data by other means (such as electronic medical records or other usual data to measure mortality or hospital admissions).&quot;</span>

As follow-up becomes more intense, the trial becomes more explanatory and the PRECIS-2 score will decrease. Follow-up approaches that are likely to reduce the PRECIS-2 score include * Follow-up visits that are more frequent than would typically occur under usual care. * Unscheduled follow-up visits are triggered by a primary outcome event. * Unscheduled follow-up visits are triggered by an intervening event that is likely to lead to the primary outcome event. * Patients are contacted if they fail to keep trial appointments. This would not reduce the PRECIS-2 score if this was also done in usual care. * More extensive data are collected, particularly intervention related data, than would be typical outside the trial' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;As follow-up becomes more intense, the trial becomes more explanatory and the PRECIS-2 score will decrease.

2. The follow-up in this trial is highly pragmatic. The assessments were at baseline and at one, three and six months follow-up via online questionnaires. Data were acquired with use of the open source online application LimeSurvey in compliance with European Union regulations concerning online medical data. For patients the completion of the questionnaires took about 45 minutes and for partners about five minutes per time point.

> <span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The choice of primary outcome is a crucial trial design decision, and a pragmatic approach would be to select an outcome that is of obvious importance from the patient’s perspective. Post-trial, an outcome selected using a pragmatic approach would also be relevant to commissioners of care, the people who decide whether to implement the intervention on the basis of its results.&quot;</span>

> <span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in prompt (Similarity 99.6%):

As the primary outcome becomes less recognisably important to patients, or is assessed on criteria seldom used in usual care, the trial becomes more explanatory and the PRECIS-2 score will decrease.

2. The primary outcome in this trial is highly pragmatic. The primary endpoint was control self-efficacy (Multiple Sclerosis Self-Efficacy Scale Control [MSSES-C] (minimum 90, maximum 900) at six months.

1. Primary analysis: To what extent are all data included?

> <span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Most trials are a superiority design so the most pragmatic approach with regard to the analysis would be to make no special allowance in the analysis for non-adherence, practice variability, etc. In other words, the pragmatic approach to the analysis would typically be an intention-to-treat analysis using all available data. This sort of analysis would score at or close to 5 on PRECIS-2.&quot;</span>

> <span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The intention-to-treat analysis has recently also become the norm for superiority trials taking a more explanatory design approach, especially when regulatory approval for an intervention is being sought. The most explanatory approach would be to use the “as treated analysis” as the primary analysis, in which only those patients who actually received (or did not receive) the intervention would be analysed in the intervention and control groups respectively, irrespective of their initial randomised group allocation.&quot;</span>

> <span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Other causes of missing data may be important but may not affect how pragmatic or explanatory a trial is. Systematic exclusion of data from participants because, say, they were poorly adherent would make a trial more explanatory. Using all data but doing nothing to try and fill gaps caused by missing data would not in itself make trial more pragmatic or explanatory; missing data, especially if there is a lot of it, makes any conclusions more uncertain regardless of the design approach taken.&quot;</span>

2. The primary analysis in this trial is highly pragmatic. The primary outcome was the change in control self-efficacy, assessed by the Multiple Sclerosis Self-Efficacy Scale (MSSES), at six months. The MSSES is a specific and sensitive self-report questionnaire consisting of two 9-items subscales for control and functional self-efficacy, with a high internal consistency and test-retest reliability. Each item is scored from 10 (very uncertain) to 100 (very certain), and addition of the item scores yields the MSSES Control (MSSES-C) and Function (MSSES-F) scores (minimum 90, maximum 900). The MSSES-C measures confidence with managing symptoms and coping with the demands of illness, and the MSSES-F measures confidence with regard to functional abilities.

The full text describes a trial that is highly pragmatic in its design, with a focus on applicability and generalizability. The trial aims to recruit participants from usual care settings, deliver the intervention in a way that is similar to how it would be delivered in usual care, and measure outcomes that are relevant to participants. The trial also aims to follow up participants in a way that is similar to usual care and to include all available data in the analysis. Overall, the trial appears to be highly pragmatic, with a score of 5 for most domains.</pre>

1. Eligibility criteria: Who is selected to participate in the trial?

The eligibility criteria for this trial are relatively pragmatic, as they include people with a definite diagnosis of primary or secondary progressive MS, an EDSS score between 6.5 and 8, and medically stable with adequate cognitive function. However, potential subjects were excluded if they had rapidly progressing disease, were already involved in a physiotherapy programme, had additional neurological conditions or other medical conditions which would preclude them taking part in the study. This exclusion of people with rapidly progressing disease and additional medical conditions may reduce the generalizability of the trial results to the broader population of people with MS. Score: [4]

2. Recruitment: How are participants recruited into the trial?

The recruitment of participants in this trial is relatively pragmatic, as they were recruited from the MS Service, NHS Ayrshire and Arran, and had a definite diagnosis of primary or secondary progressive MS, and an EDSS score between 6.5 and 8. However, potential subjects were excluded if they had rapidly progressing disease, were already involved in a physiotherapy programme, had additional neurological conditions or other medical conditions which would preclude them taking part in the study. This exclusion of people with rapidly progressing disease and additional medical conditions may reduce the generalizability of the trial results to the broader population of people with MS. Score: [4]

3. Setting: Where is the trial being done?

The setting of this trial is relatively pragmatic, as the assessments were undertaken at the Douglas Grant Rehabilitation Centre, Irvine, and the assessor remained blind to the subjects’ treatment group allocation. However, the trial was conducted at a single center, which may limit the generalizability of the trial results to other settings. Score: [3]

4. Organization: What expertise and resources are needed to deliver the intervention?

The organization of this trial is relatively pragmatic, as the intervention was delivered by an experienced domiciliary physiotherapist within the subjects’ homes. The intervention included upper and lower limb strengthening using thera-band, mobile pedals, and weights, and repetition of tasks such as sit to stand, gait, balance, and stretching activities. However, the trial did not specify the expertise and resources needed to deliver the intervention, which may limit the reproducibility of the trial results. Score: [3]

5. Flexibility (delivery): How should the intervention be delivered?

The flexibility of the intervention delivery in this trial is relatively pragmatic, as the intervention was delivered by an experienced domiciliary physiotherapist within the subjects’ homes, and included upper and lower limb strengthening using thera-band, mobile pedals, and weights, and repetition of tasks such as sit to stand, gait, balance, and stretching activities. However, the trial did not specify the flexibility of the intervention delivery, which may limit the generalizability of the trial results to other settings. Score: [3]

6. Flexibility (adherence): What measures are in place to ensure participants adhere to the intervention?

The flexibility of the participants’ adherence to the intervention in this trial is relatively pragmatic, as subjects were asked not to discuss their group allocation with the assessor. However, the trial did not specify other measures to ensure participants adhere to the intervention, which may limit the reproducibility of the trial results. Score: [3]

7. Follow-up: How closely are participants followed up?

The follow-up of participants in this trial is relatively pragmatic, as subjects were assessed at the beginning and at the end of the eight-week intervention period (i.e. either physiotherapy or control) and then again eight weeks later. However, the trial did not specify the intensity of measurement and follow-up of participants in the trial and the likely follow-up in usual care, which may limit the generalizability of the trial results to other settings. Score: [3]

8. Primary outcome: How relevant is it to participants?

The primary outcome of this trial is relatively pragmatic, as the MS impact scale (MSIS 29), which is a measure of the physical and psychological impact of MS, was the primary outcome measure for the study. However, the trial did not specify the relevance of the primary outcome to participants, which may limit the generalizability of the trial results to other settings. Score: [3]

9. Primary analysis: To what extent are all data included?

The primary analysis of this trial is relatively pragmatic, as all assessments were undertaken at the Douglas Grant Rehabilitation Centre, Irvine, and the assessor remained blind to the subjects’ treatment group allocation. Subjects were asked not to discuss their group allocation with the assessor. However, the trial did not specify the extent to which all data were included in the analysis of the primary outcome, which may limit the reproducibility of the trial results. Score: [3]</pre>

> <span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;A highly pragmatic approach to eligibility criteria would be to include in the trial anyone with the condition of interest who is likely to be a candidate for the intervention if it was being provided in usual care for this condition.&quot;</span>

2. The trial in the full text is a randomized controlled trial of home-based care versus hospital care for multiple sclerosis patients. The eligibility criteria for the trial are not explicitly stated in the full text, but it can be inferred that the trial included patients with clinically definite multiple sclerosis who lived in the Rome service area. The trial excluded patients who were not willing to participate or who were referred to the multiple sclerosis centers only for a second opinion but were regularly followed by their own neurologists.

3. Score: [3] - The trial is more pragmatic than explanatory in the eligibility criteria domain, as it included patients who were likely to receive the intervention in usual care. However, the trial did exclude patients who were not willing to participate or who were referred to the multiple sclerosis centers only for a second opinion, which may reduce the pragmatism of the trial.

1. Recruitment: How are participants recruited into the trial?

> <span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The most extreme pragmatic approach to recruitment would be to do this in usual care so that only the people who attend a clinic with the condition of interest are recruited after they present on their own behalf without any overt recruitment effort.&quot;</span>

> <span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Recruiting through usual appointments at a diverse range of clinics is likely to score at or close to 5 on the PRECIS-2 scale.&quot;</span>

> <span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Additional recruitment approaches that could potentially reduce the PRECIS-2 score include media advertising campaigns such as television and radio advertisements, newspaper advertisements, flyers, websites, press releases, letters to the editor, interviews with the chief investigator on television or radio.&quot;</span>

4. The trial in the full text recruited patients from the multiple sclerosis center of the neurological department of La Sapienza University or from other institutional centers for multiple sclerosis in Rome. The trial did not specify the recruitment methods used, but it can be inferred that the trial did not use media advertising campaigns or other non-usual care recruitment methods.

5. Score: [4] - The trial is more pragmatic than explanatory in the recruitment domain, as it recruited patients from usual care settings. However, the trial did not explicitly state the recruitment methods used, so it is unclear whether the trial used any non-usual care recruitment methods that may reduce the pragmatism of the trial.

6. The trial in the full text was conducted in Rome and recruited patients from the multiple sclerosis center of the neurological department of La Sapienza University or from other institutional centers for multiple sclerosis in Rome. The trial did not specify whether the participating centers were specialist or academic centers, but it can be inferred that the trial was conducted in multiple centers.

7. Score: [4] - The trial is more pragmatic than explanatory in the setting domain, as it was conducted in multiple centers that may be similar to the usual care settings where the trial results are intended to be applied. However, the trial did not explicitly state whether the participating centers were specialist or academic centers, so it is unclear whether the trial used any setting characteristics that may reduce the pragmatism of the trial.

16. The trial in the full text reported the following primary outcomes: functional status, as measured by validated measures of physical and psychological impairment and quality of life (SF-36 health survey), and costs to the National Health Service over the one-year follow-up period.

17. Score: [4] - The trial is more pragmatic than explanatory in the primary outcome domain, as it reported functional status and costs, which may be relevant to patients and commissioners of care. However, the trial did not explicitly state the rationale for choosing these primary outcomes, so it is unclear whether the trial used any primary outcome characteristics that may reduce the pragmatism of the trial.

1. Eligibility criteria: Who is selected to participate in the trial?

> <span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;A highly pragmatic approach to eligibility criteria would be to include in the trial anyone with the condition of interest who is likely to be a candidate for the intervention if it was being provided in usual care for this condition. So, if in usual care the intervention would likely be used for children, elderly people, people with a range of comorbidities, and people with a probable diagnosis rather than, say, a laboratory confirmed diagnosis, then all of these groups should be in the trial too.&quot;</span>

> <span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Many things could reduce the score, but some examples include excluding people not known or shown to be highly adherent to the intervention, excluding people using tests or measures that are not used or available in usual care, excluding people not expected to be highly responsive to the intervention, excluding people who would be likely to receive the intervention in usual care but inclusion in the trial is considered too difficult because of challenges unrelated to the delivery of the intervention. Children, people over the age of 65, and pregnant women are good examples of people commonly excluded because of anticipated difficulties of gaining ethical approval rather than whether they would be likely to receive an intervention in usual care.&quot;</span>

2. Reasoning:

The trial included participants with a probable diagnosis of Multiple Sclerosis (MS) and foot drop, which is a pragmatic approach as it reflects the usual care setting where the intervention would be applied. However, the trial excluded people with severe cognitive impairment, foot drop due to other disorders, conditions significantly affecting gait, contraindications to functional electrical stimulation, marked proximal weakness, plantar flexor spasticity, stance phase instability, or severe lower limb/trunk ataxia affecting gait. These exclusion criteria reduce the pragmatic nature of the trial, as they limit the generalizability of the results to a more specific population.

3. Score: [3]


2. Recruitment: How are participants recruited into the trial?

> <span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The most extreme pragmatic approach to recruitment would be to do this in usual care so that only the people who attend a clinic with the condition of interest are recruited after they present on their own behalf without any overt recruitment effort. A highly pragmatic approach to trial design would also recruit from more than one clinic as an explicit way of increasing applicability of the trial results.&quot;</span>

> <span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Additional recruitment approaches that could potentially reduce the PRECIS-2 score include media advertising campaigns such as television and radio advertisements, newspaper advertisements, flyers, websites, press releases, letters to the editor, interviews with the chief investigator on television or radio. The issue to consider here is whether these campaigns are being used simply to speed up recruitment, or because they are the only way to reach a dispersed population. In the latter case, if such campaigns would not be available in usual care then this trial recruitment route is more explanatory.&quot;</span>

4. Reasoning:

The trial recruited participants from seven Multiple Sclerosis outpatient centers across Scotland, which is a pragmatic approach as it reflects the usual care setting where the intervention would be applied. However, the trial did not specify whether participants were recruited during their usual appointments or if extra recruitment strategies were used. The text mentions that potential participants were informed of the study and issued with a participant information sheet, but it does not provide details about the recruitment process.

5. Score: [3]


3. Setting: Where is the trial being done?

> <span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The most extremely pragmatic approach to setting would be to do the trial in an identical setting to which you intend the results to be applied. Such a trial is likely to score at or close to 5 on PRECIS-2.&quot;</span>

> <span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Approaches to setting that are likely to reduce the PRECIS-2 score include selecting participating centres from among only specialist or academic centres when the trial is intended to be applicable to all types of practice or clinic treating the condition of interest. Running the trial in a single centre. It is rare that a trial is done with the intention that its results should apply to only that single centre.&quot;</span>

6. Reasoning:

The trial was conducted in seven Multiple Sclerosis outpatient centers across Scotland, which is a pragmatic approach as it reflects the usual care setting where the intervention would be applied. However, the text does not provide information about the similarity of these centers to the usual care setting or whether they were selected based on their expertise or specialization.

7. Score: [4]


4. Organisation: What expertise and resources are needed to deliver the intervention?

> <span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;A highly pragmatic design would aim to slot the intervention into the usual organisation of care for the condition of interest, making use of no more than the existing healthcare staff and resources in that setting. A design like this is likely to score at or close to 5 on PRECIS-2.&quot;</span>

> <span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The PRECIS-2 organisation score will be reduced to the degree trialists make changes in how care is delivered compared with the usual recipients and care delivery. For example, the trial team may, in the intervention arm, provide additional training to staff or provide additional staff so that the intervention can be delivered. Patients who would normally be seen in primary care may be seen by specialists in secondary care instead, or they may receive additional expensive diagnostic procedures unavailable in usual care. The success or otherwise of the trial then depends on resources unavailable in usual care, reducing applicability. If these additional resources are essential to the effectiveness of the intervention they should be considered to be part of the intervention and be specified in the part of the protocol describing the intervention.&quot;</span>

8. Reasoning:

The trial provided additional training to staff to deliver the intervention, which reduces the pragmatic nature of the trial. However, the trial did not specify whether patients were seen by specialists in secondary care or received additional diagnostic procedures unavailable in usual care.

9. Score: [3]


5. Flexibility (delivery): How should the intervention be delivered?

> <span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;In PRECIS-2, trialists wishing to conduct more pragmatic trials are encouraged to think about how the intervention will be implemented post-trial in the setting where the results are expected to be applied. The most pragmatic design approach to delivery flexibility would leave the details of how to implement the intervention up to providers, in other words, what happens in usual care. For example, the details of how to perform a surgical procedure could be left entirely to the surgeon, or how to deliver an educational programme is left to the discretion of the educator. Additionally, a pragmatic approach would not dictate which other interventions were permitted, or how to deliver them, which again is the situation in usual practice.&quot;</span>

> <span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;As delivery flexibility is reduced, the trial moves towards a more explanatory approach in this domain. Approaches to delivery flexibility that are likely to reduce the PRECIS-2 score include a highly specified, protocol driven intervention. For example, specific direction is given for how to the administer the intervention (such as dose, dosing schedule, surgical procedures, educational material, and delivery)&quot;</span>

10. Reasoning:

The trial did not specify the details of how the intervention was delivered, which is a pragmatic approach as it reflects the usual care setting where the intervention would be applied. However, the trial did not mention whether the intervention was left up to providers or whether it was highly specified in the protocol.

11. Score: [4]


6. Flexibility (adherence): What measures are in place to ensure participants adhere to the intervention?

> <span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;It is important that trialists focused on applicability consider how probable it is that there will be uptake of the intervention being tested and how recipients will engage with it in the setting in which it will be later applied. A highly pragmatic design approach would allow for full flexibility in how end user recipients engage with the intervention. In usual care, health professionals encourage patients to take medication or follow therapy as best they can, and such encouragement would not count against a pragmatic design; if it also happens in usual care, allowing it in the trial is a pragmatic design decision.&quot;</span>

> <span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;As flexibility for recipients is reduced, the trial moves towards a more explanatory approach on this domain. Approaches to recipient flexibility that are likely to reduce the PRECIS-2 score include having a trial pre-screening stage where patients are evaluated for adherence with the intervention (such as dose, dosing schedule, attendance at therapy sessions). Patients judged to not be adherent are excluded.&quot;</span>

12. Reasoning:

The trial did not specify any measures to ensure participant adherence to the intervention, which is a pragmatic approach as it reflects the usual care setting where the intervention would be applied. However, the trial did not mention whether there was a trial pre-screening stage where patients were evaluated for adherence with the intervention.

13. Score: [5]


7. Follow-up: How closely are participants followed up?

> <span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;This domain encourages trialists to think about follow-up with regard to the setting where the results will be applied. The most pragmatic position with regard to follow-up would be to have no more follow-up of recipients than would be the case in usual care. Indeed, the most extreme position is to have no follow-up contact at all with recipients and to obtain outcome data by other means (such as electronic medical records or other usual data to measure mortality or hospital admissions). Trials that have no more follow-up than is normal in usual care and have minimal additional data collection (or use data obtained from administrative or clinical record systems without direct contact with the participant) would be likely to score at or close to 5 on PRECIS-2.&quot;</span>

> <span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;It is often the case that explanatory trials are interested in the effect of an intervention only during a brief intervention period or shortly after. On the other hand, trials taking a pragmatic approach to design may follow recipients well beyond the intervention period. This longer period of follow-up may require more contacts than would be the case in usual care, but this need not be inconsistent with a pragmatic approach if it does not result in care management that differs from the usual conditions. It is, however, important to consider the burden of follow-up for participants.&quot;</span>

14. Reasoning:

The trial had minimal additional data collection and used data obtained from administrative or clinical record systems without direct contact with the participant, which is a pragmatic approach as it reflects the usual care setting where the intervention would be applied. However, the trial did not mention whether there was a longer period of follow-up beyond the intervention period.

15. Score: [4]


8. Primary outcome: How relevant is it to participants?

> <span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The choice of primary outcome is a crucial trial design decision, and a pragmatic approach would be to select an outcome that is of obvious importance from the patient’s perspective. Post-trial, an outcome selected using a pragmatic approach would also be relevant to commissioners of care, the people who decide whether to implement the intervention on the basis of its results. For example, an intervention that aims to reduce falls in elderly people living independently in the community should have as its primary outcome the number of falls in the elderly living independently in the community. This outcome has meaning to patients, their relatives and friends, healthcare professionals, and policymakers. Measures of, say, bone density, muscle strength, or functional ability are distant from the key question of whether the intervention prevents elderly people falling in their own homes. Trials that choose outcomes of obvious importance to patients, and measure them in a way that is the same or similar to the way they are measured in usual care would be likely to score at or close to 5 on PRECIS-2.&quot;</span>

> <span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;As the primary outcome becomes less recognisably important to patients, or is assessed on criteria seldom used in usual care, the trial becomes more explanatory and the PRECIS-2 score will decrease. Approaches to the primary outcomes that are likely to reduce the PRECIS-2 score include choosing a surrogate outcome (such as blood test) that the intervention is expected to have a direct effect on, or the use of safety climate surveys rather than medical error events or near miss events.&quot;</span>

16. Reasoning:

The trial chose the 5-minute self-selected walk test as the primary outcome, which is a pragmatic approach as it reflects the usual care setting where the intervention would be applied. However, the trial did not mention whether the primary outcome was of obvious importance to patients or measured in a way that is the same or similar to the way it is measured in usual care.

17. Score: [3]

This sort of analysis would score at or close to 5 on PRECIS-2. (Non-inferiority and equivalence trials are usually contrary to intention-to-treat analysis.)&quot;</span>

> <span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Approaches to the primary analysis that are likely to reduce the PRECIS-2 score include excluding non-compliant recipients (per protocol analysis), analyse recipients to treatment received instead of treatment randomised (as treated analysis), excluding data from non-adherent providers, excluding data from trial sites or providers who recruit below expected volume.&quot;</span>

18. Reasoning:

The trial used an intention-to-treat analysis, which is a pragmatic approach as it reflects the usual care setting where the intervention would be applied. However, the trial did not mention whether non-compliant recipients were excluded or whether data from non-adherent providers or trial sites were excluded.

1. Eligibility criteria: Who is selected to participate in the trial?

> <span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;A highly pragmatic approach to eligibility criteria would be to include in the trial anyone with the condition of interest who is likely to be a candidate for the intervention if it was being provided in usual care for this condition.&quot;</span>

> <span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;If people aged over 80 or with multiple morbidities would not receive the intervention in usual care because we already know that this intervention does more harm than good in elderly or multi-morbid patients, then a pragmatic design choice would be to exclude them from the trial.&quot;</span>

> <span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Excluding people not known or shown to be highly adherent to the intervention.&quot;</span>

2. The trial in question is a randomized controlled trial (RCT) comparing a group-based cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) intervention for managing fatigue in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients to current local practice. The inclusion criteria are: (1) clinically definite MS diagnosis, (2) fatigue impacting on daily life (Fatigue Severity Scale total score >4), and (3) ambulatory. The exclusion criteria are: (1) having taken part in a fatigue programme in the last year, (2) cognitive impairments, (3) a relapse in the pre-previous 3 months, or (4) having started treatment with disease modifying or antidepressant drugs within the previous 3 months.

3. The trial appears to have a relatively pragmatic approach to eligibility criteria, as it includes anyone with a clinically definite MS diagnosis and fatigue impacting on daily life, regardless of age or comorbidities. However, the exclusion of those who have taken part in a fatigue programme in the last year or those who have received a fatigue intervention from a health professional in the past 3 months may limit the generalizability of the results to some extent. Overall, the trial seems to strike a reasonable balance between internal and external validity, and I would score the eligibility criteria domain as: <span style='background-color: #ff9e81' title='Added score prefix during extraction'>Score: [4]</span>


1. Recruitment: How are participants recruited into the trial?

> <span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The most extreme pragmatic approach to recruitment would be to do this in usual care so that only the people who attend a clinic with the condition of interest are recruited after they present on their own behalf without any overt recruitment effort.&quot;</span>

> <span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Recruiting through usual appointments at a diverse range of clinics is likely to score at or close to 5 on the PRECIS-2 scale.&quot;</span>

> <span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Additional recruitment approaches that could potentially reduce the PRECIS-2 score include media advertising campaigns such as television and radio advertisements, newspaper advertisements, flyers, websites, press releases, letters to the editor, interviews with the chief investigator on television or radio.&quot;</span>

2. The trial recruited participants from primary or secondary care, or via MS Society newsletters/websites. No information is provided about the use of media advertising campaigns or other non-standard recruitment methods.

3. The recruitment approach in this trial appears to be relatively pragmatic, as it involves recruiting participants from primary and secondary care, as well as through MS Society newsletters and websites. However, the lack of information about the use of other recruitment methods makes it difficult to assess the extent to which the trial deviates from usual care. Overall, I would score the recruitment domain as: <span style='background-color: #ff9e81' title='Added score prefix during extraction'>Score: [4]</span>


1. Setting: Where is the trial being done?

> <span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The most extremely pragmatic approach to setting would be to do the trial in an identical setting to which you intend the results to be applied.&quot;</span>

> <span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Approaches to setting that are likely to reduce the PRECIS-2 score include selecting participating centres from among only specialist or academic centres when the trial is intended to be applicable to all types of practice or clinic treating the condition of interest.&quot;</span>

2. The trial was conducted in three UK centres (Poole, Bristol, Southampton/Portsmouth). No information is provided about the type of centres (e.g., academic, specialty, community).

3. The setting domain is difficult to assess without more information about the type of centres involved in the trial. If the centres are typical of those where the intervention would be implemented in usual care, then the setting domain would score highly on the PRECIS-2 scale. However, if the centres are specialty or academic centres, then the setting domain may be less pragmatic. Overall, I would score the setting domain as: <span style='background-color: #ff9e81' title='Added score prefix during extraction'>Score: [NA]</span>


1. Organisation: What expertise and resources are needed to deliver the intervention?

> <span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;A highly pragmatic design would aim to slot the intervention into the usual organisation of care for the condition of interest, making use of no more than the existing healthcare staff and resources in that setting.&quot;</span>

> <span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Organisational approaches that are likely to reduce the PRECIS-2 score include increasing the number of healthcare or other professionals available to deliver the intervention over and above the levels available in usual care.&quot;</span>

2. The trial involved two health professionals with experience of working with people with MS and group-work (such as occupational therapists, nurses, or physiotherapists) delivering the intervention in hotel meeting-room facilities or a rehabilitation hospital. Facilitators were qualified to a senior/advanced level and received training and psychological advice and debriefing throughout the trial.

3. The organisation domain appears to be relatively pragmatic, as the intervention is delivered by health professionals who are routinely involved in managing MS and supported by a clinical psychologist. The use of existing healthcare staff and resources in the setting is consistent with a pragmatic approach. However, the fact that facilitators were trained to deliver the intervention at 1-day workshops and received psychological advice and debriefing throughout the trial may reduce the pragmatism of the organisation domain somewhat. Overall, I would score the organisation domain as: <span style='background-color: #ff9e81' title='Added score prefix during extraction'>Score: [4]</span>


1. Flexibility (delivery): How should the intervention be delivered?

> <span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;In PRECIS-2, trialists wishing to conduct more pragmatic trials are encouraged to think about how the intervention will be implemented post-trial in the setting where the results are expected to be applied.&quot;</span>

> <span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;As delivery flexibility is reduced, the trial moves towards a more explanatory approach in this domain.&quot;</span>

2. The trial does not provide detailed information about the flexibility of the intervention delivery. However, the fact that the intervention is delivered in group-based sessions by health professionals with experience of working with people with MS and group-work suggests that there may be some flexibility in how the intervention is delivered.

3. The flexibility of the intervention delivery domain is difficult to assess without more information about the specifics of how the intervention was delivered in the trial. However, the fact that the intervention is delivered in group-based sessions by health professionals with experience of working with people with MS and group-work suggests that there may be some flexibility in how the intervention is delivered, which is consistent with a pragmatic approach. Overall, I would score the flexibility (delivery) domain as: <span style='background-color: #ff9e81' title='Added score prefix during extraction'>Score: [NA]</span>


1. Flexibility (adherence): What measures are in place to ensure participants adhere to the intervention?

1. Follow-up: How closely are participants followed up?

2. The trial collected outcome measures 1 week before the start of the intervention, 1 month after the final session, and 4 months after the final session. Participants assigned to the control arm completed all outcome measures within an identical time frame to those in the intervention arm.

3. The follow-up domain appears to be relatively pragmatic, as the trial collects outcome measures at three time points that are similar to what might occur in usual care. However, the fact that the trial collects outcome measures at specific time points rather than allowing for more flexibility in when they are collected may reduce the pragmatism of the follow-up domain somewhat. Overall, I would score the follow-up domain as: <span style='background-color: #ff9e81' title='Added score prefix during extraction'>Score: [4]</span>

Approaches to the primary outcomes that are likely to reduce the PRECIS-2 score include * Choosing a surrogate outcome (such as blood test) that the intervention is expected to have a direct effect on, or the use of safety climate surveys rather than medical error events or near miss events. * Using a composite primary outcome in which some of the elements are less important to patients or participants than others (such as incidence of death, stroke, myocardial infarction, or renal dysfunction at 30 days). * Having central adjudication of the outcome or using an assessment that needs special training or tests not normally used in usual care. * Choosing an outcome that is important but mainly to providers, typically because it is a physiological outcome considered useful in treatment planning and monitoring.' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;Approaches to the primary outcomes that are likely to reduce the PRECIS-2 score include choosing a surrogate outcome, having central adjudication of the outcome or using an assessment that needs special training or tests not used in usual care, and choosing an outcome that is important but mainly to providers, typically because it is a physiological outcome considered useful in treatment planning and monitoring.&quot;</span>

2. The primary outcomes of the trial are fatigue severity (Global Fatigue Severity subscale of the Fatigue Assessment Instrument), self-efficacy for managing fatigue (Multiple Sclerosis-Fatigue Self-Efficacy scale), and disease-specific quality of life (Multiple Sclerosis Impact Scale).

3. The primary outcome domain appears to be relatively pragmatic, as the trial selects outcomes that are of obvious importance from the patient's perspective.

Excluding people using tests or measures that are not used or available in usual care. Excluding people not expected to be highly responsive to the intervention. Excluding people who would be likely to receive the intervention in usual care but inclusion in the trial is considered too difficult because of challenges unrelated to the delivery of the intervention.&quot;</span> [Loudon 2015 shortened.txt]

2. The full text describes the eligibility criteria for the trial, which includes people with MS who are able to walk 10 meters with or without an aid within 2 minutes, have no relapse of their MS in the past 4 weeks, and no other neurological or orthopedic condition that would affect their function. Participants were excluded if they were already engaged in a formal exercise program lasting >30 minutes twice per week, experienced an exacerbation within the past 4 weeks, had their MS immunomodulation medications altered in the previous 4 weeks or during the trial period, or declined to be randomly allocated. These criteria are similar to those used in usual care, making the trial more pragmatic. However, the trial excluded people who were too active, which is not a common exclusion criterion in usual care. This reduces the pragmatism of the trial.

   Score: [4]

3. Recruitment:

4. The full text describes the recruitment process, which involved recruiting community dwelling people with MS through the Multiple Sclerosis Society of New South Wales and South Australia. Participants were required to have a diagnosis of MS made by a neurologist, be able to walk 10 meters with or without an aid within 2 minutes, have no relapse of their MS in the past 4 weeks, and no other neurological or orthopedic condition that would affect their function. These criteria are similar to those used in usual care, making the trial more pragmatic. However, the trial excluded people who were already engaged in a formal exercise program lasting >30 minutes twice per week, experienced an exacerbation within the past 4 weeks, had their MS immunomodulation medications altered in the previous 4 weeks or during the trial period, or declined to be randomly allocated. These criteria are more restrictive than those used in usual care, reducing the pragmatism of the trial.

   <span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The PRECIS-2 organisation score will be reduced to the degree trialists make changes in how care is delivered compared with the usual recipients and care delivery. For example, the trial team may, in the intervention arm, provide additional training to staff or provide additional staff so that the intervention can be delivered. Patients who would normally be seen in primary care may be seen by specialists in secondary care instead, or they may receive additional expensive diagnostic procedures unavailable in usual care.&quot;</span> [Loudon 2015 shortened.txt]

8. The full text describes the organization of the trial, which included two, 60-minute sessions per week, held at least 2 days apart for 8 weeks. Exercises were aimed at improving gait speed, endurance, and balance, and were individualized, specific, progressed in load, and performed at a moderate to high intensity. Guidelines were provided to physiotherapists and participants for exercises to be adapted and progressed to suit individual functional ability. In both group and home exercise sessions, participants completed eight, 6 minute exercises/stations per session plus a 5-minute warm up and cool down. Participants were encouraged to maintain their usual activity levels and engagement in any other exercise throughout the trial, with any varia

tion self-reported to the treating physiotherapist. This is similar to the organization of care in usual practice, making the trial more pragmatic. However, the trial provided an illustrated training booklet and an activity diary to home exercise participants, which is not a common feature of usual care, reducing the pragmatism of the trial.

9. Flexibility (delivery):

   <span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;In PRECIS-2, trialists wishing to conduct more pragmatic trials are encouraged to think about how the intervention will be implemented post-trial in the setting where the results are expected to be applied. The most pragmatic design approach to delivery flexibility would leave the details of how to implement the intervention up to providers, in other words, what happens in usual care.&quot;</span> [Loudon 2015 shortened.txt]

Approaches to delivery flexibility that are likely to reduce the PRECIS-2 score include A highly specified, protocol driven intervention. Having measures in place to monitor the compliance of those delivering the intervention (such as doctors) with the protocol and measures (up to and including exclusion) to address poor compliance.&quot;</span> [Loudon 2015 shortened.txt]

10. The full text describes the flexibility of the intervention delivery, which was individualized, specific, progressed in load, and performed at a moderate to high intensity. Participants were encouraged to work at a pace at which they could exercise for the full 6 minutes, but could rest if they felt fatigue, or had a perceived exertion of greater than 7/10 on the modified Borg scale. This is similar to the flexibility of intervention delivery in usual care, making the trial more pragmatic. However, the trial had specific directions for applying permitted co-interventions and complications, reducing the pragmatism of the trial.

11. Flexibility (adherence):

    <span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;It is important that trialists focused on applicability consider how probable it is that there will be uptake of the intervention being tested and how recipients will engage with it in the setting in which it will be later applied. A highly pragmatic design approach would allow for full flexibility in how end user recipients engage with the intervention. In usual care, health professionals encourage patients to take medication or follow therapy as best they can, and such encouragement would not count against a pragmatic design; if it also happens in usual care, allowing it in the trial is a pragmatic design decision.&quot;</span> [Loudon 2015 shortened.txt]

    <span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;As flexibility for recipients is reduced, the trial moves towards a more explanatory approach on this domain. Approaches to recipient flexibility that are likely to reduce the PRECIS-2 score include Having a trial pre-screening stage where patients are evaluated for adherence with the intervention (such as dose, dosing schedule, attendance at therapy sessions). Withdrawing patients from the trial if their adherence with the intervention drops below some specified level. Having measures in place to monitor patient adherence with the protocol and measures (up to and including withdrawal) to address poor adherence.&quot;</span> [Loudon 2015 shortened.txt]

12. The full text describes the flexibility of recipient adherence, which allowed for full flexibility in how end user recipients engaged with the intervention. Participants were encouraged to maintain their usual activity levels and engagement in any other exercise throughout the trial, with any variation self-reported to the treating physiotherapist.

13. Follow-up:

    <span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;This domain encourages trialists to think about follow-up with regard to the setting where the results will be applied. The most pragmatic position with regard to follow-up would be to have no more follow-up of recipients than would be the case in usual care. Indeed, the most extreme position is to have no follow-up contact at all with recipients and to obtain outcome data by other means (such as electronic medical records or other usual data to measure mortality or hospital admissions). Trials that have no more follow-up than is normal in usual care and have minimal additional data collection (or use data obtained from administrative or clinical record systems without direct contact with the participant) would be likely to score at or close to 5 on PRECIS-2.&quot;</span> [Loudon 2015 shortened.txt]

    <span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;As follow-up becomes more intense, the trial becomes more explanatory and the PRECIS-2 score will decrease. Follow-up approaches that are likely to reduce the PRECIS-2 score include Follow-up visits that are more frequent than would typically occur under usual care. Unscheduled follow-up visits are triggered by a primary outcome event. Unscheduled follow-up visits are triggered by an intervening event that is likely to lead to the primary outcome event. Patients are contacted if they fail to keep trial appointments. This would not reduce the PRECIS-2 score if this was also done in usual care.&quot;</span> [Loudon 2015 shortened.txt]

14. The full text describes the follow-up of the trial, which included outcome assessments conducted at baseline, immediately post-intervention, and at 8-week follow-up. Participants were assessed at two points at baseline to establish stability of presentation, and assessments were conducted by physiotherapists blinded to group allocation and trained in administering the outcome measures. This is similar to the follow-up in usual care, making the trial more pragmatic. However, the trial had more frequent follow-up visits than would typically occur under usual care, reducing the pragmatism of the trial.

15. Primary outcome:

    <span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The choice of primary outcome is a crucial trial design decision, and a pragmatic approach would be to select an outcome that is of obvious importance from the patient’s perspective. Post-trial, an outcome selected using a pragmatic approach would also be relevant to commissioners of care, the people who decide whether to implement the intervention on the basis of its results. For example, an intervention that aims to reduce falls in elderly people living independently in the community should have as its primary outcome the number of falls in the elderly living independently in the community. This outcome has meaning to patients, their relatives and friends, healthcare professionals, and policymakers. Measures of, say, bone density, muscle strength, or functional ability are distant from the key question of whether the intervention prevents elderly people falling in their own homes. Trials that choose outcomes of obvious importance to patients, and measure them in a way that is the same or similar to the way they are measured in usual care would be likely to score at or close to 5 on PRECIS-2.&quot;</span> [Loudon 2015 shortened.txt]

    <span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;As the primary outcome becomes less recognisably important to patients, or is assessed on criteria seldom used in usual care, the trial becomes more explanatory and the PRECIS-2 score will decrease. Approaches to the primary outcomes that are likely to reduce the PRECIS-2 score include Choosing a surrogate outcome (such as blood test) that the intervention is expected to have a direct effect on, or the use of safety climate surveys rather than medical error events or near miss events. Having central adjudication of the outcome or using an assessment that needs special training or tests not normally used in usual care. Choosing an outcome that is important but mainly to providers, typically because it is a physiological outcome considered useful in treatment planning and monitoring.&quot;</span> [Loudon 2015 shortened.txt]

16. The full text describes the primary outcome of the trial, which was gait speed, measured using the 10-meter walk test. Participants were asked to walk over a 14-meter uncluttered indoor path at their fastest but safe pace wearing their usual footwear. Walking aids were allowed but no physical assistance from another person was permitted. Speed for the middle 10 meters was recorded using a stopwatch. This test has established normative values and demonstrated high inter- and intra-tester reliability in people with MS. This is an outcome that is of obvious importance to patients and is measured in a way that is the same as in usual care, making the trial more pragmatic.

17. Primary analysis:

    <span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Most trials are a superiority design so the most pragmatic approach with regard to the analysis would be to make no special allowance in the analysis for non-adherence, practice variability, etc. In other words, the pragmatic approach to the analysis would typically be an intention-to-treat analysis using all available data. This sort of analysis would score at or close to 5 on PRECIS-2. (Non-inferiority and equivalence trials are usually contrary to intention-to-treat analysis.)&quot;</span> [Loudon 2015 shortened.txt]

The text also mentions that trials that choose outcomes of obvious importance to patients, and measure them in a way that is the same or similar to the way they are measured in usual care would be likely to score at or close to 5 on PRECIS-2. The text also mentions that approaches to the primary outcomes that are likely to reduce the pragmatic nature of the trial include choosing a surrogate outcome (such as blood test) that the intervention is expected to have a direct effect on.

Score: [5]

1. Eligibility criteria: Who is selected to participate in the trial?

> <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants randomized to the ‘polypill-based strategy’ received a polypill containing aspirin 75 mg, simvastatin 40 mg, lisinopril 10 mg and either atenolol 50 mg or hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg. Participants randomized to ‘usual care’ continued with separate medications and doses as prescribed by their doctor.&quot;</span>

> <span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 99.8%):

Each participant had to have, in their doctor’s view, indications for all and no contraindications to any component of at least one of two polypills – version 1 (containing aspirin 75 mg, simvastatin 40 mg, lisinopril 10 mg, atenolol 50 mg) or version 2 (containing aspirin 75 mg, simvastatin 40 mg, lisinopril 10 mg, hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg). Participants were excluded if it was felt clinically inappropriate to alter medications.' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;Each participant had to have, in their doctor’s view, indications for all and no contra-indications to any component of at least one of two polypills – version 1 (containing aspirin 75 mg, simvastatin 40 mg, lisinopril 10 mg, atenolol 50 mg) or version 2 (containing aspirin 75 mg, simvastatin 40 mg, lisinopril 10 mg, hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg). Participants were excluded if it was felt clinically inappropriate to alter medications.&quot;</span>

> <span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in prompt (Similarity 96.6%):

pragmatic approach to eligibility criteria would be to include in the trial anyone with the condition of interest who is likely to be a candidate for the intervention if it was being provided in usual care for this condition.' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;The most pragmatic approach to eligibility criteria would be to include in the trial anyone with the condition of interest who is likely to be a candidate for the intervention if it was being provided in usual care for this condition.&quot;</span>

2. The trial selected participants based on their doctor's view of their indications and contraindications for the polypill components. This approach is more pragmatic than selecting participants based on strict laboratory or imaging criteria, as it aligns with the usual care approach of relying on clinical judgment. However, the trial still excluded participants if it was felt clinically inappropriate to alter medications, which may reduce the pragmatic score.

Score: [4]

2. Recruitment: How are participants recruited into the trial?

> <span title='Moderate quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 87.6%):

> <span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in prompt (Similarity 99.2%):

3. Participants were recruited from general practices and had established CVD or an estimated five-year CVD risk of 15%. This approach is more pragmatic than recruiting from specialized centers or using strict inclusion criteria. However, the trial did not explicitly state whether recruitment was done in usual care or through additional strategies, which may reduce the pragmatic score.

Score: [3]

3. Setting: Where is the trial being done?

> <span title='Major quote deviation, possible hallucination. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 55.4%):

in Australian general practice' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: red'>&quot;The trial was conducted in Australian general practices.&quot;</span>

> <span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The most extremely pragmatic approach to setting would be to do the trial in an identical setting to which you intend the results to be applied.&quot;</span>

4. The trial was conducted in Australian general practices, which aligns with the usual care setting for the target population. This approach is more pragmatic than conducting the trial in specialized centers or in a different healthcare system.

Score: [5]

4. Organization: What expertise and resources are needed to deliver the intervention?

> <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;All participants were treated by their regular doctor following randomization. No attempt was made to influence the management of usual care participants. Those allocated to the polypill-based strategy were prescribed one of the polypills at the discretion of their doctor, to be taken at a time suggested by the doctor. No attempt was made to influence any other aspect of their management. The doctor could, at any time, change prescription to the alternative polypill version, add drugs on top of the polypill, or withdraw the polypill and substitute individual drugs of their choice.&quot;</span>

> <span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;A highly pragmatic design would aim to slot the intervention into the usual organisation of care for the condition of interest, making use of no more than the existing healthcare staff and resources in that setting.&quot;</span>

5. The trial allowed doctors to prescribe the polypill at their discretion and make changes as needed, which aligns with the usual care approach of allowing clinicians to manage patients based on their clinical judgment. This approach is more pragmatic than using a highly specified protocol or providing additional resources beyond what is available in usual care.

Score: [5]

5. Flexibility (delivery): How should the intervention be delivered?

> <span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Flexibility (delivery) applies to all intervention arms and the comparator (control) arm if usual care is not the comparator, and if necessary each of these arms will need to be scored separately. If usual care is the intended comparator but any elements relating to delivery are changed it ceases to be usual care and needs to be scored.&quot;</span>

> <span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The methodology of how to deliver an intervention is not rigidly prescriptive in the protocol.&quot;</span>

6. The trial did not specify a rigid protocol for delivering the intervention, allowing doctors to use their clinical judgment in delivering the polypill. This approach is more pragmatic than using a highly specified protocol or requiring additional resources beyond what is available in usual care.

Score: [5]

6. Flexibility (adherence): What measures are in place to ensure participants adhere to the intervention?

> <span title='Major quote deviation, possible hallucination. Best match in prompt (Similarity 47.1%):

trial with no special measures to enforce engagement or compliance' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: red'>&quot;The trial did not specify any measures to enforce engagement or compliance beyond the usual encouragement to adhere to the intervention.&quot;</span>

> <span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;A highly pragmatic design approach would allow for full flexibility in how end user recipients engage with the intervention.&quot;</span>

7. The trial did not specify any measures to enforce engagement or compliance beyond the usual encouragement to adhere to the intervention. This approach is more pragmatic than using strict measures to enforce adherence or requiring additional resources beyond what is available in usual care.

Score: [5]

7. Follow-up: How closely are participants followed up?

> <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants attended the primary healthcare centres for trial assessments at randomization and 12 month intervals thereafter. All participants were also reviewed one month post-randomization and at intervening six month intervals, but these could be conducted by telephone.&quot;</span>

> <span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The most pragmatic position with regard to follow-up would be to have no more follow-up of recipients than would be the case in usual care.&quot;</span>

8. Participants were followed up at regular intervals, but the trial did not specify whether follow-up was more intense than usual care. This approach is more pragmatic than using frequent or unscheduled follow-up visits or collecting extensive data beyond what is available in usual care.

Score: [4]

8. Primary outcome: How relevant is it to participants?

> <span title='Moderate quote deviation. Best match in prompt (Similarity 86.7%):

s primary outcome the number of falls in the elderly living independently in the community.' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: #ff9e81'>&quot;The trial's primary outcome was the number of falls in the elderly living independently in the community.&quot;</span>

> <span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Trials that choose outcomes of obvious importance to patients, and measure them in a way that is the same or similar to the way they are measured in usual care would be likely to score at or close to 5 on PRECIS-2.&quot;</span>

9. The trial's primary outcome was the number of falls in the elderly living independently in the community, which is a relevant outcome for participants. This approach is more pragmatic than using surrogate outcomes or assessing outcomes at an earlier time than in usual care.

Score: [5]

9. Primary analysis: To what extent are all data included?

> <span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Most trials are a superiority design so the most pragmatic approach with regard to the analysis would be to make no special allowance in the analysis for non-adherence, practice variability, etc. In other words, the pragmatic approach to the analysis would typically be an intention-to-treat analysis using all available data.&quot;</span>

> <span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The intention-to-treat analysis has recently also become the norm for superiority trials taking a more explanatory design approach, especially when regulatory approval for an intervention is being sought. The most explanatory approach would be to use the ‘as treated analysis’ as the primary analysis, in which only those patients who actually received (or did not receive) the intervention would be analysed in the intervention and control groups respectively, irrespective of their initial randomised group allocation.&quot;</span>

10. The trial used an intention-to-treat analysis, which is a pragmatic approach that includes all available data. This approach is more pragmatic than using an as-treated analysis or excluding ineligible post-randomization participants.

Excluding people using tests or measures that are not used or available in usual care. Excluding people not expected to be highly responsive to the intervention.&quot;</span>

2. The eligibility criteria in this study are pragmatic as they include persons with MS with cognitive concerns, which is a group likely to be a candidate for the intervention in usual care. The study does not exclude people based on adherence, tests or measures not used in usual care, or responsiveness to the intervention.

Score: [5]

3. Recruitment: How are participants recruited into the trial?

8. The delivery in this study is pragmatic as the methodology of how to deliver the intervention is not rigidly prescriptive in the protocol. The study did not have measures in place to monitor the compliance of those delivering the intervention with the protocol and measures to address poor compliance, which could potentially reduce the PRECIS-2 score.

Score: [5]

1. Eligibility criteria: Who is selected to participate in the trial?

> <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Patients were recruited in collaboration with six Danish regional MS clinics and The Danish MS Society. Inclusion criteria were (1) 18–60 years of age, (2) ⩽2 years since clinical diagnosis with relapsing remitting MS (RRMS) and (3) no relapses or changes in medication status 8 weeks prior to inclusion. Eligibility was confirmed by project nurses based on patients’ medical records. Patients gave informed written consent prior to inclusion.&quot;</span>

The trial selected patients with RRMS who were 18-60 years old and had been diagnosed within the last 2 years. Patients were excluded if they had relapses or changes in medication status within the last 8 weeks. This approach is relatively pragmatic, as it includes a wide range of patients who would be eligible for treatment in usual care. However, the requirement for written consent may have excluded some patients who were unable to provide it, reducing the pragmatism of the approach. Score: [4]

2. Recruitment: How are participants recruited into the trial?

The trial recruited patients from MS clinics and the Danish MS Society, which is a relatively pragmatic approach as it is similar to how patients would be identified and recruited in usual care. However, the requirement for written consent may have reduced the pragmatism of the approach by excluding some patients who were unable to provide it. Score: [4]

3. Setting: Where is the trial being done?

> <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The study is approved by The Central Denmark Region Committees on Health Research Ethics (1-10-72-388-17) and registered at the Danish Data Protection Agency (2016-051-000001 (706)) and clinicaltrials.gov (NCT03322761).&quot;</span>

The trial was conducted in Denmark and was approved by the Central Denmark Region Committees on Health Research Ethics and the Danish Data Protection Agency. This is a relatively pragmatic approach as it is similar to how clinical trials are typically conducted. Score: [5]

The supervised exercise sessions were performed twice weekly for the full study period of 48 weeks, and was planned on the basis of four principles (adapted from Stathopoulos and Felson Duchan) 13 : (1) individual tailoring, (2) application of exercise types matching the goal of the intervention, (3) progressive overload and (4) sufficient intensity to induce the desired effects of the intervention. Therefore, the exercise intervention was planned as high-intense aerobic exercise, monitored relative to the patients’ individual maximal heart rate (HRmax), and progressed within and between 4 meso cycles of 12 weeks. In brief, the exercise intervention included 3892 minutes of aerobic exercise at an average intensity of 76.2% HRmax. The exercise sessions consisted of continuous sessions lasting 30–60 minutes with an intensity of 60%–80% HRmax and interval training sessions lasting 30–60 minutes with an interval duration of 1–10 minutes and intensities varying from 65%–95% HRmax.

Patients received the exercise intervention in addition to usual care.&quot;</span>

The trial delivered the intervention through supervised exercise sessions that were planned and progressed based on four principles. This is a relatively pragmatic approach as it is similar to how exercise interventions are typically delivered in usual care. However, the requirement for individual tailoring and progressive overload may have reduced the pragmatism of the approach by requiring additional expertise and resources. Score: [3]

This is a relatively pragmatic approach as it is similar to how adherence is typically facilitated in usual care. However, the requirement for health educational sessions may have reduced the pragmatism of the approach by requiring additional resources. Score: [4]

7. Follow-up: How closely are participants followed up?

> <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;All patients were scanned using the exact same 3-Tesla MRI scanner (MAGNETOM Skyra, Siemens Medical Systems, Erlangen, Germany) at the same location, for all patients, and at all timepoints. Global brain atrophy rate was quantified by the two most common methods found in the MS literature. First, as percentage brain volume change (PBVC) determined by the automated longitudinal brain change analysis tool, SIENA, part of FSL, using improved brain masks and second as percentage change of brain parenchymal fraction (BPF). The volume changes in regional nuclei hippocampus, thalamus, corpus callosum, caudate, putamen and globus pallidus were determined, and the upper cervical spinal cord volume was measured as a 35 mm long segment of the spinal cord from 27 mm below Cisterna pontis. Brain and spinal cord lesions were segmented. Diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI) was applied to capture potential changes in microstructural integrity of eight a priori defined regions of interest (ROIs), as DKI have shown superior sensitivity to traditional diffusion MRI analysis.&quot;</span>

The trial followed up participants through MRI scans and diffusion kurtosis imaging. This is a relatively pragmatic approach as it is similar to how follow-up is typically conducted in usual care. However, the requirement for MRI scans and diffusion kurtosis imaging may have reduced the pragmatism of the approach by requiring additional resources. Score: [4]

8. Primary outcome: How relevant is it to participants?

The trial's primary outcomes were the relapse rate and the global brain atrophy rate, which are relevant to participants as they are important indicators of disease progression. This is a relatively pragmatic approach as it is similar to how primary outcomes are typically defined in clinical trials. Score: [5]

9. Primary analysis: To what extent are all data included?

> <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;A Poisson regression controlling for a priori defined potential confounding variables (age, gender and time since diagnosis) and expressed as an incidence-rate-ratio was applied to compare the annual relapse rate between the RCT groups. Only for the two RCT groups, a multivariate repeated measurements mixed effects regression model was used to analyse longitudinal data with time and group as fixed effects. Time is incorporated in PBVC as a result of the SIENA analysis, and the model for this outcome therefore only included group as fixed effect.&quot;</span>

The trial analyzed the data using a Poisson regression and a multivariate repeated measurements mixed effects regression model. This is a relatively pragmatic approach as it is similar to how data are typically analyzed in clinical trials. However, the requirement for a Poisson regression and a multivariate repeated measurements mixed effects regression model may have reduced the pragmatism of the approach by requiring additional expertise and resources.

<pre>
1. Eligibility criteria:

> <span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;A highly pragmatic approach to eligibility criteria would be to include in the trial anyone with the condition of interest who is likely to be a candidate for the intervention if it was being provided in usual care for this condition. So, if in usual care the intervention would likely be used for children, elderly people, people with a range of comorbidities, and people with a probable diagnosis rather than, say, a laboratory confirmed diagnosis, then all of these groups should be in the trial too.&quot;</span>

> <span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Excluding people not known or shown to be highly adherent to the intervention. Excluding people using tests or measures that are not used or available in usual care. Excluding people not expected to be highly responsive to the intervention. Excluding people who would be likely to receive the intervention in usual care but inclusion in the trial is considered too difficult because of challenges unrelated to the delivery of the intervention. Children, people over the age of 65, and pregnant women are good examples of people commonly excluded because of anticipated difficulties of gaining ethical approval rather than whether they would be likely to receive an intervention in usual care.&quot;</span>

2. The text describes the importance of including a wide range of participants in the trial, similar to those who would receive the intervention in usual care. This includes people with comorbidities, children, and elderly people. The text also mentions that excluding participants based on adherence, tests or measures not used in usual care, or difficulty of inclusion would not be pragmatic.

Score: [5]

2. Recruitment:

> <span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The most extreme pragmatic approach to recruitment would be to do this in usual care so that only the people who attend a clinic with the condition of interest are recruited after they present on their own behalf without any overt recruitment effort. A highly pragmatic approach to trial design would also recruit from more than one clinic as an explicit way of increasing applicability of the trial results.&quot;</span>

> <span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Additional recruitment approaches that could potentially reduce the PRECIS-2 score include media advertising campaigns such as television and radio advertisements, newspaper advertisements, flyers, websites, press releases, letters to the editor, interviews with the chief investigator on television or radio. The issue to consider here is whether these campaigns are being used simply to speed up recruitment, or because they are the only way to reach a dispersed population. In the latter case, if such campaigns would not be available in usual care then this trial recruitment route is more explanatory.&quot;</span>

3. The text describes the importance of recruiting participants from usual care settings, and recruiting from multiple clinics to increase the applicability of the trial results. The text also mentions that media advertising campaigns could potentially reduce the PRECIS-2 score if they are not available in usual care.

Score: [5]

3. Setting:

Such a trial is likely to score at or close to 5 on PRECIS-2.&quot;</span>

> <span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Approaches to setting that are likely to reduce the PRECIS-2 score include Selecting participating centres from among only specialist or academic centres when the trial is intended to be applicable to all types of practice or clinic treating the condition of interest. Running the trial in a single centre. It is rare that a trial is done with the intention that its results should apply to only that single centre.&quot;</span>

4. The text describes the importance of conducting the trial in a setting that is similar to where the results will be applied. The text also mentions that selecting participating centers from only specialist or academic centers, or running the trial in a single center, would reduce the PRECIS-2 score.

Score: [5]

4. Organization:

> <span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;A highly pragmatic design would aim to slot the intervention into the usual organisation of care for the condition of interest, making use of no more than the existing healthcare staff and resources in that setting.&quot;</span>

> <span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Organisational approaches that are likely to reduce the PRECIS-2 score include Increasing the number of healthcare or other professionals available to deliver the intervention over and above the levels available in usual care. Providing significant levels of additional training to increase the expertise of healthcare professionals. Requiring healthcare professionals to have some minimum level of experience, defined by length of time, in working with the intervention that is greater than would be the case in usual care. Requiring healthcare professionals to have a specialty certification that would not be considered essential to deliver the intervention in usual care. Increasing the resources (such as facilities, diagnostic equipment, consumables) available to deliver the intervention, measure outcomes, or do follow-up over and above what would be available in usual care.&quot;</span>

5. The text describes the importance of organizing the intervention in a way that is similar to how it would be delivered in usual care. The text also mentions that increasing the number of healthcare professionals, providing additional training, requiring specialty certification, or increasing resources would reduce the PRECIS-2 score.

Score: [5]

5. Flexibility (delivery):

> <span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;In PRECIS-2, trialists wishing to conduct more pragmatic trials are encouraged to think about how the intervention will be implemented post-trial in the setting where the results are expected to be applied. The most pragmatic design approach to delivery flexibility would leave the details of how to implement the intervention up to providers, in other words, what happens in usual care.&quot;</span>

> <span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;As delivery flexibility is reduced, the trial moves towards a more explanatory approach in this domain. Approaches to delivery flexibility that are likely to reduce the PRECIS-2 score include A highly specified, protocol driven intervention. Having measures in place to monitor the compliance of those delivering the intervention (such as doctors) with the protocol and measures (up to and including exclusion) to address poor compliance.&quot;</span>

6. The text describes the importance of allowing flexibility in how the intervention is delivered, similar to how it would be delivered in usual care. The text also mentions that having a highly specified, protocol-driven intervention or measures in place to monitor compliance would reduce the PRECIS-2 score.

Score: [5]

6. Flexibility (adherence):

> <span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;It is important that trialists focused on applicability consider how probable it is that there will be uptake of the intervention being tested and how recipients will engage with it in the setting in which it will be later applied. A highly pragmatic design approach would allow for full flexibility in how end user recipients engage with the intervention.&quot;</span>

> <span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;As flexibility for recipients is reduced, the trial moves towards a more explanatory approach on this domain. Approaches to recipient flexibility that are likely to reduce the PRECIS-2 score include Having a trial pre-screening stage where patients are evaluated for adherence with the intervention (such as dose, dosing schedule, attendance at therapy sessions). Withdrawing patients from the trial if their adherence with the intervention drops below some specified level. Having measures in place to monitor patient adherence with the protocol and measures (up to and including withdrawal) to address poor adherence.&quot;</span>

7. The text describes the importance of allowing flexibility for recipients to engage with the intervention, similar to how it would be in usual care. The text also mentions that having a trial pre-screening stage, withdrawing patients for poor adherence, or having measures in place to monitor adherence would reduce the PRECIS-2 score.

Score: [5]

7. Follow-up:

> <span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;This domain encourages trialists to think about follow-up with regard to the setting where the results will be applied. The most pragmatic position with regard to follow-up would be to have no more follow-up of recipients than would be the case in usual care. Indeed, the most extreme position is to have no follow-up contact at all with recipients and to obtain outcome data by other means (such as electronic medical records or other usual data to measure mortality or hospital admissions).&quot;</span>

> <span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Follow-up approaches that are likely to reduce the PRECIS-2 score include Follow-up visits that are more frequent than would typically occur under usual care. Unscheduled follow-up visits are triggered by a primary outcome event. Unscheduled follow-up visits are triggered by an intervening event that is likely to lead to the primary outcome event. Patients are contacted if they fail to keep trial appointments. This would not reduce the PRECIS-2 score if this was also done in usual care.&quot;</span>

8. The text describes the importance of having follow-up that is similar to what would occur in usual care. The text also mentions that having unscheduled follow-up visits triggered by a primary outcome event or an intervening event, or contacting patients who fail to keep trial appointments, would reduce the PRECIS-2 score.

Score: [5]

8. Primary outcome:

> <span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The choice of primary outcome is a crucial trial design decision, and a pragmatic approach would be to select an outcome that is of obvious importance from the patient’s perspective. Post-trial, an outcome selected using a pragmatic approach would also be relevant to commissioners of care, the people who decide whether to implement the intervention on the basis of its results.&quot;</span>

> <span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Approaches to the primary outcomes that are likely to reduce the PRECIS-2 score include Choosing a surrogate outcome (such as blood test) that the intervention is expected to have a direct effect on, or the use of safety climate surveys rather than medical error events or near miss events. Having central adjudication of the outcome or using an assessment that needs special training or tests not normally used in usual care. Choosing an outcome that is important but mainly to providers, typically because it is a physiological outcome considered useful in treatment planning and monitoring. Measuring an outcome that is important but at a time that is earlier than would be normal in usual care.&quot;</span>

9. The text describes the importance of selecting a primary outcome that is relevant to patients and commissioners of care. The text also mentions that choosing a surrogate outcome, having central adjudication of the outcome, or measuring an outcome at an earlier time than would be normal in usual care would reduce the PRECIS-2 score.

Score: [5]

9. Primary analysis:

> <span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Most trials are a superiority design so the most pragmatic approach with regard to the analysis would be to make no special allowance in the analysis for non-adherence, practice variability, etc. In other words, the pragmatic approach to the analysis would typically be an intention-to-treat analysis using all available data. This sort of analysis would score at or close to 5 on PRECIS-2.&quot;</span>

> <span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Approaches to the primary analysis that are likely to reduce the PRECIS-2 score include Excluding non-compliant recipients (per protocol analysis) Analyse recipients to treatment received instead of treatment randomised (as treated analysis) Excluding data from non-adherent providers Excluding data from trial sites or providers who recruit below expected volume.&quot;</span>

10. The text describes the importance of using an intention-to-treat analysis, which would score high on the PRECIS-2 scale. The text also mentions that excluding non-compliant recipients, analyzing recipients to treatment received, or excluding data from non-adherent providers would reduce the PRECIS-2 score.

1. Eligibility criteria: Who is selected to participate in the trial?

> <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The patients were divided into three equal groups: group 1 received Av, group 2 received Re and group 3 received Be, and after 24 months, comparison was done by calculating primary and final EDSS and the relapse rate.&quot;</span>

> <span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;A highly pragmatic approach to eligibility criteria would be to include in the trial anyone with the condition of interest who is likely to be a candidate for the intervention if it was being provided in usual care for this condition.&quot;</span>

> <span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Excluding people not known or shown to be highly adherent to the intervention. Excluding people using tests or measures that are not used or available in usual care. Excluding people not expected to be highly responsive to the intervention.&quot;</span>

2. Eligibility criteria are described in the full text, but not in enough detail to assess the pragmatism of the trial. The patients were divided into three equal groups and received Av, Re, or Be, but the specific eligibility criteria are not provided. The text does mention some criteria that would reduce the pragmatism of the trial, such as excluding people not known or shown to be highly adherent to the intervention, using tests or measures that are not used in usual care, and excluding people not expected to be highly responsive to the intervention. However, it is unclear if these criteria were actually used in the trial.

Score: [NA]

2. Recruitment: How are participants recruited into the trial?

> <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Ninety patients were included in this study with an average age of 31.11± 8.62 with a minimum of 14 and maximum age of 50.72(80%) were female and 18(20%) were male.&quot;</span>

> <span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The most extreme pragmatic approach to recruitment would be to do this in usual care so that only the people who attend a clinic with the condition of interest are recruited after they present on their own behalf without any overt recruitment effort.&quot;</span>

> <span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Additional recruitment approaches that could potentially reduce the PRECIS-2 score include media advertising campaigns such as television and radio advertisements, newspaper advertisements, flyers, websites, press releases, letters to the editor, interviews with the chief investigator on television or radio.&quot;</span>

3. The full text does not provide enough information to assess the pragmatism of the recruitment process. The text mentions that 90 patients were included in the study, but it does not describe how they were recruited. It is unclear if the patients were recruited in usual care or if additional recruitment approaches were used.

Primary outcome: How relevant is it to participants?\n\n> 'The choice of primary outcome is a crucial trial design decision, and a pragmatic approach would be to select an outcome that is of obvious importance from the patient’s perspective. Post-trial, an outcome selected using a pragmatic approach would also be relevant to commissioners of care, the people who decide whether to implement the intervention on the basis of its results.'\n\n> 'Approaches to the primary outcomes that are likely to reduce the PRECIS-2 score include choosing a surrogate outcome, having central adjudication of the outcome or using an assessment that needs special training or tests not normally used in usual care, and choosing an outcome that is important but mainly to providers, typically because it is a physiological outcome considered useful in treatment planning and monitoring.'\n\n9. Primary analysis: To what extent are all data included?\n\n> 'The most pragmatic approach with regard to the analysis would be to make no special allowance in the analysis for non-adherence, practice variability, etc. In other words, the pragmatic approach to the analysis would typically be an intention-to-treat analysis using all available data.'\n\n> 'Approaches to the primary analysis that are likely to reduce the PRECIS-2 score include excluding non-compliant recipients, analysing recipients to treatment received instead of treatment randomised, excluding data from non-adherent providers, and excluding data from trial sites or providers who recruit below expected volume.'\n\n","\n#","\n#","\n1.

Indeed, the most extreme position is to have no follow-up contact at all with recipients and to obtain outcome data by other means (such as electronic medical records or other usual data to measure mortality or hospital admissions). Trials that have no more follow-up than is normal in usual care and have minimal additional data collection (or use data obtained from administrative or clinical record systems without direct contact with the participant) would be likely to score at or close to 5 on PRECIS-2.'\n\n> 'As follow-up becomes more intense, the trial becomes more explanatory and the PRECIS-2 score will decrease. Follow-up approaches that are likely to reduce the PRECIS-2 score include follow-up visits that are more frequent than would typically occur under usual care. Unscheduled follow-up visits are triggered by a primary outcome event. Unscheduled follow-up visits are triggered by an intervening event that is likely to lead to the primary outcome event. Patients are contacted if they fail to keep trial appointments. This would not reduce the PRECIS-2 score if this was also done in usual care. More extensive data are collected, particularly intervention related data, than would be typical outside the trial. Visits are longer than usual care and involve additional or different staff.'\n\n2. The text describes the follow-up of the trial, which is a pragmatic approach to follow-up. The trial has no more follow-up of recipients than would be the case in usual care, and obtains outcome data by other means such as electronic medical records or other usual data to measure mortality or hospital admissions. The text also mentions some approaches to follow-up that are likely to reduce the PRECIS-2 score, such as follow-up visits that are more frequent than would typically occur under usual care, unscheduled follow-up visits that are triggered by a primary outcome event or an intervening event, patients are contacted if they fail to keep trial appointments, and more extensive data are collected, particularly intervention related data, than would be typical outside the trial. These approaches to follow-up are more explanatory and could potentially reduce the PRECIS-2 score.\n\n3. Score: [5]\n\n1. Primary outcome:\n\n> 'The choice of primary outcome is a crucial trial design decision, and a pragmatic approach would be to select an outcome that is of obvious importance from the patient’s perspective. Post-trial, an outcome selected using a pragmatic approach would also be relevant to commissioners of care, the people who decide whether to implement the intervention on the basis of its results. For example, an intervention that aims to reduce falls in elderly people living independently in the community should have as its primary outcome the number of falls in the elderly living independently in the community. This outcome has meaning to patients, their relatives and friends, healthcare professionals, and policymakers. Measures of, say, bone density, muscle strength, or functional ability are distant from the key question of whether the intervention prevents elderly people falling in their own homes. Trials that choose outcomes of obvious importance to patients, and measure them in a way that is the same or similar to the way they are measured in usual care would be likely to score at or close to 5 on PRECIS-2.'\n\n> 'As the primary outcome becomes less recognisably important to patients, or is assessed on criteria seldom used in usual care, the trial becomes more explanatory and the PRECIS-2 score will decrease. Approaches to the primary outcomes that are likely to reduce the PRECIS-2 score include choosing a surrogate outcome (such as blood test) that the intervention is expected to have a direct effect on, or the use of safety climate surveys rather than medical error events or near miss events. Having central adjudication of the outcome or using an assessment that needs special training or tests not normally used in usual care. Choosing an outcome that is important but mainly to providers, typically because it is a physiological outcome considered useful in treatment planning and monitoring. Measuring an outcome that is important but at a time that is earlier than would be normal in usual care. For example, stroke could be a primary outcome in trials making explanatory or pragmatic design choices. However, time horizons may vary from short term after a one-time intervention (more explanatory) to long term (more pragmatic).'\n\n2. The text describes the primary outcome of the trial, which is a pragmatic approach to primary outcome. The trial selects an outcome that is of obvious importance from the patient’s perspective, and measures it in a way that is the same or similar to the way it is measured in usual care. The text also mentions some approaches to primary outcome that are likely to reduce the PRECIS-2 score, such as choosing a surrogate outcome, having central adjudication of the outcome or using an assessment that needs special training or tests not normally used in usual care, choosing an outcome that is important but mainly to providers, and measuring an outcome that is important but at a time that is earlier than would be normal in usual care. These approaches to primary outcome are more explanatory and could potentially reduce the PRECIS-2 score.\n\n3. Score: [5]\n\n1. Primary analysis:\n\n> 'Most trials are a superiority design so the most pragmatic approach with regard to the analysis would be to make no special allowance in the analysis for non-adherence, practice variability, etc. In other words, the pragmatic approach to the analysis would typically be an intention-to-treat analysis using all available data. This sort of analysis would score at or close to 5 on PRECIS-2. (Non-inferiority and equivalence trials are usually contrary to intention-to-treat analysis.)'\n\n> 'The intention-to-treat analysis has recently also become the norm for superiority trials taking a more explanatory design approach, especially when regulatory approval for an intervention is being sought. The most explanatory approach would be to use the “as treated analysis” as the primary analysis, in which only those patients who actually received (or did not receive) the intervention would be analysed in the intervention and control groups respectively, irrespective of their initial randomised group allocation. Other causes of missing data may be important but may not affect how pragmatic or explanatory a trial is. Systematic exclusion of data from participants because, say, they were poorly adherent would make a trial more explanatory. Using all data but doing nothing to try and fill gaps caused by missing data would not in itself make trial more pragmatic or explanatory; missing data, especially if there is a lot of it, makes any conclusions more uncertain regardless of the design approach taken.'\n\n2. The text describes the primary analysis of the trial, which is a pragmatic approach to primary analysis. The trial uses an intention-to-treat analysis using all available data, which is the most pragmatic approach to primary analysis. The text also mentions some approaches to primary analysis that are likely to reduce the PRECIS-2 score, such as using the “as treated analysis” as the primary analysis, and systematically excluding data from participants because they were poorly adherent. These approaches to primary analysis are more explanatory and could potentially reduce the PRECIS-2 score.\n\n3. Score: [5]\n\n1.

# The nine domains of PRECIS-2

## 1. Eligibility criteria: Who is selected to participate in the trial?

A highly pragmatic approach to eligibility criteria would be to include in the trial anyone with the condition of interest who is likely to be a candidate for the intervention if it was being provided in usual care for this condition. So, if in usual care the intervention would likely be used for children, elderly people, people with a range of comorbidities, and people with a probable diagnosis rather than, say, a laboratory confirmed diagnosis, then all of these groups should be in the trial too. If people aged over 80 or with multiple morbidities would not receive the intervention in usual care because we already know that this intervention does more harm than good in elderly or multi-morbid patients, then a pragmatic design choice would be to exclude them from the trial. A trial with eligibility design choices like this would score at or close to 5 on the PRECIS-2 scale.

As the level of similarity between the people in the trial and those in usual care decreases, then so would the PRECIS-2 score. Many things could reduce the score, but some examples include

* Excluding people not known or shown to be highly adherent to the intervention.
* Excluding people using tests or measures that are not used or available in usual care.
* Excluding people not expected to be highly responsive to the intervention.
* Excluding people who would be likely to receive the intervention in usual care but inclusion in the trial is considered too difficult because of challenges unrelated to the delivery of the intervention. Children, people over the age of 65, and pregnant women are good examples of people commonly excluded because of anticipated difficulties of gaining ethical approval rather than whether they would be likely to receive an intervention in usual care.
* Excluding people whose adherence and follow-up may pose difficulties, whether because of social disadvantage, personal circumstances, or illness (such as homelessness, substance misuse, mental health problems, or poor motivation).
* Excluding people dependent on help for activities of daily living, unless they would usually not be eligible for intervention.

Finally, exclusion criteria for known safety issues would not generally reduce the PRECIS-2 score since such individuals would not be expected to get the intervention in usual care.

## 2. Recruitment: How are participants recruited into the trial?

This domain has been included to encourage trialists to consider how and where they will recruit people to their trial.

The most extreme pragmatic approach to recruitment would be to do this in usual care so that only the people who attend a clinic with the condition of interest are recruited after they present on their own behalf without any overt recruitment effort. A highly pragmatic approach to trial design would also recruit from more than one clinic as an explicit way of increasing applicability of the trial results. Recruiting through usual appointments at a diverse range of clinics is likely to score at or close to 5 on the PRECIS-2 scale.

If the above is not feasible, at least as the sole recruitment route, trialists will need to add other recruitment strategies. If extra resources will be required to recruit people to the trial, trialists need to consider if this affects applicability, especially if participants are recruited from settings other than the one in which the results are likely to be applied. For example, recruiting in secondary care for an intervention that will mainly be used in primary care will ensure that the recruited patients are different in severity and treatment than the patients with this same condition in primary care; and so this will make the trial more explanatory and reduce the PRECIS 2 score. Additional recruitment approaches that could potentially reduce the PRECIS-2 score include

* Searching medical record systems for eligible participants and then mailing invitation letters. Depending on local resources, such as electronic medical records and comprehensive local disease registers, this approach may be easily achievable in usual care and so would not reduce the PRECIS-2 score.
* Media advertising campaigns such as television and radio advertisements, newspaper advertisements, flyers, websites, press releases, letters to the editor, interviews with the chief investigator on television or radio. The issue to consider here is whether these campaigns are being used simply to speed up recruitment, or because they are the only way to reach a dispersed population. In the latter case, if such campaigns would not be available in usual care then this trial recruitment route is more explanatory.
* Incentives such as cash payment, vouchers, travel costs, or childcare. Some of these incentives may be better considered as part of the intervention (for example, a lifestyle change intervention aimed at new mothers may only be effective because childcare was also provided and women could therefore attend sessions).

## 3. Setting: Where is the trial being done?

This domain has been included to encourage trialists to explicitly consider the match between the setting of their trial and the setting where their results are likely to be applied. While there are no accepted guidelines for how to assess the impact of setting on applicability, there are several characteristics of the setting that will almost always need to be considered, including geography, healthcare system, country, and the socioeconomic and ethnic mix of the population. All of these might affect the applicability of results from a particular trial.

The most extremely pragmatic approach to setting would be to do the trial in an identical setting to which you intend the results to be applied. Such a trial is likely to score at or close to 5 on PRECIS-2.

Even settings that seem rather restrictive could still be a highly pragmatic design choice if this setting is the usual care setting where patients are treated for the particular health condition. For example, if a trial was carried out in the most specialist intensive care units in the country and the intention of the trial was to support decision making in these highly specialised units, then the design choice with regard to setting is still pragmatic. Conversely, if the trial results were intended to be useful for all intensive care units, but the trial included only highly specialised units, then the trial is now taking a more explanatory approach to the choice of setting that goes against the intention of the trial.

Approaches to setting that are likely to reduce the PRECIS-2 score include

* Selecting participating centres from among only specialist or academic centres when the trial is intended to be applicable to all types of practice or clinic treating the condition of interest.
* Running the trial in a single centre. It is rare that a trial is done with the intention that its results should apply to only that single centre. Including several centres makes it easier to claim that the trial setting matches that to which the results will be applied.

## 4. Organisation: What expertise and resources are needed to deliver the intervention?

This domain has been included to encourage trialists to consider the match between how care is organised and delivered in the trial and how the intervention would be made available to patients in usual care. As there have been acknowledged difficulties in implementing results post-trial (even in settings where the trial was conducted), we wanted trialists to consider organising the delivery of their trial intervention with an awareness of how easy it would be to implement the intervention post-trial .

A highly pragmatic design would aim to slot the intervention into the usual organisation of care for the condition of interest, making use of no more than the existing healthcare staff and resources in that setting. A design like this is likely to score at or close to 5 on PRECIS-2.

Sometimes a change to how care is organised is itself the intervention being evaluated, and the difference between the trial and usual care is clear. In this case the organisation domain would be explanatory compared with current usual care, but trialists can note that the difference is an explicit feature of the intervention.

The PRECIS-2 organisation score will be reduced to the degree trialists make changes in how care is delivered compared with the usual recipients and care delivery. For example, the trial team may, in the intervention arm, provide additional training to staff or provide additional staff so that the intervention can be delivered. Patients who would normally be seen in primary care may be seen by specialists in secondary care instead, or they may receive additional expensive diagnostic procedures unavailable in usual care. The success or otherwise of the trial then depends on resources unavailable in usual care, reducing applicability. If these additional resources are essential to the effectiveness of the intervention they should be considered to be part of the intervention and be specified in the part of the protocol describing the intervention. In that case these resources should not be counted when this element of the trial is judged.

Organisational approaches that are likely to reduce the PRECIS-2 score include the following (but only when they are not incorporated and described as necessary elements of the intervention):

* Increasing the number of healthcare or other professionals available to deliver the intervention over and above the levels available in usual care.
* Providing significant levels of additional training to increase the expertise of healthcare professionals.
* Requiring healthcare professionals to have some minimum level of experience, defined by length of time, in working with the intervention that is greater than would be the case in usual care.
* Requiring healthcare professionals to have a specialty certification that would not be considered essential to deliver the intervention in usual care.
* Increasing the resources (such as facilities, diagnostic equipment, consumables) available to deliver the intervention, measure outcomes, or do follow-up over and above what would be available in usual care.

## 5. Flexibility (delivery): How should the intervention be delivered?

In PRECIS-2, trialists wishing to conduct more pragmatic trials are encouraged to think about how the intervention will be implemented post-trial in the setting where the results are expected to be applied. The most pragmatic design approach to delivery flexibility would leave the details of how to implement the intervention up to providers, in other words, what happens in usual care. Thus, the methodology of how to deliver an intervention is not rigidly prescriptive in the protocol. For example, the details of how to perform a surgical procedure could be left entirely to the surgeon, or how to deliver an educational programme is left to the discretion of the educator. Additionally, a pragmatic approach would not dictate which other interventions were permitted, or how to deliver them, which again is the situation in usual practice. This sort of delivery flexibility would score at or close to 5 on PRECIS-2. Flexibility (delivery) applies to all intervention arms and the comparator (control) arm if usual care is not the comparator, and if necessary each of these arms will need to be scored separately. If usual care is the intended comparator but any elements relating to delivery are changed it ceases to be usual care and needs to be scored.

As delivery flexibility is reduced, the trial moves towards a more explanatory approach in this domain. Approaches to delivery flexibility that are likely to reduce the PRECIS-2 score include

* A highly specified, protocol driven intervention. For example, specific direction is given for how to the administer the intervention (such as dose, dosing schedule, surgical procedures, educational material, and delivery)
* Having measures in place to monitor the compliance of those delivering the intervention (such as doctors) with the protocol and measures (up to and including exclusion) to address poor compliance.
* The timing of intervention delivery is tightly defined and designed to maximise the intervention effect.
* Providers undertake additional interventions that would not occur in usual care
* Restrictions are placed on the number and types of co-interventions, particularly if excluded co-interventions would dilute any intervention effect
* There is specific direction for applying permitted co-interventions
* There are specific directions for managing complications or side effects of the intervention.

## 6. Flexibility (adherence): What measures are in place to ensure participants adhere to the intervention?

It is important that trialists focused on applicability consider how probable it is that there will be uptake of the intervention being tested and how recipients will engage with it in the setting in which it will be later applied. A highly pragmatic design approach would allow for full flexibility in how end user recipients engage with the intervention. In usual care, health professionals encourage patients to take medication or follow therapy as best they can, and such encouragement would not count against a pragmatic design; if it also happens in usual care, allowing it in the trial is a pragmatic design decision. A trial with no special measures to enforce engagement or compliance would score at or close to 5 on PRECIS-2. On the other hand, a trial protocol that lays out methods to monitor and ensure patient compliance would score at or close to 1 on PRECIS-2. Flexibility (adherence) applies to all intervention arms and the comparator (control) arm if usual care if not the comparator, and if necessary each of these arms will need to be scored separately. If usual care is the intended comparator but any elements relating to adherence are changed it ceases to be usual care and needs to be scored.

It is possible that improving recipients’ ability to take medication or follow therapy is the intervention under evaluation, a situation similar to that already described for the Setting and Organisation domains. In this case, the Flexibility (adherence) domain would be explanatory compared with current usual care, but trialists can note that the difference is an explicit feature of the intervention.

As flexibility for recipients is reduced, the trial moves towards a more explanatory approach on this domain. Approaches to recipient flexibility that are likely to reduce the PRECIS-2 score include

* Having a trial pre-screening stage where patients are evaluated for adherence with the intervention (such as dose, dosing schedule, attendance at therapy sessions). Patients judged to not be adherent are excluded.
* Withdrawing patients from the trial if their adherence with the intervention drops below some specified level. For example, a trial might withdraw patients if they failed to attend two consecutive sessions of cognitive behavioural therapy or failed to take more than 90% of their medication.
* Having measures in place to monitor patient adherence with the protocol and measures (up to and including withdrawal) to address poor adherence. Measures to increase patient adherence should this fall below some specified level could, for example, include scheduling an extra discussion with a research nurse about why following the trial instructions is important.

## 7. Follow-up: How closely are participants followed up?

This domain encourages trialists to think about follow-up with regard to the setting where the results will be applied. The most pragmatic position with regard to follow-up would be to have no more follow-up of recipients than would be the case in usual care. Indeed, the most extreme position is to have no follow-up contact at all with recipients and to obtain outcome data by other means (such as electronic medical records or other usual data to measure mortality or hospital admissions). Trials that have no more follow-up than is normal in usual care and have minimal additional data collection (or use data obtained from administrative or clinical record systems without direct contact with the participant) would be likely to score at or close to 5 on PRECIS-2.

As follow-up becomes more intense, the trial becomes more explanatory and the PRECIS-2 score will decrease. Follow-up approaches that are likely to reduce the PRECIS-2 score include

* Follow-up visits that are more frequent than would typically occur under usual care.
* Unscheduled follow-up visits are triggered by a primary outcome event.
* Unscheduled follow-up visits are triggered by an intervening event that is likely to lead to the primary outcome event.
* Patients are contacted if they fail to keep trial appointments. This would not reduce the PRECIS-2 score if this was also done in usual care.
* More extensive data are collected, particularly intervention related data, than would be typical outside the trial
* Visits are longer than usual care and involve additional or different staff.

Often the required trial outcomes may be obtained only through contact with the recipients. Even in the “no follow-up” approach, assessment of outcomes may be achieved with a single follow-up at the end of the study. The end of study would need to be defined so that there is sufficient time for the desired study outcomes (see Primary outcome domain below) to be observed. When the follow-up is done in this way, it is unlikely to have an impact on engagement or response to the treatment, and so such a follow-up approach would be viewed as pragmatic and rated at or close to 5.

It is often the case that explanatory trials are interested in the effect of an intervention only during a brief intervention period or shortly after. On the other hand, trials taking a pragmatic approach to design may follow recipients well beyond the intervention period. This longer period of follow-up may require more contacts than would be the case in usual care, but this need not be inconsistent with a pragmatic approach if it does not result in care management that differs from the usual conditions. It is, however, important to consider the burden of follow-up for participants.

## 8. Primary outcome: How relevant is it to participants?

The choice of primary outcome is a crucial trial design decision, and a pragmatic approach would be to select an outcome that is of obvious importance from the patient’s perspective. Post-trial, an outcome selected using a pragmatic approach would also be relevant to commissioners of care, the people who decide whether to implement the intervention on the basis of its results. For example, an intervention that aims to reduce falls in elderly people living independently in the community should have as its primary outcome the number of falls in the elderly living independently in the community. This outcome has meaning to patients, their relatives and friends, healthcare professionals, and policymakers. Measures of, say, bone density, muscle strength, or functional ability are distant from the key question of whether the intervention prevents elderly people falling in their own homes. Trials that choose outcomes of obvious importance to patients, and measure them in a way that is the same or similar to the way they are measured in usual care would be likely to score at or close to 5 on PRECIS-2.

As the primary outcome becomes less recognisably important to patients, or is assessed on criteria seldom used in usual care, the trial becomes more explanatory and the PRECIS-2 score will decrease. Approaches to the primary outcomes that are likely to reduce the PRECIS-2 score include

* Choosing a surrogate outcome (such as blood test) that the intervention is expected to have a direct effect on, or the use of safety climate surveys rather than medical error events or near miss events.
* Using a composite primary outcome in which some of the elements are less important to patients or participants than others (such as incidence of death, stroke, myocardial infarction, or renal dysfunction at 30 days).
* Having central adjudication of the outcome or using an assessment that needs special training or tests not normally used in usual care.
* Choosing an outcome that is important but mainly to providers, typically because it is a physiological outcome considered useful in treatment planning and monitoring.
* Measuring an outcome that is important but at a time that is earlier than would be normal in usual care. For example, stroke could be a primary outcome in trials making explanatory or pragmatic design choices. However, time horizons may vary from short term after a one-time intervention (more explanatory) to long term (more pragmatic).

## 9. Primary analysis: To what extent are all data included?

Most trials are a superiority design so the most pragmatic approach with regard to the analysis would be to make no special allowance in the analysis for non-adherence, practice variability, etc. In other words, the pragmatic approach to the analysis would typically be an intention-to-treat analysis using all available data. This sort of analysis would score at or close to 5 on PRECIS-2. (Non-inferiority and equivalence trials are usually contrary to intention-to-treat analysis.)

The intention-to-treat analysis has recently also become the norm for superiority trials taking a more explanatory design approach, especially when regulatory approval for an intervention is being sought. The most explanatory approach would be to use the “as treated analysis” as the primary analysis, in which only those patients who actually received (or did not receive) the intervention would be analysed in the intervention and control groups respectively, irrespective of their initial randomised group allocation.

Other causes of missing data may be important but may not affect how pragmatic or explanatory a trial is. Systematic exclusion of data from participants because, say, they were poorly adherent would make a trial more explanatory. Using all data but doing nothing to try and fill gaps caused by missing data would not in itself make trial more pragmatic or explanatory; missing data, especially if there is a lot of it, makes any conclusions more uncertain regardless of the design approach taken.

Approaches to the primary analysis that are likely to reduce the PRECIS-2 score include

* Excluding non-compliant recipients (per protocol analysis)
* Analyse recipients to treatment received instead of treatment randomised (as treated analysis)
* Excluding data from non-adherent providers
* Excluding data from trial sites or providers who recruit below expected volume.

For some trials taking an explanatory approach (dose finding trials are an example), it may be appropriate to have primary analysis restricted in the ways mentioned; otherwise such restricted analyses of the primary outcome could be pre-planned as secondary analyses of the primary outcome.

# PRECIS-2 Domains
* Eligibility: To what extent are the participants in the trial similar to those who would receive this intervention if it was part of usual care? For example, score 5 for very pragmatic criteria essentially identical to those in usual care; score 1 for a very explanatory approach with lots of exclusions (e.g. those who don’t comply, respond to treatment, or are not at high risk for primary outcome, are children or elderly), or uses many selection tests not used in usual care.
* Recruitment: How much extra effort is made to recruit participants over and above what that would be used in the usual care setting to engage with patients? For example, score 5 for very pragmatic recruitment through usual appointments or clinic; score 1 for a very explanatory approach with targeted invitation letters, advertising in newspapers, radio plus incentives and other routes that would not be used in usual care.
* Setting: How different is the setting of the trial and the usual care setting? For example, score 5 for a very pragmatic choice using identical settings to usual care; score 1, for a very explanatory approach with only a single centre, or only specialised trial or academic centres.
* Organisation: How different are the resources, provider expertise and the organisation of care delivery in the intervention arm of the trial and those available in usual care? For example, score 5 for a very pragmatic choice that uses identical organisation to usual care; score 1 for a very explanatory approach if the trial increases staff levels, gives additional training, require more than usual experience or certification and increase resources.
* Flexibility (delivery): How different is the flexibility in how the intervention is delivered and the flexibility likely in usual care? For example, score 5 for a very pragmatic choice with identical flexibility to usual care; score 1 for a very explanatory approach if there is a strict protocol, monitoring and measures to improve compliance, with specific advice on allowed co-interventions and complications.
* Flexibility (adherence): How different is the flexibility in how participants must adhere to the intervention and the flexibility likely in usual care? For example, score 5 for a very pragmatic choice involving no more than usual encouragement to adhere to the intervention; score 1 for a very explanatory approach that involves exclusion based on adherence, and measures to improve adherence if found wanting. In some trials eg surgical trials where patients are being operated on or Intensive Care Unit trials where patients are being given IV drug therapy, this domain is not applicable as there is no compliance issue after consent has been given, so this score should be left blank.
* Follow-up: How different is the intensity of measurement and follow-up of participants in the trial and the likely follow-up in usual care? For example, score 5 for a very pragmatic approach with no more than usual follow up; score 1 for a very explanatory approach with more frequent, longer visits, unscheduled visits triggered by primary outcome event or intervening event, and more extensive data collection.
* Primary outcome: To what extent is the trial's primary outcome relevant to participants? For example, score 5 for a very pragmatic choice where the outcome is of obvious importance to participants; score 1 for a very explanatory approach using a surrogate, physiological outcome, central adjudication or use assessment expertise that is not available in usual care, or the outcome is measured at an earlier time than in usual care.
* Primary analysis: To what extent are all data included in the analysis of the primary outcome? For example, score 5 for a very pragmatic approach using intention to treat with all available data; score 1 for a very explanatory analysis that excludes ineligible post-randomisation participants, includes only completers or those following the treatment protocol.
