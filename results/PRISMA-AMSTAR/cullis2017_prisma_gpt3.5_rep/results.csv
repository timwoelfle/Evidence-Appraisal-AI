Although some studies have challenged the role varicocele plays in infertility, many studies have stated that varicocele is associated with testicular atrophy and abnormal seminal parameters contributing to male infertility. Surgical management of adolescent varicocele has been advocated to preserve future fertility. The earlier the patient undergoes varicocele repair, the more likely the testis will recover from a varicocele-induced injury. Currently, several techniques are successfully used for varicocelectomy including open surgical ligation via a subinguinal, inguinal or retroperitoneal approach, and microsurgical and laparoscopic procedures.

Although, HD group had slightly shorter hospital stay (MD: 0.30; 95% CI: −0.22–0.39; P < 0.00001) it showed a higher incidence of postoperative reflux/gastritis (OR: 0.08; 95% CI: − 0.02–0.39; P = 0.002).

First, there are no randomized trials comparing the two procedures.

Second, except one study, the others did not compare outcomes between the laparoscopic and open group within the same study period, the main drawback in drawing conclusions from different study period is that factors other than the surgical approach, such as changes in perioperative practices or improved equipment, may introduce bias. Third, in some studies, the number of patients was too small, leading to low-power analyses. Caution should be given in the interpretation and generalization of this meta-analysis as the included study numbers are not high and also the overall quantity of these studies is insufficient.

P25. Discussion / Limitations: ""This meta-analysis has some limitations that should be taken into account when considering the results. First, there are no randomized trials comparing the two procedures. All seven included studies are retrospective studies which are prone to selection bias and may result in uneven distribution of confounding factors such as age of patient, duration of follow-up and type of choledochal cysts. Second, except one study, the others did not compare outcomes between the laparoscopic and open group within the same study period, the main drawback in drawing conclusions from different study period is that factors other than the surgical approach, such as changes in perioperative practices or improved equipment, may introduce bias. Third, in some studies, the number of patients was too small, leading to low-power analyses. Caution should be given in the interpretation and generalization of this meta-analysis as the included study numbers are not high and also the overall quantity of these studies is insufficient. At last, heterogeneity among the studies is high.""
