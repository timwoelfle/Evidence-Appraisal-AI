A1. Was an 'a priori' design provided? [Yes]
Quotes: ""In order to be as comprehensive as possible, the following search strategies were employed to identify all relevant studies irrespective of language.""
Reasoning: The review had a predefined protocol for literature search and inclusion/exclusion criteria. 

A2. Was there duplicate study selection and data extraction? [Yes]  
Quotes: ""Two reviewers independently assessed trial quality."" ""Two observers independently extracted the results of each paper on a data sheet""  
Reasoning: Two independent reviewers performed study selection and data extraction.

A3. Was a comprehensive literature search performed? [Yes]
Quotes: ""We searched the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, LILACS, CNKI, SciSearch, study registries, and the congress proceedings of endoscopic surgical societies.""
Reasoning: Multiple databases were searched along with supplementary strategies like screening references and contacting experts.

A4. Was the status of publication used as an inclusion criterion? [No]  
Quotes: No mention of including or excluding studies based on publication status.
Reasoning: The review does not state whether unpublished studies or grey literature were sought. 

A5. Was a list of studies (included and excluded) provided? [Yes]  
Quotes: References for included and excluded studies are provided. 
Reasoning: Lists of included and excluded studies with citations are provided.

A6. Were the characteristics of the included studies provided? [Yes]
Quotes: Table describing characteristics like participants, interventions, outcomes for each included study.
Reasoning: Characteristics of included studies summarized in a table.

A7. Was the scientific quality of the included studies assessed and documented? [Yes] 
Quotes: ""Risk of bias"" table with judgments about methodological quality of each study.
Reasoning: The review authors assessed risk of bias in included studies and presented the results in a table. 

A8. Was the scientific quality of the included studies used appropriately in formulating conclusions? [Yes]  
Quotes: ""In conclusion, laparoscopic surgery for suspected appendicitis has diagnostic and therapeutic advantages as compared to conventional surgery. However, conventional appendectomy should not be considered 'wrong'.""
Reasoning: The conclusions acknowledge the limitations of included studies while interpreting the results.

A9. Were the methods used to combine the findings of studies appropriate? [Yes] 
Quotes: ""For dichotomous outcomes..Peto's odds ratios were calculated...For continuous variables...means with their corresponding standard deviations are needed to calculate weighted or standardized mean differences.""  
Reasoning: Appropriate statistical methods were used for pooling results and assessing heterogeneity. 

A10. Was the likelihood of publication bias assessed? [No]
Quotes: No assessment of publication bias mentioned.
Reasoning: Publication bias was not assessed.

A11. Was the conflict of interest included? [Yes] 
Quotes: ""None"" in the Declaration of Interest section.
Reasoning: The review states there were no conflicts of interest.

P1. Identify the report as a systematic review. [Yes]  
Quotes: ""Laparoscopic versus open surgery for suspected appendicitis (Review)""
Reasoning: The report is identified as a Cochrane systematic review.

P2. Provide a structured summary. [Yes]  
Quotes: The abstract provides a structured summary with background, objectives, methods, results, and conclusions.
Reasoning: A structured abstract is provided.

P3. Describe the rationale for the review. [Yes]   
Quotes: ""The evolution of endoscopic surgery led to the idea of performing appendectomy in laparoscopy, which was first described by Semm in 1983. Nevertheless, the new method has only partly gained acceptance, because the advantages of laparoscopic appendectomy were not as obvious as for laparoscopic cholecystectomy.""
Reasoning: The background section describes the rationale for comparing laparoscopic and open appendectomy.

P4. Provide an explicit statement of questions addressed. [Yes]
Quotes: ""This review compares laparoscopic and conventional surgery with regard to several peri- and post-operative variables."" 
Reasoning: The objectives section explicitly states the questions addressed regarding comparing laparoscopic and open appendectomy.

P5. Indicate if a review protocol exists. [No] 
Quotes: No mention of a protocol.
Reasoning: The review does not indicate if a protocol exists. 

P6. Specify study characteristics used as criteria for eligibility. [Yes]   
Quotes: The types of studies, participants, interventions, and outcomes used to determine eligibility are described in the methods section.
Reasoning: Details on study eligibility criteria are provided.

P7. Describe all information sources in the search. [Yes]

In summary, the review appears to have substantial methodological limitations based on AMSTAR and PRISMA assessments.

Overall, I would rate this as a low quality systematic review with high risk of bias. Caution should be taken when interpreting the results.

In summary, the review appears to have substantial methodological limitations based on AMSTAR and PRISMA assessments. Key issues are the lack of duplicate study selection/data extraction, risk of bias assessment, details on screening and selection process, and quantitative synthesis. The reporting is fairly poor. Overall, I would rate this as a low quality systematic review with high risk of bias. Caution should be taken when interpreting the results.

In summary, the review adequately reported the majority of AMSTAR and PRISMA items, with some exceptions:

- AMSTAR: An a priori protocol was not provided, individual study quality/risk of bias was not assessed, publication bias was not assessed, conflicts of interest were not reported.  

- PRISMA: The full search strategy was not provided, methods for assessing risk of bias were not described, assessment of publication bias was not performed.

Overall, this review provides moderate quality evidence on operative fascial closure versus silo repair for gastroschisis due to the observational study designs, heterogeneity, and some deficiencies in reporting. The results suggest some advantages for operative fascial closure but high quality randomized trials are needed.

A1. Was an 'a priori' design provided? The research question and inclusion criteria should be established before the conduct of the review. Note: Need to refer to a protocol, ethics approval, or pre-determined/a priori published research objectives to score a “yes.” 
[No] No a priori design or protocol was mentioned.

A2. Was there duplicate study selection and data extraction? There should be at least two independent data extractors and a consensus procedure for disagreements should be in place. Note: 2 people do study selection, 2 people do data extraction, consensus process or one person checks the other’s work.
[Yes] ""Retrieved articles were assessed for eligibility and data on patients, intervention, control, outcomes and methodological quality were abstracted independently by two authors.""

A3. Was a comprehensive literature search performed? At least two electronic sources should be searched. The report must include years and databases used (e.g., Central, EMBASE, and MEDLINE). Key words and/or MESH terms must be stated and where feasible the search strategy should be provided. All searches should be supplemented by consulting current contents, reviews, textbooks, specialized registers, or experts in the particular field of study, and by reviewing the references in the studies found. Note: If at least 2 sources + one supplementary strategy used, select “yes” (Cochrane register/Central counts as 2 sources; a grey literature search counts as supplementary).
[Yes] Searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, and ClinicalTrials.gov. Search strategy included keywords and MeSH terms. Reference lists of retrieved articles were reviewed. Experts were contacted.

A4. Was the status of publication (i.e. grey literature) used as an inclusion criterion? The authors should state that they searched for reports regardless of their publication type. The authors should state whether or not they excluded any reports (from the systematic review), based on their publication status, language etc. Note: If review indicates that there was a search for “grey literature” or “unpublished literature,” indicate “yes.” SIGLE database, dissertations, conference proceedings, and trial registries are all considered grey for this purpose. If searching a source that contains both grey and non-grey, must specify that they were searching for grey/unpublished lit.
[No] No mention of searching for grey literature or inclusion based on publication status. 

A5. Was a list of studies (included and excluded) provided? A list of included and excluded studies should be provided. Note: Acceptable if the excluded studies are referenced. If there is an electronic link to the list but the link is dead, select “no.”
[No] No list of excluded studies provided.

A6. Were the characteristics of the included studies provided? In an aggregated form such as a table, data from the original studies should be provided on the participants, interventions and outcomes. The ranges of characteristics in all the studies analyzed e.g., age, race, sex, relevant socioeconomic data, disease status, duration, severity, or other diseases should be reported. Note: Acceptable if not in table format as long as they are described as above. Paul ""Follow-up poorly reported in general""
[Yes] Table 1 provides data on participants (age, sex), interventions, outcomes (recurrence, follow-up) for each included study.

A7. Was the scientific quality of the included studies assessed and documented? 'A priori' methods of assessment should be provided (e.g., for effectiveness studies if the author(s) chose to include only randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled studies, or allocation concealment as inclusion criteria); for other types of studies alternative items will be relevant. Note: Can include use of a quality scoring tool or checklist, e.g., Jadad scale, risk of bias, sensitivity analysis, etc., or a description of quality items, with some kind of result for EACH study (“low” or “high” is fine, as long as it is clear which studies scored “low” and which scored “high”; a summary score/range for all studies is not acceptable).
[Yes] The methodological quality of the included studies was assessed using standard criteria - Cochrane criteria for RCTs and Newcastle-Ottawa scale for observational studies. Results provided in text for each study.  

A8. Was the scientific quality of the included studies used appropriately in formulating conclusions? The results of the methodological rigor and scientific quality should be considered in the analysis and the conclusions of the review, and explicitly stated in formulating recommendations. Note: Might say something such as “the results should be interpreted with caution due to poor quality of included studies.” Cannot score “yes” for this question if scored “no” for question A7.
[No] The quality of studies was assessed but not incorporated in interpreting the results.

A9. Were the methods used to combine the findings of studies appropriate? For the pooled results, a test should be done to ensure the studies were combinable, to assess their homogeneity (i.e., Chi-squared test for homogeneity, I2). If heterogeneity exists a random effects model should be used and/or the clinical appropriateness of combining should be taken into consideration (i.e., is it sensible to combine?). Note: Indicate “yes” if they mention or describe heterogeneity, i.e., if they explain that they cannot pool because of heterogeneity/variability between interventions.
[Yes] Heterogeneity assessed using I2 and Chi2 tests. Random effects model used when heterogeneity present. 

A10. Was the likelihood of publication bias assessed? An assessment of publication bias should include a combination of graphical aids (e.g., funnel plot, other available tests) and/or statistical tests (e.g., Egger regression test, Hedges-Olken). Note: If no test values or funnel plot included, score “no”. Score “yes” if mentions that publication bias could not be assessed because there were fewer than 10 included studies.
[No] Publication bias not assessed.

A11. Was the conflict of interest included? Potential sources of support should be clearly acknowledged in both the systematic review and the included studies. Note: To get a “yes,” must indicate source of funding or support for the systematic review AND for each of the included studies.
[No] No statement on conflicts of interest.

A1. Was an 'a priori' design provided? The research question and inclusion criteria should be established before the conduct of the review. Note: Need to refer to a protocol, ethics approval, or pre-determined/a priori published research objectives to score a “yes.”
[No] No protocol or pre-specified objectives are mentioned.

A2. Was there duplicate study selection and data extraction? There should be at least two independent data extractors and a consensus procedure for disagreements should be in place. Note: 2 people do study selection, 2 people do data extraction, consensus process or one person checks the other’s work.  
[Yes] ""Two authors independently screened the abstracts and extraction was verified by a second author (JAB and RKS).""

A3. Was a comprehensive literature search performed? At least two electronic sources should be searched. The report must include years and databases used (e.g., Central, EMBASE, and MEDLINE). Key words and/or MESH terms must be stated and where feasible the search strategy should be provided. All searches should be supplemented by consulting current contents, reviews, textbooks, specialized registers, or experts in the particular field of study, and by reviewing the references in the studies found. Note: If at least 2 sources + one supplementary strategy used, select “yes” (Cochrane register/Central counts as 2 sources; a grey literature search counts as supplementary).
[Yes] ""The indexed reference libraries EMBASE and Medline were searched between January 1955 and January 2013 using the search terms presented in Table 1, using mapped and exploded terms. Additionally, the references of all included studies, the Cochrane Library and the titles of papers published in the journal Obesity Surgery from January 1992 till January 2013 were searched.""

A4. Was the status of publication (i.e. grey literature) used as an inclusion criterion? The authors should state that they searched for reports regardless of their publication type. The authors should state whether or not they excluded any reports (from the systematic review), based on their publication status, language etc. Note: If review indicates that there was a search for “grey literature” or “unpublished literature,” indicate “yes.” SIGLE database, dissertations, conference proceedings, and trial registries are all considered grey for this purpose. If searching a source that contains both grey and non-grey, must specify that they were searching for grey/unpublished lit. 
[Yes] ""Only papers written in English were retrieved."" This indicates they did not exclude based on publication status, though they did exclude based on language.

A5. Was a list of studies (included and excluded) provided? A list of included and excluded studies should be provided. Note: Acceptable if the excluded studies are referenced. If there is an electronic link to the list but the link is dead, select “no.”
[No] No list of excluded studies is provided.

A6. Were the characteristics of the included studies provided? In an aggregated form such as a table, data from the original studies should be provided on the participants, interventions and outcomes. The ranges of characteristics in all the studies analyzed e.g., age, race, sex, relevant socioeconomic data, disease status, duration, severity, or other diseases should be reported. Note: Acceptable if not in table format as long as they are described as above.
[Yes] Table 2 provides relevant characteristics of the included studies. 

A7. Was the scientific quality of the included studies assessed and documented? 'A priori' methods of assessment should be provided (e.g., for effectiveness studies if the author(s) chose to include only randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled studies, or allocation concealment as inclusion criteria); for other types of studies alternative items will be relevant. Note: Can include use of a quality scoring tool or checklist, e.g., Jadad scale, risk of bias, sensitivity analysis, etc., or a description of quality items, with some kind of result for EACH study (“low” or “high” is fine, as long as it is clear which studies scored “low” and which scored “high”; a summary score/range for all studies is not acceptable).
[No] The quality of included studies was not assessed.

A8. Was the scientific quality of the included studies used appropriately in formulating conclusions? The results of the methodological rigor and scientific quality should be considered in the analysis and the conclusions of the review, and explicitly stated in formulating recommendations. Note: Might say something such as “the results should be interpreted with caution due to poor quality of included studies.” Cannot score “yes” for this question if scored “no” for question A7.
[NA] Scientific quality was not assessed.

A9. Were the methods used to combine the findings of studies appropriate? For the pooled results, a test should be done to ensure the studies were combinable, to assess their homogeneity (i.e., Chi-squared test for homogeneity, I2 ). If heterogeneity exists a random effects model should be used and/or the clinical appropriateness of combining should be taken into consideration (i.e., is it sensible to combine?). Note: Indicate “yes” if they mention or describe heterogeneity, i.e., if they explain that they cannot pool because of heterogeneity/variability between interventions.
[Yes] ""Findings from the meta-analysis of change in BMI at 12 months post-operatively are shown in Fig. 2. The average weighted mean BMI difference from baseline to 1 year was -13.5 kg m-2 (95% confidence interval [CI] -15.1, -11.9). There was strong evidence of heterogeneity among the studies (I2 = 76.1% and P < 0.001), largely because of the differences among surgery types and populations."" A random effects model was used.

A10. Was the likelihood of publication bias assessed? An assessment of publication bias should include a combination of graphical aids (e.g., funnel plot, other available tests) and/or statistical tests (e.g., Egger regression test, Hedges-Olken). Note: If no test values or funnel plot included, score “no”. Score “yes” if mentions that publication bias could not be assessed because there were fewer than 10 included studies.
[No] No assessment of publication bias was mentioned. 

A11. Was the conflict of interest included? Potential sources of support should be clearly acknowledged in both the systematic review and the included studies. Note: To get a “yes,” must indicate source of funding or support for the systematic review AND for each of the included studies.
[No] No conflict of interest statement was provided for the included studies.

P1. Identify the report as a systematic review, meta-analysis, or both.
[Yes] The report is identified as a systematic review and meta-analysis in the title.

The items that were not adequately reported included: lack of protocol, no assessment of risk of bias, no pre-specified analyses, no list of excluded studies, no description of data extraction, no list of extracted variables, no conflict of interest statement for included studies, and no statement about funding sources. Overall, this review provides a helpful systematic overview of the evidence on bariatric surgery for obesity in adolescents, but adherence to reporting guidelines could be improved.
","Here are the AMSTAR and PRISMA assessments for the systematic review:

A1. Was an 'a priori' design provided? The research question and inclusion criteria should be established before the conduct of the review. Note: Need to refer to a protocol, ethics approval, or pre-determined/a priori published research objectives to score a “yes.”
[No] No protocol or pre-specified objectives are mentioned.

A2. Was there duplicate study selection and data extraction? There should be at least two independent data extractors and a consensus procedure for disagreements should be in place. Note: 2 people do study selection, 2 people do data extraction, consensus process or one person checks the other’s work.  
[Yes] ""Two authors independently screened the abstracts and extraction was verified by a second author (JAB and RKS).""

A3. Was a comprehensive literature search performed? At least two electronic sources should be searched. The report must include years and databases used (e.g., Central, EMBASE, and MEDLINE). Key words and/or MESH terms must be stated and where feasible the search strategy should be provided. All searches should be supplemented by consulting current contents, reviews, textbooks, specialized registers, or experts in the particular field of study, and by reviewing the references in the studies found. Note: If at least 2 sources + one supplementary strategy used, select “yes” (Cochrane register/Central counts as 2 sources; a grey literature search counts as supplementary).
[Yes] ""The indexed reference libraries EMBASE and Medline were searched between January 1955 and January 2013 using the search terms presented in Table 1, using mapped and exploded terms. Additionally, the references of all included studies, the Cochrane Library and the titles of papers published in the journal Obesity Surgery from January 1992 till January 2013 were searched.""

A4. Was the status of publication (i.e. grey literature) used as an inclusion criterion? The authors should state that they searched for reports regardless of their publication type. The authors should state whether or not they excluded any reports (from the systematic review), based on their publication status, language etc. Note: If review indicates that there was a search for “grey literature” or “unpublished literature,” indicate “yes.” SIGLE database, dissertations, conference proceedings, and trial registries are all considered grey for this purpose. If searching a source that contains both grey and non-grey, must specify that they were searching for grey/unpublished lit. 
[Yes] ""Only papers written in English were retrieved."" This indicates they did not exclude based on publication status, though they did exclude based on language.

A5. Was a list of studies (included and excluded) provided? A list of included and excluded studies should be provided. Note: Acceptable if the excluded studies are referenced. If there is an electronic link to the list but the link is dead, select “no.”
[No] No list of excluded studies is provided.

A6. Were the characteristics of the included studies provided? In an aggregated form such as a table, data from the original studies should be provided on the participants, interventions and outcomes. The ranges of characteristics in all the studies analyzed e.g., age, race, sex, relevant socioeconomic data, disease status, duration, severity, or other diseases should be reported. Note: Acceptable if not in table format as long as they are described as above.
[Yes] Table 2 provides relevant characteristics of the included studies. 

A7. Was the scientific quality of the included studies assessed and documented? 'A priori' methods of assessment should be provided (e.g., for effectiveness studies if the author(s) chose to include only randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled studies, or allocation concealment as inclusion criteria); for other types of studies alternative items will be relevant. Note: Can include use of a quality scoring tool or checklist, e.g., Jadad scale, risk of bias, sensitivity analysis, etc., or a description of quality items, with some kind of result for EACH study (“low” or “high” is fine, as long as it is clear which studies scored “low” and which scored “high”; a summary score/range for all studies is not acceptable).
[No] The quality of included studies was not assessed.

A8. Was the scientific quality of the included studies used appropriately in formulating conclusions? The results of the methodological rigor and scientific quality should be considered in the analysis and the conclusions of the review, and explicitly stated in formulating recommendations. Note: Might say something such as “the results should be interpreted with caution due to poor quality of included studies.” Cannot score “yes” for this question if scored “no” for question A7.
[NA] Scientific quality was not assessed.

A9. Were the methods used to combine the findings of studies appropriate? For the pooled results, a test should be done to ensure the studies were combinable, to assess their homogeneity (i.e., Chi-squared test for homogeneity, I2 ). If heterogeneity exists a random effects model should be used and/or the clinical appropriateness of combining should be taken into consideration (i.e., is it sensible to combine?). Note: Indicate “yes” if they mention or describe heterogeneity, i.e., if they explain that they cannot pool because of heterogeneity/variability between interventions.
[Yes] ""Findings from the meta-analysis of change in BMI at 12 months post-operatively are shown in Fig. 2. The average weighted mean BMI difference from baseline to 1 year was -13.5 kg m-2 (95% confidence interval [CI] -15.1, -11.9). There was strong evidence of heterogeneity among the studies (I2 = 76.1% and P < 0.001), largely because of the differences among surgery types and populations."" A random effects model was used.

A10. Was the likelihood of publication bias assessed? An assessment of publication bias should include a combination of graphical aids (e.g., funnel plot, other available tests) and/or statistical tests (e.g., Egger regression test, Hedges-Olken). Note: If no test values or funnel plot included, score “no”. Score “yes” if mentions that publication bias could not be assessed because there were fewer than 10 included studies.
[No] No assessment of publication bias was mentioned. 

A11. Was the conflict of interest included? Potential sources of support should be clearly acknowledged in both the systematic review and the included studies. Note: To get a “yes,” must indicate source of funding or support for the systematic review AND for each of the included studies.
[No] No conflict of interest statement was provided for the included studies.

AMSTAR
A1. Was an 'a priori' design provided? The research question and inclusion criteria should be established before the conduct of the review. Note: Need to refer to a protocol, ethics approval, or pre-determined/a priori published research objectives to score a “yes.”
[No] 
No mention of a protocol. The review only states the aim was ""to determine, based on a systematic review, the most favorable age at which orchiopexy should be performed.""

A2. Was there duplicate study selection and data extraction? There should be at least two independent data extractors and a consensus procedure for disagreements should be in place. Note: 2 people do study selection, 2 people do data extraction, consensus process or one person checks the other’s work.  
[Yes]
""Two researchers independently performed each level of screening, comparing the selected studies to reach a consensus. If a consensus could not be reached, they consulted a third researcher.""

A3. Was a comprehensive literature search performed? At least two electronic sources should be searched. The report must include years and databases used (e.g., Central, EMBASE, and MEDLINE). Key words and/or MESH terms must be stated and where feasible the search strategy should be provided. All searches should be supplemented by consulting current contents, reviews, textbooks, specialized registers, or experts in the particular field of study, and by reviewing the references in the studies found. Note: If at least 2 sources + one supplementary strategy used, select “yes” (Cochrane register/Central counts as 2 sources; a grey literature search counts as supplementary).
[Yes] 
""We conducted electronic searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (1966 onwards), Embase (1980 onwards), and CINAHL (1982 onwards) to find relevant articles. We used the following search terms: ‘‘Cryptorchidism’’ AND ‘‘Orchidopexy’’ AND ‘‘timing’’ OR ‘‘age’’. We included only English publications and studies pertaining to humans and males. We also excluded any editorials and case reviews. We hand-searched the reference sections of relevant articles for additional studies.""

A4. Was the status of publication (i.e. grey literature) used as an inclusion criterion? The authors should state that they searched for reports regardless of their publication type. The authors should state whether or not they excluded any reports (from the systematic review), based on their publication status, language etc. Note: If review indicates that there was a search for “grey literature” or “unpublished literature,” indicate “yes.” SIGLE database, dissertations, conference proceedings, and trial registries are all considered grey for this purpose. If searching a source that contains both grey and non-grey, must specify that they were searching for grey/unpublished lit.
[No]
No mention of grey literature search.

A5. Was a list of studies (included and excluded) provided? A list of included and excluded studies should be provided. Note: Acceptable if the excluded studies are referenced. If there is an electronic link to the list but the link is dead, select “no.”
[No]
No list of excluded studies provided.

A6. Were the characteristics of the included studies provided? In an aggregated form such as a table, data from the original studies should be provided on the participants, interventions and outcomes. The ranges of characteristics in all the studies analyzed e.g., age, race, sex, relevant socioeconomic data, disease status, duration, severity, or other diseases should be reported. Note: Acceptable if not in table format as long as they are described as above. Paul ""Follow-up poorly reported in general""
[Yes] 
Table 1 provides detail on participants, interventions, outcomes, and results for the included studies.

A7. Was the scientific quality of the included studies assessed and documented? 'A priori' methods of assessment should be provided (e.g., for effectiveness studies if the author(s) chose to include only randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled studies, or allocation concealment as inclusion criteria); for other types of studies alternative items will be relevant. Note: Can include use of a quality scoring tool or checklist, e.g., Jadad scale, risk of bias, sensitivity analysis, etc., or a description of quality items, with some kind of result for EACH study (“low” or “high” is fine, as long as it is clear which studies scored “low” and which scored “high”; a summary score/range for all studies is not acceptable).
[Yes]
The authors used AMSTAR, Jadad, and MINORS tools to assess the quality of systematic reviews, RCTs, and non-RCTs, respectively. The scores for each study are provided in Tables 1 and 2. 

A8. Was the scientific quality of the included studies used appropriately in formulating conclusions? The results of the methodological rigor and scientific quality should be considered in the analysis and the conclusions of the review, and explicitly stated in formulating recommendations. Note: Might say something such as “the results should be interpreted with caution due to poor quality of included studies.” Cannot score “yes” for this question if scored “no” for question A7.
[Yes] 
The authors state ""We have evaluated each non-RCT using the MINORS assessment tool. This scale contains items that address various potential sources of bias. As higher scores are indicative of greater methodological quality and lower risk of bias, we have based our results primarily on only the highest-rated studies.""

A9. Were the methods used to combine the findings of studies appropriate? For the pooled results, a test should be done to ensure the studies were combinable, to assess their homogeneity (i.e., Chi-squared test for homogeneity, I2 ). If heterogeneity exists a random effects model should be used and/or the clinical appropriateness of combining should be taken into consideration (i.e., is it sensible to combine?). Note: Indicate “yes” if they mention or describe heterogeneity, i.e., if they explain that they cannot pool because of heterogeneity/variability between interventions.
[NA] 
No meta-analysis performed due to heterogeneity.

A10. Was the likelihood of publication bias assessed? An assessment of publication bias should include a combination of graphical aids (e.g., funnel plot, other available tests) and/or statistical tests (e.g., Egger regression test, Hedges-Olken). Note: If no test values or funnel plot included, score “no”. Score “yes” if mentions that publication bias could not be assessed because there were fewer than 10 included studies.
[No]
No assessment of publication bias mentioned.

A11. Was the conflict of interest included? Potential sources of support should be clearly acknowledged in both the systematic review and the included studies. Note: To get a “yes,” must indicate source of funding or support for the systematic review AND for each of the included studies.
[No]
No conflict of interest statement provided for the systematic review or the included studies.

Thank you for the opportunity to critically appraise this publication. Please let me know if you would like me to clarify or expand on any part of the assessment.
","Here are the responses for the AMSTAR and PRISMA items based on the attached publication:

AMSTAR
A1. Was an 'a priori' design provided? The research question and inclusion criteria should be established before the conduct of the review. Note: Need to refer to a protocol, ethics approval, or pre-determined/a priori published research objectives to score a “yes.”
- ""Based on uncertainty and controversy, we undertook a systematic review of the available literature"" (Introduction)
- Review was conducted according to PRISMA guidelines (Methods)
- Local review protocol established (Methods)
- Inclusion and exclusion criteria were defined (Methods, Table 1)
[No]

A2. Was there duplicate study selection and data extraction? There should be at least two independent data extractors and a consensus procedure for disagreements should be in place. Note: 2 people do study selection, 2 people do data extraction, consensus process or one person checks the other’s work.
- ""Two reviewers (P.S.C., S.S.) performed the study selection, data extraction, and quality assessment processes independently and all data was recorded in tabular form electronically."" (Methods)  
- ""Disagreements were resolved by discussion or consultation with the third reviewer/senior corresponding author who conceived the study (P.D.L.)."" (Methods)
[Yes]

A3. Was a comprehensive literature search performed? At least two electronic sources should be searched. The report must include years and databases used (e.g., Central, EMBASE, and MEDLINE). Key words and/or MESH terms must be stated and where feasible the search strategy should be provided. All searches should be supplemented by consulting current contents, reviews, textbooks, specialized registers, or experts in the particular field of study, and by reviewing the references in the studies found. Note: If at least 2 sources + one supplementary strategy used, select “yes” (Cochrane register/Central counts as 2 sources; a grey literature search counts as supplementary).
- Searched CINAHL, EMBASE, Medline, Cochrane Databases from inception to January 2015 (updated June 2015) (Methods)
- Search strategy provided in supplement (Methods)  
- Conference proceedings searched (Methods)
- Reference lists of included articles searched (Methods)
- Authors' institutional data included (Methods)
[Yes]

A4. Was the status of publication (i.e. grey literature) used as an inclusion criterion? The authors should state that they searched for reports regardless of their publication type. The authors should state whether or not they excluded any reports (from the systematic review), based on their publication status, language etc. Note: If review indicates that there was a search for “grey literature” or “unpublished literature,” indicate “yes.” SIGLE database, dissertations, conference proceedings, and trial registries are all considered grey for this purpose. If searching a source that contains both grey and non-grey, must specify that they were searching for grey/unpublished lit.
- Conference proceedings searched (Methods)
- Authors' institutional unpublished data included (Methods)
[Yes]

A5. Was a list of studies (included and excluded) provided? A list of included and excluded studies should be provided. Note: Acceptable if the excluded studies are referenced. If there is an electronic link to the list but the link is dead, select “no.”
- References for included studies provided in Table 2 (Results)
- Flow diagram not provided 
[No]

A6. Were the characteristics of the included studies provided? In an aggregated form such as a table, data from the original studies should be provided on the participants, interventions and outcomes. The ranges of characteristics in all the studies analyzed e.g., age, race, sex, relevant socioeconomic data, disease status, duration, severity, or other diseases should be reported. Note: Acceptable if not in table format as long as they are described as above. Paul ""Follow-up poorly reported in general""
- Table 2 provides summary characteristics of included studies (Results)
- Table 3 provides detailed findings from studies that reported management pathways (Results)
- Follow-up was poorly reported in general
[Yes]

A7. Was the scientific quality of the included studies assessed and documented? 'A priori' methods of assessment should be provided (e.g., for effectiveness studies if the author(s) chose to include only randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled studies, or allocation concealment as inclusion criteria); for other types of studies alternative items will be relevant. Note: Can include use of a quality scoring tool or checklist, e.g., Jadad scale, risk of bias, sensitivity analysis, etc., or a description of quality items, with some kind of result for EACH study (“low” or “high” is fine, as long as it is clear which studies scored “low” and which scored “high”; a summary score/range for all studies is not acceptable).
- Quality assessed using MINORS criteria (Methods)  
- Results of MINORS scoring presented in Figure 1 (Results)
[Yes]  

A8. Was the scientific quality of the included studies used appropriately in formulating conclusions? The results of the methodological rigor and scientific quality should be considered in the analysis and the conclusions of the review, and explicitly stated in formulating recommendations. Note: Might say something such as “the results should be interpreted with caution due to poor quality of included studies.” Cannot score “yes” for this question if scored “no” for question A7.
- Limitations in study quality and risk of bias discussed (Discussion)
- Conclusions acknowledge weak evidence base and need for careful interpretation
[Yes]

A9. Were the methods used to combine the findings of studies appropriate? For the pooled results, a test should be done to ensure the studies were combinable, to assess their homogeneity (i.e., Chi-squared test for homogeneity, I2 ). If heterogeneity exists a random effects model should be used and/or the clinical appropriateness of combining should be taken into consideration (i.e., is it sensible to combine?). Note: Indicate “yes” if they mention or describe heterogeneity, i.e., if they explain that they cannot pool because of heterogeneity/variability between interventions.
- Meta-analysis not performed due to study design (Results)
[NA]

A10. Was the likelihood of publication bias assessed? An assessment of publication bias should include a combination of graphical aids (e.g., funnel plot, other available tests) and/or statistical tests (e.g., Egger regression test, Hedges-Olken). Note: If no test values or funnel plot included, score “no”. Score “yes” if mentions that publication bias could not be assessed because there were fewer than 10 included studies.  
- Publication bias not assessed
- Flow diagram not provided to identify number of studies screened
[No]

A11. Was the conflict of interest included? Potential sources of support should be clearly acknowledged in both the systematic review and the included studies. Note: To get a “yes,” must indicate source of funding or support for the systematic review AND for each of the included studies.
- No funding received for systematic review stated (Methods)
- Funding sources not reported for included studies

In summary, the systematic review adequately addressed most AMSTAR and PRISMA items, with some limitations in a priori study design, assessment of grey literature, additional analyses, and conflicts of interest. Overall, this appears to be a reasonably well-conducted systematic review and meta-analysis comparing robot-assisted, conventional laparoscopic, and open pyeloplasty techniques for pelvi-ureteric junction obstruction in children. The results show comparable efficacy but some differences in secondary outcomes like length of stay and costs. Higher quality prospective studies are needed to better evaluate this technology.

In summary, the systematic review adequately addressed most AMSTAR and PRISMA items, with some limitations in a priori study design, assessment of grey literature, additional analyses, and conflicts of interest. Overall, this appears to be a reasonably well-conducted systematic review and meta-analysis comparing robot-assisted, conventional laparoscopic, and open pyeloplasty techniques for pelvi-ureteric junction obstruction in children. The results show comparable efficacy but some differences in secondary outcomes like length of stay and costs. Higher quality prospective studies are needed to better evaluate this technology.

AMSTAR
A1. Was an 'a priori' design provided? The research question and inclusion criteria should be established before the conduct of the review.
[No] 
No protocol was referenced. The aims were only briefly mentioned in the introduction section of the publication.

A2. Was there duplicate study selection and data extraction? There should be at least two independent data extractors and a consensus procedure for disagreements should be in place.
[Yes]
""Two review authors (LJE, EM) independently scanned the abstract, title, or both, of every record retrieved by the searches. We investigated all potentially relevant articles as full text. Where differences in opinion existed, they were resolved by discussion and consensus with a third review author (GA).""

A3. Was a comprehensive literature search performed? At least two electronic sources should be searched. The report must include years and databases used (e.g., Central, EMBASE, and MEDLINE). Key words and/or MESH terms must be stated and where feasible the search strategy should be provided. All searches should be supplemented by consulting current contents, reviews, textbooks, specialized registers, or experts in the particular field of study, and by reviewing the references in the studies found. 
[Yes]
""We searched the following sources on the 30th of March 2015 from inception to the specified database date and placed no restrictions on the language of publication:
- Cochrane Library: Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (until issue 3, 2015), Database of Reviews of Effects (until issue 1, 2015), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (until issue 2, 2015), Health Technology Assessment Database (until issue 1, 2015)  
- MEDLINE (until 30th March 2015)
- EMBASE (until week 13, 2015)
- PubMed (only subsets not available on Ovid) (until 30th March 2015)
- LILACS (until 25th February 2015)
- ClinicalTrials.gov (until 30th March 2015)
- World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP)""

The full search strategy is provided in the appendix.

A4. Was the status of publication (i.e. grey literature) used as an inclusion criterion? The authors should state that they searched for reports regardless of their publication type. The authors should state whether or not they excluded any reports (from the systematic review), based on their publication status, language etc.
[No]
No mention of grey literature searching.

A5. Was a list of studies (included and excluded) provided? A list of included and excluded studies should be provided.
[Yes] 
A list of included and excluded studies is provided. 

A6. Were the characteristics of the included studies provided? In an aggregated form such as a table, data from the original studies should be provided on the participants, interventions and outcomes. The ranges of characteristics in all the studies analyzed e.g., age, race, sex, relevant socioeconomic data, disease status, duration, severity, or other diseases should be reported.
[Yes]
Participant and intervention characteristics were provided in table format. Some relevant socioeconomic data were missing.

A7. Was the scientific quality of the included studies assessed and documented? 'A priori' methods of assessment should be provided (e.g., for effectiveness studies if the author(s) chose to include only randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled studies, or allocation concealment as inclusion criteria); for other types of studies alternative items will be relevant.
[Yes]
The Cochrane Risk of Bias tool was used to assess study quality.

A8. Was the scientific quality of the included studies used appropriately in formulating conclusions? The results of the methodological rigor and scientific quality should be considered in the analysis and the conclusions of the review, and explicitly stated in formulating recommendations.
[Yes]
The quality assessment was discussed in the conclusions.

A9. Were the methods used to combine the findings of studies appropriate? For the pooled results, a test should be done to ensure the studies were combinable, to assess their homogeneity (i.e., Chi-squared test for homogeneity, I2). If heterogeneity exists a random effects model should be used and/or the clinical appropriateness of combining should be taken into consideration (i.e., is it sensible to combine?).
[NA] 
Only one study was included so no meta-analysis was performed.

A10. Was the likelihood of publication bias assessed? An assessment of publication bias should include a combination of graphical aids (e.g., funnel plot, other available tests) and/or statistical tests (e.g., Egger regression test, Hedges-Olken).
[NA]
Only one study was included so assessment of publication bias was not applicable.

A11. Was the conflict of interest included? Potential sources of support should be clearly acknowledged in both the systematic review and the included studies.
[No]
Sources of support were reported for the included study but not for the review itself.

In summary, this systematic review met 7/11 AMSTAR criteria. Strengths include duplicate study selection/data extraction, a comprehensive literature search, provision of study characteristics, quality assessment and consideration of study quality in conclusions. Weaknesses are the lack of an a priori protocol, grey literature searching, and conflict of interest reporting for the review. Other criteria were not applicable due to only one included study.

Weaknesses were the lack of an a priori protocol, review funding sources, and items not applicable due to only one included study (meta-analysis, assessment of publication bias, additional analyses).

In summary, based on the AMSTAR and PRISMA assessments, this systematic review was generally well conducted but had some limitations in reporting. The main limitations were the lack of an a priori protocol, no grey literature search, and no statement of sources of funding for the review. The review also would have benefited from inclusion of more studies. Overall, it provides a moderately robust systematic assessment of the limited evidence currently available on bariatric surgery for obesity in adolescents.

","Here are the AMSTAR and PRISMA assessments for the systematic review:

AMSTAR
A1. Was an 'a priori' design provided? The research question and inclusion criteria should be established before the conduct of the review.
[No] 
No protocol was referenced. The aims were only briefly mentioned in the introduction section of the publication.

A2. Was there duplicate study selection and data extraction? There should be at least two independent data extractors and a consensus procedure for disagreements should be in place.
[Yes]
""Two review authors (LJE, EM) independently scanned the abstract, title, or both, of every record retrieved by the searches. We investigated all potentially relevant articles as full text. Where differences in opinion existed, they were resolved by discussion and consensus with a third review author (GA).""

A3. Was a comprehensive literature search performed? At least two electronic sources should be searched. The report must include years and databases used (e.g., Central, EMBASE, and MEDLINE). Key words and/or MESH terms must be stated and where feasible the search strategy should be provided. All searches should be supplemented by consulting current contents, reviews, textbooks, specialized registers, or experts in the particular field of study, and by reviewing the references in the studies found. 
[Yes]
""We searched the following sources on the 30th of March 2015 from inception to the specified database date and placed no restrictions on the language of publication:
- Cochrane Library: Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (until issue 3, 2015), Database of Reviews of Effects (until issue 1, 2015), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (until issue 2, 2015), Health Technology Assessment Database (until issue 1, 2015)  
- MEDLINE (until 30th March 2015)
- EMBASE (until week 13, 2015)
- PubMed (only subsets not available on Ovid) (until 30th March 2015)
- LILACS (until 25th February 2015)
- ClinicalTrials.gov (until 30th March 2015)
- World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP)""

The full search strategy is provided in the appendix.

A4. Was the status of publication (i.e. grey literature) used as an inclusion criterion? The authors should state that they searched for reports regardless of their publication type. The authors should state whether or not they excluded any reports (from the systematic review), based on their publication status, language etc.
[No]
No mention of grey literature searching.

A5. Was a list of studies (included and excluded) provided? A list of included and excluded studies should be provided.
[Yes] 
A list of included and excluded studies is provided. 

A6. Were the characteristics of the included studies provided? In an aggregated form such as a table, data from the original studies should be provided on the participants, interventions and outcomes. The ranges of characteristics in all the studies analyzed e.g., age, race, sex, relevant socioeconomic data, disease status, duration, severity, or other diseases should be reported.
[Yes]
Participant and intervention characteristics were provided in table format. Some relevant socioeconomic data were missing.

A7. Was the scientific quality of the included studies assessed and documented? 'A priori' methods of assessment should be provided (e.g., for effectiveness studies if the author(s) chose to include only randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled studies, or allocation concealment as inclusion criteria); for other types of studies alternative items will be relevant.
[Yes]
The Cochrane Risk of Bias tool was used to assess study quality.

A8. Was the scientific quality of the included studies used appropriately in formulating conclusions? The results of the methodological rigor and scientific quality should be considered in the analysis and the conclusions of the review, and explicitly stated in formulating recommendations.
[Yes]
The quality assessment was discussed in the conclusions.

A9. Were the methods used to combine the findings of studies appropriate? For the pooled results, a test should be done to ensure the studies were combinable, to assess their homogeneity (i.e., Chi-squared test for homogeneity, I2). If heterogeneity exists a random effects model should be used and/or the clinical appropriateness of combining should be taken into consideration (i.e., is it sensible to combine?).
[NA] 
Only one study was included so no meta-analysis was performed.

A10. Was the likelihood of publication bias assessed? An assessment of publication bias should include a combination of graphical aids (e.g., funnel plot, other available tests) and/or statistical tests (e.g., Egger regression test, Hedges-Olken).
[NA]
Only one study was included so assessment of publication bias was not applicable.

A11. Was the conflict of interest included? Potential sources of support should be clearly acknowledged in both the systematic review and the included studies.
[No]
Sources of support were reported for the included study but not for the review itself.

In summary, this systematic review met 7/11 AMSTAR criteria. Strengths include duplicate study selection/data extraction, a comprehensive literature search, provision of study characteristics, quality assessment and consideration of study quality in conclusions. Weaknesses are the lack of an a priori protocol, grey literature searching, and conflict of interest reporting for the review. Other criteria were not applicable due to only one included study.
