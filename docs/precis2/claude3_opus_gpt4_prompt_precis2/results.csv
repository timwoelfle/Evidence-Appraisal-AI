""People with multiple sclerosis were screened on the General Health Questionnaire 12 and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, and those with low mood were recruited.""
""Participants: People with multiple sclerosis presenting with low mood between June 2008 and September 2009.""

The trial recruited people with multiple sclerosis who had low mood based on screening with the GHQ-12 and HADS. While these measures are sometimes used in usual care to screen for depression and anxiety, the trial specifically screened people in order to determine eligibility, which is more restrictive than a fully pragmatic approach. However, people with the condition of interest (MS with low mood) were still broadly recruited from a relevant care setting.

The obtained information were entered in a questionnaire so that the amount of increase or decrease of the patients' disability after the end of treatment in the three groups could be evaluated and compared.""

The primary analysis compared the treatment groups, implying an intent-to-treat approach was used. No mention is made of excluding patients from the analysis for reasons other than loss to follow-up. This suggests a pragmatic approach, analyzing all randomized participants according to their original treatment group. However, not enough details of the analysis methods are provided to determine if any explanatory analysis techniques were used.

2. ""EPOC showed that, after switching to fingolimod therapy for 6 months, patients had significant improvements in most self-reported outcomes when compared with those who continued to receive an iDMT, including satisfaction with treatment, fatigue severity, depression severity, physical function and mental health [13].""

The trial compares switching to fingolimod vs remaining on existing DMTs, which seems to match what would occur in usual care when patients are candidates for therapy change. No major changes to resources, expertise or organization of care are noted. The trial utilized typical physician and patient-reported outcomes.

The trial used a single follow-up timepoint at 6 months to assess the primary and secondary endpoints using several patient-reported outcome measures and one clinician-reported measure. This follow-up is more extensive than typical usual care, but the 6-month timepoint seems reasonable to assess the impact of switching DMTs. The follow-up lands in the middle of the explanatory-pragmatic continuum.

Primary outcome:
Quotes:
1. ""The primary post hoc study endpoint was the least-squares mean (LSM) change in Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire for Medication (TSQM) Global Satisfaction score from baseline to 6 months [15].""

The primary outcome of change in treatment satisfaction score is patient-centered and relevant to participants' perspectives. The TSQM is a validated patient-reported outcome measure, though it may not be used commonly in routine MS care. The outcome leans pragmatic but the use of the TSQM specifically reduces the score slightly.

Primary analysis:
Quotes:
1. ""For the primary and secondary post hoc study endpoints, individual comparisons were conducted for all outcome measures for switching to fingolimod compared with remaining on any of the four individual iDMTs.""
2. ""The differences in LSM change from baseline to 6 months between the treatment groups are reported, with the exception of CGI-I where the differences between the mean scores after 6 months of treatment are reported.""

The primary analysis appears to be a comparison of the four individual iDMTs vs fingolimod using the individual LSM changes from baseline. This suggests all randomized participants were included, consistent with an intent-to-treat approach. However, the specific handling of missing data is not described. The analysis seems largely pragmatic but without explicit confirmation that all data were included, a fully pragmatic score cannot be given.

Score: [4]","Eligibility:
Quotes:
1. ""Patients were required to have received a single iDMT (except natalizumab) continuously for at least 6 months prior to study initiation and to be candidates for therapy change.""
2. ""For patients from the USA, the treating physician determined whether the patient was a suitable candidate for therapy change.""
3. ""Patients were excluded from the study for any of the following reasons: chronic immune system disease other than MS; immunodeficiency; malignancy other than localized basal cell carcinoma within the past 5 years; a history of cardiac arrest, myocardial infarction, ischemic heart disease or coronary spasm within the past 6 months; Mobitz type II second-degree or third-degree atrioventricular block or an increased corrected QT (QTc) interval (>470 ms); having undergone a bone marrow transplant; a history of alcohol abuse within the past 5 years.""

The eligibility criteria are somewhat restrictive, excluding patients with various comorbidities and history of non-adherence. However, the decision for therapy change was ultimately up to the treating physician based on their assessment of suitability, which aligns with what would likely occur in usual care. The criteria are more pragmatic than explanatory overall.

Score: [3]

Setting:

Relevant quote: 
1. ""This was a multicentre open-label pragmatic parallel-group randomized clinical trial involving 13 hospitals and was conducted between 2014 and 2017.""

The trial was conducted across 13 hospitals, representing a fairly diverse range of settings. However, all the sites were hospitals rather than other care settings where COPD is routinely managed, like primary care clinics. So while the multicentre approach increases pragmatism, the hospital-only settings make it more explanatory than a true usual care approach.

The follow-up schedule of visits every 3 months is more frequent than typical COPD care. The visits also involved extensive data collection including 6MWT, spirometry, and HRQoL questionnaires that go beyond usual care. However, patients were advised to continue follow-up even if non-adherent, supporting an intent-to-treat approach. Overall, the follow-up is more explanatory than usual care, but with some pragmatic elements.

Primary outcome:

Relevant quote:
1. ""The primary outcome was the change in the 6-min walk distance (6MWD) between baseline (randomization visit, 0) and 12 months later.""

The 6-minute walk test measures functional exercise capacity, which is an outcome that is meaningful to COPD patients. However, it requires a standardized testing protocol and may not be routinely measured in usual COPD care. It strikes a balance between explanatory and pragmatic elements.

Relevant quotes:
1. ""Recruited patients (recruitment visit, −1) attended an initial 8-week outpatient-based intensive pulmonary rehabilitation programme conducted in a hospital rehabilitation department.""
2. ""Exclusion criteria were having a diagnosis of moderate-to-severe COPD (a Body mass index, Airflow obstruction, Dyspnoea and Exercise capacity index [BODE] index of 7–10) according to international guidelines and having been clinically stable for the previous 4 weeks (see the online supplementary material).""

The trial had fairly strict eligibility criteria, excluding patients without a confirmed moderate-to-severe COPD diagnosis based on the BODE index, and only including clinically stable patients. The initial intensive rehabilitation program was also conducted in a hospital setting, which differs from usual care for COPD patients. These factors make the eligibility criteria more explanatory than pragmatic.

Score: [2]

Recruitment:

Relevant quotes:
1. ""This was a multicentre open-label pragmatic parallel-group randomized clinical trial was conducted. Two groups were created at completion of an 8-week intensive outpatient hospital PR programme.""

The trial recruited patients from multiple centers who were completing an intensive outpatient hospital-based pulmonary rehabilitation program. While this is more pragmatic than recruiting through other means like advertisements, it still represents a more explanatory approach than recruiting directly through usual care visits.

Score: [3]

Setting:

Relevant quote: 
1. ""This was a multicentre open-label pragmatic parallel-group randomized clinical trial involving 13 hospitals and was conducted between 2014 and 2017.""

The trial was conducted across 13 hospitals, representing a fairly diverse range of settings. However, all the sites were hospitals rather than other care settings where COPD is routinely managed, like primary care clinics. So while the multicentre approach increases pragmatism, the hospital-only settings make it more explanatory than a true usual care approach.

Score: [3]

Organization:

Relevant quotes:
1. ""The hospital-based outpatient programme consisted of three training sessions a week which included 30 min of weight lifting and 30 min of leg cycle ergometry along with four educational sessions which included chest physiotherapy training (see online supplementary material).""
2. ""Patients in the IG were asked to continue at home with a similar training schedule to that completed in the hospital.""

The intervention required specialized staff to provide weight training, ergometry, and educational sessions that included chest physiotherapy training. Patients were also provided with training equipment like dumbbells and exercise bicycle to continue the program at home. This represents a significant increase in organizational resources compared to usual care for COPD.

Score: [2] 

Flexibility (delivery):

Relevant quotes:
1. ""The Intervention group (IG) patients were given appropriate training equipment and instructed to perform three weekly training sessions and send performance data through an app to a web-based platform.""
2. ""Patients in the CG received usual care, that is, they were advised to exercise regularly (at least walking for 1 hour a day) and provided with general educational material, following current clinical practice at participating sites.""

The intervention group had a strict protocol to perform three weekly training sessions and send data through an app. In contrast, the control group had more flexibility, with general advice to exercise regularly for at least 1 hour/day. The regimented IG protocol is more explanatory, while the CG approach is more pragmatic and flexible.

Score: [3]

Flexibility (adherence):

No relevant quotes identified. The manuscript does not discuss any measures to monitor or enforce patient adherence to the intervention protocol.

Score: [NA] 

Follow-up:

Relevant quotes:
1. ""At each follow-up visit, patients were advised to continue doing exercise and attending follow-up appointments even if they decided not to comply with the assigned maintenance exercises, supporting the intention-to-treat principle (see online supplementary material).""
2. ""After the randomization visit, follow-up appointments were arranged for both groups at 3, 9 and 12 months. At each follow-up visit, the general health status of the patient was assessed, medical treatment was revised and optimized, educational reinforcement was provided, 6-minute walk test (6MWT) and spirometry tests were carried out and HRQoL measures were taken.""

The follow-up schedule of visits every 3 months is more frequent than typical COPD care. The visits also involved extensive data collection including 6MWT, spirometry, and HRQoL questionnaires that go beyond usual care. However, patients were advised to continue follow-up even if non-adherent, supporting an intent-to-treat approach. Overall, the follow-up is more explanatory than usual care, but with some pragmatic elements.

Score: [3]

Primary outcome:

Relevant quote:
1. ""The primary outcome was the change in the 6-min walk distance (6MWD) between baseline (randomization visit, 0) and 12 months later.""

The 6-minute walk test measures functional exercise capacity, which is an outcome that is meaningful to COPD patients. However, it requires a standardized testing protocol and may not be routinely measured in usual COPD care. It strikes a balance between explanatory and pragmatic elements.

Score: [3]

Primary analysis:

Relevant quotes:
1. ""Analysed (n = 40) Excluded from analysis (no 12 months results) (n = 5)""
2. ""Analysed (n = 41) Excluded from analysis (no 12 months results) (n = 5)""

The primary analysis excluded a small number of patients (5 per group) due to missing 12-month data. This is a modified intent-to-treat approach that is slightly more explanatory than a full ITT using all randomized patients. However, the overall rate of exclusion was low.

Score: [4]

The trial had fairly broad eligibility criteria, including people with a range of disability levels (EDSS 1 to 6.5) who were registered at the MS clinic and living in the selected municipalities. However, the criteria did exclude those with very mild or advanced disability. The trial aimed to include people likely to receive the intervention in usual care, but had some restrictions.

Recruitment:

Relevant quotes:
1. ""Eighty persons completed baseline testing. An electronic randomization system was conducted by a web-based system developed and administered by the Unit of Applied Clinical Research, Institute of Cancer Research and Molecular Medicine, Norwegian University of Science and Technology, Trondheim, Norway""
2. ""The system was stratified by EDSS scores (1–3.5 and 4–6.5) to ensure a mix of people with high and low EDSS scores in both groups, and the participants were randomly assigned to the intervention group or the control group.""

Participants were recruited from those registered at the MS outpatient clinic in the selected municipalities. An electronic randomization system was used to assign participants to groups. This seems to align with how recruitment would occur in usual care for this population, using existing clinic registrations. No extra recruitment efforts are mentioned.

Score: [5]

Setting:

Relevant quote: ""Assessments at all time points took place at a Norwegian hospital.""

The trial was conducted at a single Norwegian hospital. While this may be the usual care setting for this intervention and population, including only a single center may somewhat limit applicability compared to a multi-center trial. However, not enough information is provided to fully judge if this single hospital setting matches the intended usual care setting.

Organization:

Relevant quotes:
1. ""Six neurological physical therapists conducted the intervention over being trained in GroupCoreDIST for 5 days. The training included practical and theoretical training. The physical therapists received a booklet with descriptions and photos of all exercises and variations, as well as the theoretical framework for the intervention.""
2. ""The physical therapists had varied experience (1–25 years) and certification (2 had both a master's degree in neurological physical therapy and were clinical specialists in neurological physical therapy, 1 was a clinical specialist in neurological physical therapy, and 3 were generalists in physical therapy).""

The intervention was delivered by 6 neurological physical therapists who received 5 days of specific training in the GroupCoreDIST approach. They had varied levels of experience and certification. This represents an increase in provider expertise and training compared to usual care. However, the physical therapists seem to be existing staff, not additional providers.

Score: [3] 

Flexibility (delivery):

Relevant quotes:
1. ""Planning the group sessions: Consider each participant's main problem and which symptoms are related to it; use the appropriate position and variations of exercises (5 variations for each of the 33 exercises, 6 exercise categories to that each participant can perform the exercises with optimal movement quality.""
2. ""Individual balance checkpoints and participants should perform balance challenges simultaneously at the beginning and end of each session, perceive and reflect on their own balance that day, and compare their own balance before and after each session. The physical therapist links a participant's balance challenges with the choice of exercises.""

The delivery of the intervention allowed the physical therapists to tailor and individualize the exercises to each participant's specific impairments and needs. There was a focus on participant-specific adjustments rather than a strict standardized protocol. This suggests high flexibility in delivery to match individual circumstances.

Score: [5]

Flexibility (adherence):

Relevant quotes:
1. ""Among the 67 persons who did not respond, 57% had EDSS scores of 0 to 3.5, 21% had EDSS scores of 4 to 7, and 22% had an unknown EDSS score.""
2. ""At the 18-week postintervention test, 1 person from the control group became ill and was lost to follow-up, and 3 other participants from the control group missed their assessments. At the 30-week postintervention test, 2 individuals from each group missed assessments.""

The trial does not mention any strategies to monitor or enforce participant adherence, such as excluding non-adherent participants. 57% of non-responders had low disability (EDSS 0-3.5), but non-response itself did not seem to be a basis for exclusion. A few participants missed assessments but were not excluded on this basis. This suggests flexibility in adherence was allowed, as would be expected in usual care.

Score: [5]

Follow-up:

Relevant quotes: 
1. ""Assessments were undertaken at baseline and at weeks 7, 18, and 30. Outcomes were measured with the Trunk Impairment Scale–Norwegian Version, Mini Balance Evaluation Systems Test, and Patient Global Impression of Change–Balance.""
2. ""Two assessors masked with regard to group allocation carried out the assessments. The assessors had received training in the standardized test procedures, and each was trained to apply uniform scoring criteria to all the participants and to perform scoring equivalently to the other assessor.""

Assessments were conducted at baseline, end of intervention (7 weeks), and at 18 and 30 weeks post-intervention. This exceeds what would be typical in usual care. The assessors were masked and specifically trained in standardized procedures. Overall, the follow-up was more intense than usual care, but not excessively so.

Score: [3]

Primary outcome:

Relevant quotes:
1. ""The TIS-NV measures dynamic sitting balance and trunk control and includes 6 test items scored from 0 to 2 or 3, with a total score from 0 to 16 (0 = severe problem).""
2. ""The TIS-NV is a modified version of the original Trunk Impairment Scale, which has been validated and tested for reliability in people with MS.30 The Mini-BESTest measures dynamic balance and includes 14 test items scored from 0 to 2, with a total score from 0 to 28.""

The primary outcome measures (TIS-NV and Mini-BESTest) assess dynamic sitting balance, trunk control and overall balance. These outcomes are likely to be important and relevant to people with MS. The measures have been validated in MS populations. However, the use of these specific scales and the scoring criteria may not exactly match what is typical in usual care.

Score: [4]

Primary analysis:

Relevant quotes:
1. ""One individual missed all postintervention tests, leaving 79 participants in the intention-to-treat analysis.""
2. ""Analyzed at all time-points (n = 39)
• Excluded from analysis due to no posttest (n = 1)""

The primary analysis was conducted as an intention-to-treat analysis, including all participants except one individual who missed all post-intervention tests. This is a pragmatic approach that includes nearly all participants in the analysis regardless of adherence. Excluding one participant with no outcome data is reasonable and unlikely to significantly impact the results.

The primary outcome measures (TIS-NV and Mini-BESTest) assess dynamic sitting balance, trunk control and overall balance. These outcomes are likely to be important and relevant to people with MS. The measures have been validated in MS populations. However, the use of these specific scales and the scoring criteria may not exactly match what is typical in usual care.

2. ""Analyzed at all time-points (n = 39)

The primary analysis was conducted as an intention-to-treat analysis, including all participants except one individual who missed all post-intervention tests. This is a pragmatic approach that includes nearly all participants in the analysis regardless of adherence. Excluding one participant with no outcome data is reasonable and unlikely to significantly impact the results.

1. ""Objective: The objective of this study was to assess the effects of a practically implemented exercise programme on self-directed exercise behaviour and important health outcomes in PwMS to nine months of follow-up.""
2. ""Primary outcome was self-reported exercise behaviour at three months using the Godin Leisure Time Exercise Questionnaire (GLTEQ).""

The primary outcome of self-reported exercise behavior at 3 months using the GLTEQ is relevant to participants, as increasing self-directed exercise is a patient-centered goal. However, using a self-report questionnaire is less direct than measuring actual exercise behavior. The 3-month time point is also a relatively short-term outcome.

Relevant quotes:
1. ""Participants who were lost to follow-up at three months were treated as non-exercisers and included in the analysis.""

The primary analysis took a pragmatic approach by including all participants lost to follow-up at 3 months, treating them as non-exercisers rather than excluding them. This is similar to an intention-to-treat approach. No other details are provided on the analysis methods.

All patients were assessed by a consultant neurologist with an interest in MS prior to entering the trial. The inclusion criteria for the trial were clinical diagnosis of MS, as defined by the modified McDonald criteria, with an Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score of 1.0–6.5, and able to walk a 10-metre distance; aged 18–65 years; clinically stable for at least four weeks prior to entering the study; physically able to participate in exercise three times per week; able to provide written informed consent.""

The trial recruited participants from MS clinics and community advertisements, assessing them based on standard clinical criteria like MS diagnosis, EDSS score, age, clinical stability, physical ability to exercise, and ability to provide consent. While these criteria would be used in usual care, the EDSS score range of 1.0-6.5 and age range of 18-65 are narrower than the full spectrum of MS patients likely to be treated in usual care. The physical ability and consent requirements may also exclude some patients compared to usual care.

Recruitment:

Relevant quotes:
1. ""A total of 120 PwMS were recruited via the Sheffield MS Clinic and flyers/community adverts displayed at the local South Yorkshire MS Society branches.""

Participants were recruited from a single MS clinic and through community advertisements and patient society branches in one region. While recruiting from an MS clinic is pragmatic, using flyers and community advertisements is an extra recruitment effort that goes beyond what would occur in usual care. Limiting to one region also reduces generalizability compared to recruiting from multiple centers.

Setting:

Relevant quotes:
1. ""Participants on disease-modifying therapy (interferon beta, glatiramer acetate and natalizumab) had been stable on this treatment for at least three months.""
2. ""Participants were encouraged to exercise in community-based settings.""

The trial was conducted in community-based settings, which matches where most MS patients would receive an exercise intervention in usual care. However, participants were recruited from a single MS clinic, so the setting is not as broad as all the centers that would treat MS patients in usual care. Participants were also required to be on stable disease-modifying therapy, which may differ from the full spectrum treated in usual practice.

During weeks 1–6, participants attended two supervised sessions per week at a university exercise research facility and engaged in one additional self-directed exercise session in their home or local community.""

The intervention was delivered by an exercise physiologist with some physiotherapist input, which is likely a higher level of expertise than would be consistently available in usual care. The sessions were held in a university research facility, which differs from typical community settings. Participants did complete some self-directed sessions at home or in the community, but the overall organization of the intervention included extra resources.

Flexibility (delivery):

Relevant quotes:
1. ""Supervised exercise sessions involved up to three participants and lasted for approximately one hour. Studies show that aerobic exercise, resistance exercise and combined programmes bring health benefits to PwMS. Hence, the programme was designed to be pragmatic and accessible, taking into account exercise preferences and giving choices.""
2. ""Aerobic exercise was the core component and was accessible (i.e. includes community-based walking exercise) and does not require equipment.""

The intervention involved supervised group sessions of aerobic exercise, resistance training, and combined training, allowing some choice of exercise type based on patient preference. The aerobic component was designed to be accessible in community settings without equipment. This represents a moderately flexible approach that is mostly pragmatic but somewhat more structured than usual care.

Home exercise during the intervention period comprised walking.""

Adherence to the intervention was encouraged but very good adherence was not required. Participants attended an average of 90% of supervised sessions and 81% of home sessions, with wide ranges, suggesting that perfect adherence was not mandated. No adherence-based exclusions were reported. This represents a pragmatic approach, applying no more than usual encouragement for adherence.

The primary aim was to evaluate effects on walking, which is an outcome that matters to patients. Walking endurance was measured with the 2-minute walk test, which is a standardized and objective test, but it may not be routinely used in usual care. The other walking outcomes like walking speed were measured using more explanatory methods like the GAITRite electronic walkway.

The primary analysis was intention-to-treat including all randomized participants. Missing data was handled with last observation carried forward, which is a simple but potentially biased approach. The article does not mention any additional explanatory analyses that excluded participants based on adherence or protocol deviations.

The trial recruited participants through an MS support organization and specialist clinic, and had relatively broad inclusion criteria requiring only a diagnosis of relapsing-remitting MS, mild to moderate disability based on a standard scale, and medical clearance. This suggests the participants were fairly representative of the real-world population with relapsing-remitting MS and some walking impairment. However, the Ambulation Index score cutoff of 2-4 would exclude those with very mild or more severe walking disability who may still be treated in usual care.

The intervention was delivered in typical community gyms in both metropolitan and regional areas, by exercise trainers, without mentioning additional resources or expertise beyond what would be available in usual care. The exercises targeted key muscle groups for walking using standard equipment described in Table 1. This suggests the organization of intervention delivery matched closely with what would be available in usual care.

The weight lifted was increased when two sets of 12 repetitions of an exercise could be completed.""

The intervention used a highly specified protocol, with specific exercises, weight machines, numbers of repetitions and sets, and a defined method for progressing the intensity based on number of repetitions completed.

Primary outcome:

Relevant quotes:
1. ""The primary clinical outcome was motor function measured by the Amended Motor Club Assessment (AMCA) score at week 36, analysed in the modified intention-to-treat population (excluding only patients who were deemed ineligible after randomisation, those who withdrew from the trial and were unwilling for their previously collected data to be used, or those who did not provide baseline and week 36 measurements).""

The primary outcome of motor function using the AMCA score appears to be a clinically meaningful and relevant measure for progressive multiple sclerosis. However, it is unlikely this specific scale would always be used in routine clinical practice outside of a trial setting. On balance, the primary outcome leans pragmatic but with some explanatory characteristics.

Primary analysis:

Relevant quotes:
1. ""The primary analysis was defined as a 9-point between-group difference in AMCA score at week 36 in the modified intention-to-treat population and analysed in a regression-based analysis (ANCOVA approach).""
2. ""The analyses were pre-specified in a statistical analysis plan approved by the trial steering committee before analysis started, except for the analysis method for spasm frequency, which was adjusted for the stratification factors (region and baseline EDSS) as fixed effects and baseline scores where appropriate (ie, fully adjusted models); results adjusted for baseline scores alone are also presented.""

The primary analysis used a modified intention-to-treat approach, excluding only those deemed ineligible after randomization, those who completely withdrew, or those missing both baseline and 36-week data. This is a fairly pragmatic approach, although not as pragmatic as a full intention-to-treat with all randomized participants. Some secondary analyses adjusted for baseline scores alone, which is also more pragmatic. Overall, the analysis approach leans more pragmatic than explanatory.

Relevant quotes:
1. ""Participants were recruited through eight health-care organisations, including the UK National Health Service (NHS) Trusts, social enterprises, and third sector multiple sclerosis therapy centres, in two regions (Devon–Cornwall and East Anglia) of the UK.""
2. ""Key inclusion criteria were age older than 18 years, a diagnosis of progressive multiple sclerosis according to McDonald's criteria, and a score of 6·5–8·0 on the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS). Key exclusion criteria were being within 3 months of ceasing a multiple sclerosis disease-modifying drug, receiving steroid treatment within the preceding 3 months, or participating in another clinical trial.""

The trial recruited from a range of healthcare organizations that would normally treat people with progressive multiple sclerosis, suggesting a pragmatic approach. However, the inclusion and exclusion criteria were more restrictive than what would be expected in usual care, such as excluding those who recently stopped disease-modifying drugs or received steroid treatment. This shifts the trial somewhat towards the explanatory end of the spectrum.

2. ""Nevertheless, further research is needed to disentangle the intrinsic effects of standing frame use from, for example, attention.""

The delivery of the intervention does not appear to have been highly flexible, as a specific standing frame program was evaluated. However, the usual care group was not given any intervention, which is consistent with what would occur outside a trial. The authors acknowledge that some effects could be due to placebo or attention rather than the intrinsic effects of the standing frame, suggesting the intervention had some degree of flexibility. Overall, the delivery appears to be a balance between explanatory and pragmatic.

The trial had broad eligibility criteria, enrolling 150 patients who were randomly assigned to the intervention or usual care. There is no mention of excluding patients based on adherence or using tests not available in usual care to determine eligibility. This suggests a pragmatic approach to eligibility.

Recruitment:
Quotes:
""Patients completed written informed consent.""
""Eligible patients completed all preintervention assessments before randomization. Randomization was conducted by the principal investigator who had no prior contact with patients and was fully blinded to all patient information, except study identification number of patients.""

Patients were recruited after being referred to the hospital and provided written informed consent. The principal investigator conducting randomization was blinded to patient information. No additional recruitment efforts beyond usual care are mentioned. This represents a fairly pragmatic recruitment approach.

""Neurologists verified all patients for the following inclusion criteria: 1) diagnosis of relapsing-remitting (but no more than 2 exacerbations within the last year) or secondary progressive MS""

The trial was conducted at a single center over a 2 year period. Patients had to meet specific diagnostic criteria verified by neurologists to be included. While conducted in a real-world clinical setting, the single-center nature and diagnostic verification make the setting somewhat more explanatory than usual care.

""MBI is based upon concepts of mental training that propose that nonjudgmental awareness moment-to-moment experience (i.e., mindfulness) may positively affect accuracy of perception, acceptance of unchangeable health-related changes, realistic sense of control, and appreciation of available life experiences.""
""MBI closely followed the program of mindfulness-based stress reduction and included 1) a personal intake interview to define realistic goals of participants and establish personal rapport; 2) 8 weekly 2.5-hour classes (10–15 participants/group; exercises did not exceed patients' level of functioning); 3) one Saturday, 7-hour session at week 6; 4) homework assignments (approximately 40 minutes/day); emphasized as essential to success of the program; 5) a postintervention interview to evaluate personal experiences, goal attainment, and future maintenance of acquired skills.""

The mindfulness-based intervention involved specialized training and organization of care, including intake interviews, 8 weekly 2.5-hour classes, a full-day session, and extensive homework. This represents a substantial change from usual care organization and required additional expertise and resources to deliver the intervention.

Primary outcome:

Relevant quote:
1. ""The primary study outcome was the change in control self-efficacy, assessed by the Multiple Sclerosis Self-Efficacy Scale (MSSES), at six months [12]. The MSSES is a specific and sensitive self-report questionnaire consisting of two 9-items subscales for control and functional self-efficacy, with a high internal consistency and test-retest reliability [12].""

The primary outcome was a patient-reported measure of self-efficacy using the Multiple Sclerosis Self-Efficacy Scale (MSSES). This appears to be a relevant outcome from the patient perspective, providing insight into their perceived level of control and functional ability. As a self-report questionnaire, it does not require specialized training or assessment not found in typical care. However, the MSSES seems to be a research tool and it is unclear if it is used regularly in routine MS care.

Primary analysis:

Relevant quotes: 
1. ""All endpoints were analyzed according to the intention-to-treat principle using an ANCOVA with the 6-month value as dependent variable, and condition, baseline value, disease duration and gender as independent variables.""
2. ""Post hoc analyses included ANCOVA with the 1-month and 3-month values as dependent variables, and condition, baseline values, disease duration and gender as independent variables; multiple regression analysis to detect the contribution of age, gender, disease duration, EDSS score and education at six months.""

The primary analysis was conducted using an intention-to-treat approach, including all participants according to their randomized group. This matches the pragmatic approach of including all participants regardless of adherence. Some secondary analyses looked at associations with baseline characteristics like age, gender, disease duration - but these were exploratory and did not involve excluding participants. No methods to account for non-adherence or missing data are mentioned.

Score: [5]","Eligibility:

Relevant quotes:
1. ""Eligibility criteria for patients: diagnosis RRMS since at least one year, EDSS score ≤4.0, no symptoms suggestive of a relapse, no relapse in the preceding four weeks, willing and capable of participating in the investigations, and having access to the internet for performing the web-based assessments.""
2. ""Eligibility criteria for support partners: willing and capable of participating in the investigations, and having access to the internet.""

The eligibility criteria are somewhat restrictive, excluding patients with higher disability levels (EDSS > 4.0), recent relapses, or lack of internet access. Support partners also need to be willing and have internet access. However, the criteria do not seem to deviate drastically from the typical MS patient population that would be treated with this intervention in usual care. The focus on low-disability RRMS patients capable of using web-based assessments makes the eligibility criteria lean more towards the explanatory end of the spectrum.

Recruitment:

Relevant quotes:
1. ""Participants were recruited from all over the Netherlands by the patient organisation NMSF, Rotterdam, the Netherlands. Interested patients were contacted by a registered nurse experienced in MS (MH) by phone to check diagnosis and eligibility criteria.""

The trial recruited participants from all over the Netherlands through the patient organization NMSF. This broad geographic recruitment strategy is pragmatic. However, the fact that a registered MS nurse had to contact each patient by phone to verify eligibility and diagnosis makes the recruitment process more intensive than what would typically occur in usual care. There is no mention of recruitment taking place during routine clinical encounters.

Score: [3]

Setting:

Relevant quotes:
1. ""We did a single-centre, randomized (1:1), unmasked, parallel-group, controlled trial in the Netherlands.""

The trial was conducted at a single center in the Netherlands. While this could match the setting of usual care if the intervention is intended to be delivered in a similar single-center context, in most cases a multi-center trial would provide a more pragmatic representation of the range of usual care settings in which the intervention would be implemented. Without more details, it seems this was likely a specialized MS research center rather than a typical community care setting.

Organization:

Relevant quotes:
1. ""The multidisciplinary team included a psychiatrist, psychiatric nurse, neurologist, registered nurse specialized in MS, physiotherapist, dance therapist, and a person with MS [9]. All professional team members were formally trained in their respective disciplines and all members were experienced in the field of MS. The person with MS had experience with chronic symptoms and multiple disease-modifying treatments.""
2. ""The members respected and understood the participants' individual qualities and differences, and they stimulated, defied and confronted them to explore and push their boundaries [9].""

The trial required a multidisciplinary team of specialists experienced in MS care to deliver the intervention. This included a psychiatrist, MS-specialized nurses, physiotherapist, dance therapist, and even a person with MS to share their experience. The team members received specific training in the social cognitive theory-based approach used in the intervention. This level of specialized expertise and training goes beyond what would typically be available in usual care to deliver this kind of intervention. The delivery relied on resources and provider expertise that are not routinely available.

Flexibility (delivery):

Relevant quotes:
1. ""CDT is a social cognitive theory-based intervention aiming to uncover and promote existing capabilities, with the notion 'stressor' as central concept [9]. CDT is based on the identification and reduction of stressors, client-centeredness, and the notion of another significant informal caregiver group session; and self-reliance, autonomy and acceptance as central themes [9].""
2. ""CDT focuses on the exploration of those stressors that confine patients to their physical, psychological or social roles regarding their disease and limitations; reduces these stressors; explores and pushes personal boundaries; and creates new personal boundaries by making optimal use of the existing potential [9].""

The delivery of the intervention appears to be guided by overarching themes and principles of the social cognitive theory-based approach, but the full text does not provide details on how strictly protocolized or monitored the delivery was. The descriptions suggest some flexibility for the multidisciplinary team to tailor the program to focus on each individual patient's specific stressors and goals. However, without more information on the degree of flexibility permitted, it is difficult to determine if the delivery flexibility matches what would be seen in usual care.

There is limited information provided about measures to ensure or monitor participant adherence. The ""optional joint activity"" suggests that participants had some flexibility in choosing whether to take part in certain intervention components. However, the lack of detail in the full text makes it difficult to assess how much adherence was enforced compared to usual care.

""The intention was to follow participants for the first year of the intervention when the exercise programme was designed and adjusted as needed and have a further follow-up after the second year.""
""As there were substantial losses to follow-up, only results after one year are presented.""

The plan was to follow participants for 2 years, with the primary analysis at 1 year. This is longer than typical follow-up in usual care for an exercise intervention. However, high loss to follow-up meant only 1-year data could be analyzed.

""Full details on the measures are presented in the protocol publication.9 The primary outcome was exercise capacity as measured by peak oxygen consumption (VO2peak) using a modified Bruce protocol on the cycle ergometer.""

The primary outcome of VO2peak, while clinically relevant, requires a specialized exercise test not typically done in usual care. Secondary outcomes of physical function, fatigue and quality of life are more pragmatic.

Score: [3]

Primary analysis:

Relevant quotes:
""As the outcomes were continuous, linear regression was used with study status (missing baseline, drop-out before end, or completer) as the explanatory variable, with baseline only serving as the reference category.""
""Multiple imputation was used for missing data with 11 imputations used in the analysis. The primary analysis was of the proportion of people making an absolute improvement at the final time point, 12 months.""

The primary analysis used multiple imputation to handle missing data and analyzed all participants. This is a pragmatic approach in line with intention-to-treat principles. No participants appear to have been excluded based on adherence or protocol deviations.

Score: [5]

In summary, this trial took a mixed approach, with some pragmatic elements like broad recruitment, clinically relevant setting, intention-to-treat analysis; and some more explanatory elements like providing extra resources/expertise, less flexibility in delivery, and a primary outcome requiring specialized testing. Most domains were scored in the middle range between very explanatory and very pragmatic.","Here is my assessment of the PRECIS-2 scores for each domain based on the provided full text:

Eligibility:

Relevant quotes:
""Specific inclusion criteria were (1) ambulatory (can walk 100 m, be capable of walking 100 metres without a walking aid corresponding to a classification of ⩽5.5 on the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS),10 even if they do use an aid for daily activities; and (2) self-reported to be sedentary or irregularly active at time of study entry (i.e. do not exercise 30 minutes or more twice per week of moderate to vigorous activity).""
""Excluded were people who were (1) unable to speak and read English or French; (2) unable to respond to simple questions on orientation and memory; (3) have an additional illness that restricts their function; and/or (4) experienced a relapse during the past 30 days as this may affect physical activity/exercise participation.""

The trial had fairly specific eligibility criteria, excluding those unable to walk 100m, those not sedentary/irregularly active, non-English/French speakers, those with orientation/memory issues or illness restricting function, and recent relapse. This is more restrictive than a very pragmatic trial but not as narrow as a very explanatory trial.

Recruitment:

Relevant quotes:
""The target population was community dwelling individuals aged 19 to 65 who have been diagnosed after 1994 with multiple sclerosis.""
""People were recruited from four multiple sclerosis clinics in three Canadian cities and from posting on media sites.""

Participants were recruited from both MS clinics and media sites/postings. Using only MS clinics would be more pragmatic, while the media postings make the recruitment approach somewhat less pragmatic.

Score: [4] 

Setting:

Relevant quote:
""People were identified multiple sclerosis clinics in Montreal, Toronto, Winnipeg.""

The trial was conducted in 3 cities in Canada. While not as pragmatic as a large number of diverse sites, using 3 cities across the country is still reasonably pragmatic and matches the intended setting of the intervention.

Organization:
Quotes: ""Patients in the community were excluded.""
Reasoning: By excluding patients in the community and focusing on a hospital-based outpatient clinic, the trial utilizes resources and expertise that may exceed what is typically available in usual care for MS patients across all settings. However, the article does not describe utilizing any additional training or resources beyond what would be expected in this specific hospital clinic.

Follow-up:
Quotes: ""At the end of the inclusion visit (conducted by the evaluating neurologist participating in the multidisciplinary team), the patient was randomized via a central Web-based randomization system. Treatment was allocated according to a computer-generated randomization list in a 1:1 ratio. Patients were then randomized in two groups depending on the treatment strategy: (i) an integrated multidisciplinary (IMD) group, consisting of an IMD approach at the Pitié-Salpêtrière MS clinic, and (ii) a control group, consisting of successive, non-integrated interventions with different specialists and allied health professionals, at different times and sites (Figure 1). For patients in the IMD group, the multidisciplinary integrated outpatient clinic was planned at our MS clinic within a maximum three-month period after inclusion.""
Reasoning: Follow-up in the IMD group involved a multidisciplinary clinic visit within 3 months, which may be more frequent than typical follow-up in usual care. The control group received usual non-integrated care. Overall, the follow-up is moderately pragmatic but the short-term follow-up of the IMD group is likely more than would occur in usual care.

Primary outcome:
Quotes: ""The primary outcome was the change in QoL from inclusion to M6, assessed by the Multiple Sclerosis Impact Scale (MSIS-29) self-questionnaire.

A higher MSIS-29 score corresponds to lower QoL. The questionnaire takes 25 minutes to complete.""
Reasoning: The primary outcome of change in quality of life, as measured by the MS-specific MSIS-29 scale, is highly relevant and meaningful to patients. The MSIS-29 is a validated scale that could be feasibly implemented in usual care, though the 25 minutes required for completion is longer than some QoL measures. Overall, the primary outcome choice is quite pragmatic.

The standard deviation for the change in the MSIS-29 was 14 points. With the same hypotheses, 22 patients per group were necessary to provide the study a power of 90% with a type 1 error rate of 0.05.

Reasoning: The primary analysis appears to be a standard hypothesis test comparing the change in MSIS-29 scores between the two randomized groups. While not explicitly stated, this is likely an intention-to-treat analysis including all randomized patients. No mention is made of excluding patients from the analysis. The sample size calculation is based on detecting a between-group difference, not testing the intervention in an ""as treated"" fashion.

The primary outcome of walking speed, measured by a 5-minute self-selected walk test, appears to be a pragmatic and directly relevant outcome from the patient perspective. It is an outcome that matters to patients and would likely be used to assess mobility in regular practice. No central adjudication or non-standard assessment appears to have been used. The 5-minute walk test seems to be a reasonably pragmatic approach, though it's unclear if it fully replicates walking assessment under usual care conditions.

1. ""A Restricted Maximum Likelihood approach to fitting mixed models was employed to allow intention to treat assumptions to cope with missing data. All analysis was performed on IBM SPSS v24, using a 5% level of significance (IBM, New York, USA).""

The trial used a restricted maximum likelihood mixed model approach to allow for an intention-to-treat analysis that copes with missing data. This suggests a pragmatic approach of using all available data in the primary analysis, rather than a more explanatory per-protocol or as-treated analysis. The use of mixed models to handle missing data is a reasonable approach that preserves an intention-to-treat framework.

2. ""Participants were screened for eligibility, and written informed consent was gained prior to randomization.""

The trial had fairly pragmatic eligibility criteria, including treatment-naïve Multiple Sclerosis patients with persistent foot drop for over 3 months. However, the participants were screened for eligibility prior to randomization, which is a more explanatory approach compared to simply including anyone who would be a candidate for the intervention in usual care. The specific eligibility screening criteria are not detailed, so it's unclear how selective or pragmatic they were.

1. ""Potential participants were screened for eligibility, and written informed consent was gained prior to randomization. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive an ankle-foot orthosis or functional electrical stimulation device, by selecting the next envelope from 85 randomly ordered prefilled sealed opaque envelopes.""

Participants were recruited and screened for eligibility prior to randomization. The full text does not provide details on the recruitment methods, such as whether recruitment was done through usual clinic visits or if supplementary recruitment efforts were used. The randomization using sealed envelopes suggests the recruitment was implemented specifically for the trial rather than embedded in routine care. However, without more details on the recruitment process, an assessment of how pragmatic or explanatory it was is difficult.

Relevant quotes:
1. ""Setting: Seven Multiple Sclerosis outpatient centres across Scotland.""

The trial was conducted across seven outpatient MS clinics in Scotland. Assuming these clinics are representative of the typical setting where MS patients would receive treatment for foot drop, this represents a fairly pragmatic choice of setting. Including multiple centers increases the applicability compared to a single center trial. However, details are lacking to fully assess how well the trial clinics match the settings where the results are intended to be applied.

The trial utilized existing clinic staff (physiotherapists) to fit patients with the devices. However, the physiotherapists had specific experience with functional electrical stimulation, which may exceed what is normally available in routine care. Participants were instructed to gradually increase wear of the devices over six weeks, which is an approach that may not occur in usual care. Overall the delivery seems to rely on some trial-specific organization and resources.

2. ""Electrode position, pulse width, waveform and ramping parameters were adjusted for each participant in order to achieve a comfortable and efficient muscle contraction. The current amplitude ranged from 7 to 72 mA (mean = 40 mA).""

The trial protocol specified some details of how the intervention should be delivered, such as gradually increasing wear over six weeks and adjusting stimulation parameters for patient comfort. However, the stimulation parameters were individualized to each participant, allowing some flexibility. Overall the delivery allowed for a moderate degree of flexibility rather than being highly regimented.

Follow-up assessments were conducted at baseline, 3, 6 and 12 months, with one outcome measure only assessed at 12 months. This schedule involves more frequent follow-up than would likely occur under usual care. The assessments were administered by trial personnel. Overall this represents a more explanatory approach to follow-up than the highly pragmatic approach of solely using routine data collection.

These outcomes, especially fatigue severity and quality of life, are likely to be directly meaningful and relevant to people with MS. The fatigue self-efficacy scale appears to be a measure more specific to the intervention.

There is no indication of procedures to monitor or improve patient adherence, which implies flexibility for the patients to engage with hippotherapy as they would in usual care.
Score: [5]

Follow-up:
Quotes: ""Examinations and questionnaires were completed prior to the first hippotherapy session (baseline), after 6–7 weeks (interim assessment) and after 12 weeks (final assessment). Physiotherapists who assessed the endpoints in a separate room were blinded and explicitly trained not to question patients or hippotherapists.""
""Patients were individually instructed to keep confidentiality of their allocation group.""

Follow-up assessments were done at 6-7 weeks and 12 weeks, which is more than typical for usual care of MS. Physiotherapists were blinded to allocation. Patients were instructed not to reveal their group. These procedures are more explanatory than pragmatic.
Score: [2]  

Primary outcome:
Quotes: ""The primary endpoint was the change in the BBS (Berg Balance Scale) (0–13 (difference from BBS baseline to week 12). Secondary endpoints were changes from baseline in fatigue (Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS)),14,15 health-related quality of life (Multiple Sclerosis Quality of Life-54 (MSQoL-54)),16 pain (Visual Analogue Scale (VAS)),17,18 and spasticity (Numeric Rating Scale (NRS)).""

The primary outcome of change in Berg Balance Scale is relevant and important to MS patients. The BBS is a standard physiotherapy assessment tool. The secondary outcomes of fatigue, quality of life, pain and spasticity are also patient-centered. The outcomes strike a pragmatic tone.
Score: [4]

Primary analysis:
Quotes: ""Analyses were based on the modified intention-to-treat set (modified ITT). This set encompasses all randomized patients with valid baseline assessment. The primary endpoint change of BBS from baseline to 12 weeks was calculated using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) with the fixed effects group, center, age, gender, EDSS classification, and baseline BBS (type 2 sums of squares). Missing values were imputed through the last observation carried forward (LOCF) value.""
""Moreover, a mixed-model repeated-measures (MMRM) analysis was done using non-imputed data with the fixed effects group, center, time, group by time, age, gender, EDSS classification, and baseline BBS (type 3 sums of squares, ARH1 covariance structure on time).""

The primary analysis was a modified intention-to-treat, including all randomized patients with a baseline assessment. Missing data were imputed using last observation carried forward. A supplementary mixed-model repeated measures analysis was also done. While not as pragmatic as a full ITT using all randomized patients, the mITT approach is more pragmatic than a per-protocol or as-treated analysis.

""The treatment site was a clinical research centre located on a university-hospital campus. Enrolment ended when patients' registry in all possible clinical sites had been scanned. Data collection lasted from June 2009–March 2013.""

The intervention was delivered at a single clinical research center located on a university-hospital campus. While this is a real-world clinical setting, using a single center makes the trial less pragmatic than if it had been delivered across multiple centers. The pragmatic approach would be to deliver the intervention in the same varied settings where it would be implemented in usual care.

The control group received usual care, suggesting follow-up procedures were not more intense than usual care. Data collection occurred over an extended period from 2009-2013, but it's unclear if this involved more frequent follow-up than usual care. There is not quite enough information to determine if follow-up was different than usual care.

Primary outcome:

Relevant quote:
""The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of a partnership-based self-management programme for patients with mild and moderate COPD. The intervention was provided for 6 months with a subsequent follow-up for additional 6 months.""

The primary outcome appears to be evaluating the effectiveness of the self-management program on COPD patients, which seems like an outcome that would be meaningful to patients. Assessing effectiveness at 6 months with an additional 6 month follow-up also seems like a reasonably pragmatic timeframe. However, without more details on exactly how effectiveness was measured, it's difficult to fully assess if the outcome measures were maximally pragmatic.

While this may reflect the typical patient population with this condition, the very high proportion of white participants (99.6%) suggests recruitment was not as broadly representative as it would be in usual care.

""A pragmatic, multicenter, parallel-group, randomized clinical trial, the Proximal Fracture of the Humerus Evaluation by Randomization (PROFHER) trial, recruited 250 patients aged 16 years or older (mean age, 66 years [range, 24-92 years]; 192 [77%] were female; and 249 [99.6%] were white) who presented at the orthopedic departments of 32 acute UK National Health Service hospitals between September 2008 and April 2011 within 3 weeks after sustaining a displaced fracture of the proximal humerus involving the surgical neck.""

The trial was conducted at orthopedic departments across 32 UK National Health Service hospitals, representing the typical setting where patients with this fracture would be treated. This supports a pragmatic approach.

Score: [4]

Organization:
Quotes:
""Standardized outpatient and community-based rehabilitation was provided to both groups.""
""Physiotherapists (median of 4 sessions for each physiotherapist; IQR, 2-8 sessions) provided conservative treatment to both groups.""

The trial provided standardized rehabilitation to both surgical and nonsurgical groups, delivered by physiotherapists. This matches how care would typically be organized for these patients in usual practice.

Score: [4]

Flexibility (delivery):
Quotes:
""Surgeons experienced in these techniques performed the surgical procedures.""
""Surgeons (median of 1 patient per surgeon; IQR, 1-3 patients) performed the surgical procedures.""

The trial allowed flexibility in the surgical procedures, which were performed by experienced surgeons according to their usual techniques. Each surgeon treated a median of only 1 patient. This suggests delivery of the intervention had similar flexibility to usual care.

""The data for 231 patients (114 in surgical group and 117 in nonsurgical group) were included in the primary analysis.""

The trial followed up patients at 2 years, which is a longer duration than typical for evaluating a fracture treatment. However, the follow-up did not seem to involve additional visits or data collection beyond what would be done in usual care. 215 of 250 patients (86%) had complete 2-year data.

""The primary outcome was the Oxford Shoulder Score (OSS), which is a shoulder-specific outcome measure validated in a UK population.""
""The OSS provides a total score based on the patient's subjective assessment of pain and function. It contains 12 items, each with 5 categories of response, and a range of total scores of 0 (worst outcome) to 48 (best outcome).""

The Oxford Shoulder Score is a patient-reported outcome measure specific to shoulder function and validated in the UK population. It assesses domains relevant to patients such as pain and function using a simple questionnaire. This supports a pragmatic approach to the primary outcome.

Primary analysis:
Quotes:
""All analyses followed a prespecified analysis plan, endorsed by the data monitoring and ethics committee, and were performed using Stata version 12 (StataCorp). All analyses were on an intention-to-treat basis and included all randomized patients in the groups to which they were randomized.""
""The primary analysis compared OSS data from the surgical and nonsurgical treatment groups over all 3 follow-up assessments (6, 12, and 24 months).""

The primary analysis was conducted on an intention-to-treat basis, including all randomized patients according to their assigned groups. Missing data were handled through use of multilevel modeling. No patients were excluded post-randomization. This reflects a pragmatic approach to the primary analysis.

Score: [5]","Eligibility:
Quotes:
""Of 1250 patients assessed for eligibility, 563 (45%) were eligible and 687 (55%) were ineligible (Figure 1). The most common reason for exclusion (>1 reason per patient possible) was that a patient had comorbidities that precluded surgery or anesthetic.""
""These characteristics were similar to patients who refused consent (mean age, 68 years; 75% female). Ineligible patients tended to be older (mean age, 70 years) and there were slightly fewer females (72%) (eTable 1 in Supplement 2).""

The trial excluded a significant proportion (55%) of patients assessed for eligibility, with the most common reasons being comorbidities precluding surgery/anesthesia and older age. The eligible patients differed somewhat from the ineligible patients in terms of age and sex. This suggests the eligibility criteria were more stringent than what would be typical in usual care for patients with displaced proximal humerus fractures.

Practices were recruited through primary care research networks, and patients were identified through electronic medical record searches and invited to participate. This recruitment approach is more systematic and resource-intensive than what would occur in usual care, where patients would likely just be referred during routine visits. However, the medical record searches are still a relatively pragmatic approach compared to more explanatory methods like targeted mailings or media advertisements.

""Practices were recruited with assistance from Primary Care Research Networks for London, Derby, and Nottingham.""

The trial was conducted in primary care practices in London, Nottingham, and Derby. This represents a fairly diverse, real-world setting where the intervention would be delivered in usual care. Conducting the trial in multiple cities increases the applicability. The only thing keeping this from being a 5 is that it's unclear if the specific practices are representative of the full spectrum that would offer the intervention in usual care.
