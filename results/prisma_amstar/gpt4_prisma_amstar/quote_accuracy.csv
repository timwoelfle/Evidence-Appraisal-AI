Advocates for IA cite ease of resection, low morbidity, no additional anesthetic risks, high incidence of disease in specimens, and elimination of confusion over future conflicting diagnosis [1]. Opponents argue that transecting an organ containing colonic flora in an otherwise clean procedure violates sound surgical principles and increases operative time and morbidity.

Results: Minimally invasive adrenalectomy appears superior to open adrenalectomy for small tumors. The potential advantages of MIA are appealing for postoperative pain, risk of intestinal obstruction, and quality of scars. The most common approach is the transperitoneal lateral laparoscopy, which allows for a large working space. For small tumors or for bilateral adrenalectomy, the prone retroperitoneoscopy is a promising new technique. In children, the learning curve is an issue because the indications are rare. The most common indication is neuroblastoma without image-defined surgical risk factors. The incidence of local recurrence is low, but the follow-up is short in most cases.

Methods: PUBMED, Web of science and Cochrane library were searched until Oct. 2014 to find eligible studies. WMD, OR, RD and their 95% CIs were used to estimate the difference.

All the meta-analyses were performed in Revman 5.2. Results: 15 comparative studies and one RCT were eligible and included in the meta-analysis. Compared with OP, LP groups might be associated with shorted length of hospital stay (WMD: -1.92, 95% CI: -2.45--1.39), reduced complications (OR: 0.71, 95% CI: 0.49-1.01) and equal success rate (RD: 0.01, 95% CI: -0.02-0.04), but prolonged operative time (WMD: 48.64, 95% CI: 31.16-66.12).

115,PRISMA,"Objective: The aim of this study was to explore the true efficacy and potential advantages of lymphatic sparing laparoscopic varicocelectomy (LSV) over lymphatic non-sparing laparoscopic varicocelectomy (LNSV) in children and adolescents. Methods: A search was made for studies published up until 31 August 2010 using the terms “lymphatic sparing varicocelectomy”, “laparoscopy”, “adolescent” and “children” in the Medline, Embase, Ovid, Web of Science, and Cochrane databases. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and observational clinical studies (OCSs) comparing LSV and LNSV were included. A systematic review and meta-analysis was performed using odds ratios (ORs) for dichotomous variables. Results: Out of 127 studies, 2 RCTs and 4 OCSs were eligible for inclusion, comprising 489 cases of LSV and 307 cases of LNSV. The hydrocele rates after LSV were significantly lower than after LNSV (OR = 0.19; 95 % confidence interval [CI] = 0.10 to 0.36; p < 0.00001).

Current guidelines do not recommend one treatment over the other, and there is ongoing uncertainty regarding clinical management. Methods: We conducted a structured search of Medline, Embase, trial registries, and the gray literature. We included studies that compared outcomes for FG and GJ in children with neurologic impairment. Results: We identified 556 children from three retrospective studies who underwent FG (n = 431) or GJ (n = 125). There were no differences in rates of pneumonia (17% vs 19%, p = 0.74) or mortality (13% vs 14%, p = 0.76). Few deaths were due to procedural complications (1%) or reflux (2%). There was a trend towards more major complications with FG (29%) compared to GJ (12%) (risk ratio = 1.70, 0.85–3.41, p = 0.14). Minor complications were more common with GJ (70%) than FG (45%), but this difference was also not statistically significant (risk ratio = 0.38, 0.05–3.07, p = 0.36).

120,PRISMA,"Abstract: Purpose: To comprehensively review the available evidences in the literature on the use of laparoscopic pyeloplasty (LP) vs open pyeloplasty (OP) for the repair of ureteropelvic junction (UPJ) obstruction in children. Materials and Methods: Published studies until the end of October 2010 were searched from Medline, Embase, Web of Science, Ovid, and Cochrane databases. The literature search, quality assessment, and data extraction were independently performed by two reviewers. A systematic review and meta-analysis were performed by using Review Manager 4.2.8 software. Results: Of 1403 studies, one randomized controlled trial (RCT), two prospective comparative studies, and six retrospective observational studies were eligible for inclusion criteria, comprising 694 cases of LP and 7334 cases of OP. The OP has significantly reduced operative time (weighted mean difference [WMD] = 59.00; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 41.15 to 76.85; P < 0.00001) and higher stent placement rate (odds ratio [OR] = 5.97; 95% CI = 3.17 to 11.26; P < 0.00001) compared with LP, whereas the duration of hospital stay was shorter in the LP group (WMD = - 0.40; 95% CI = - 0.77 to - 0.03; P = 0.03).

123,PRISMA,"Abstract: Background: Excision has been established as a standard management practice for choledochal cysts in the last few decades. The two most commonly performed methods of reconstruction after excision are hepaticoduodenostomy (HD) and Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy (HJ), of which the HJ is favored by most surgeons. Evidence concerning the optimal method of reconstruction is, however, sparse. Materials and Methods: Studies comparing outcomes from HD and HJ after choledochal cyst excision were identified by searching Medline, Ovid, Search Medica, Elsevier Clinicalkey, Google Scholar and Cochrane library. Suitable studies were chosen and data extracted for meta-analysis. Outcomes evaluated included operative time, hospital stay and incidence of postoperative bile leak, cholangitis, reflux/gastritis, anastomotic stricture, bleeding, intestinal obstruction and re-operative rate. Pooled odds ratios (OR) were calculated for dichotomous variables; pooled mean differences (MD) were measured for continuous variables. Results: Six retrospective studies were included in this meta-analysis, comprising a total of 679 patients, 412 of whom (60.7%) underwent HD, and the remainder, 267(39.3%) underwent HJ. Although, HD group had slightly shorter hospital stay (MD: 0.30; 95% CI: −0.22–0.39; P b 0.00001) it showed a higher incidence of postoperative reflux/gastritis (OR: 0.08; 95% CI: − 0.02–0.39; P = 0.002). However, the other outcomes such as bile leak, cholangitis, anastomotic stricture, bleeding, operative time, reoperation rate and adhesive intestinal obstruction did not differ between HD and HJ groups. Conclusions: HD shows higher postoperative reflux/gastritis than HJ but a shorter hospital stay.

134,PRISMA,"Objective: To determine overall complication rates of the tubularized incised plate (TIP) repair and assess the effects of technical modifications, length of follow-up and geographical location of reported results. Materials and methods: A systematic literature search was undertaken, using Medline and Pubmed, in order to identify relevant articles. Random effects models were used to estimate pooled complication rates. Meta-regression was performed for each outcome by using mixed effects models with type of hypospadias (primary distal, primary proximal and secondary) as predictors. Results: Of the 189 articles that were identified, 49 studies (4675 patients) were included in the analysis. Fistula and re-operation rates were significantly higher in secondary repairs (15.5% and 23.3%) compared to primary proximal (10.3% and 12.2%) and primary distal (5.7% and 4.5%) (P Z 0.045 and P < 0.001, respectively). Technical modifications reduced fistula rates from 10.3% to 3.3% (P Z 0.003) and re-operation rates from 13.6% to 2.8% (P Z 0.001). The rate of meatal stenosis was highest in the secondary repairs, with follow-up >1 year (12.7%). Comparison of geographical location showed that complication rates for all but one variable were significantly lower in North America when compared to Europe and the rest of the world. Mean meatal stenosis rates were 1.8% in North America, 3.4% in Europe and 8.2% in the rest of the world (P Z 0.002). This remained significant in a multivariable model incorporating repair technique and length of follow-up (P Z 0.046). Mean rates of urethral stricture, fistula and re-operation followed a similar pattern (P Z 0.045, P Z 0.009 and P < 0.001, respectively). Mean follow-up was shortest in the North American group, at 11.9 months, compared to Europe, at 17.8 months, and the rest of the world, at 18.9 months. Discussion: The present meta-analysis has shown that the lowest complication rates for the TIP repair are when it is applied to primary distal hypospadias. Complication rates are higher for all variables when the TIP repair is used for primary proximal hypospadias. Lower complication rates than those reported in this TIP review have been documented in some studies using a staged repair for correction of primary proximal or secondary hypospadias [11,12,68], implying that a staged approach may be superior to the TIP repair in these settings. Documentation of follow-up duration was limited, making assessment of the impact of length of follow-up difficult. Geographical location had a noticeable effect on outcome, with all but one complication being lower in the North American than the other groups. Mean follow-up was shortest in North America and it is suggested that the short follow-up in the North American studies may have led to under-reporting of late complications. Conclusion: The TIP repair has evolved to incorporate modifications that have significantly lowered complications.

We compared the complication rate of absorbable (Surgisis [SIS]; Cook Biotech, Inc, West Lafayette, IN) and nonabsorbable (polytetrafluoroethylene [PTFE]) materials for this purpose. Methods: This is a retrospective review of all neonates with CDH undergoing patch closure at our institution over 10 years.

Results: Primary patch (13 SIS, 9 PTFE) repair was performed in 22 (26%) of 84 patients with CDH.

141,PRISMA,"From this systematic review we conclude: A wide experience in SIPES and its feasibility have already been described with good clinical outcomes and low rate of conversion. The majority of the SIPES procedures were performed in the ‘‘children’’ and ‘‘adolescents’’ groups. Appendectomy is the unique procedure in which SIPES has demonstrated to be safe and effective. Some SIPES procedures can be performed with the same standard instruments of a conventional three-port laparoscopy in children, meaning no additional cost. Cosmesis seems to be a self-evident benefit of SIPES, although there is no objective assessment of it among authors in the literature, and it must be carefully weighed against the possibility of affecting the safety of the procedure. Experienced endoscopic surgeons might consider SIPES as another surgical approach to treat certain pathologies; however, the execution of prospective controlled trials is pending to demonstrate, with objective evidence, the real benefits of this less invasive approach. Pediatric patients have particular characteristics that allow minimally invasive surgery to be performed safely with the use of hybrid assistance, like reduced ports, stab incisions, and percutaneous retraction sutures.

146,PRISMA,"Abstract: Objective The laparoscopically-assisted anorectal pull-through (LAARP) for recto-bladderneck and recto-prostatic anorectal malformations (RB/RP-ARMs) is believed to improve patient outcomes. We performed a systematic review of the effect of LAARP on postoperative mucosal prolapse and defecation dysfunction. Methods A comprehensive search of MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL, and grey literature was performed (2000–2014). Full-text screening, data abstraction and quality appraisal were conducted in duplicate. Included studies reported a primary diagnosis of RB/RP-ARM and compared LAARP versus open repair (OPEN). Results From 3681 retrieved articles, 7 studies enrolling 187 patients were analyzed. One was a randomized control trial, 6 were retrospective observational studies, and all were single-centre. The majority were of poor-moderate quality (MINORS scores: mean 16.42 (SD 2.225) out of 24). Mucosal prolapse was not significantly different after LAARP versus OPEN (p = 0.18). Defecation outcomes were inconsistently reported but were no different between LAARP and OPEN for either children [3 years old (p = 0.84), or all ages combined (p = 0.11). Conclusion We found no significant difference in rates of mucosal prolapse or defecation scores for LAARP compared to OPEN for children with RB/RP-ARMs. However, studies are small and of poor-moderate quality and results are heterogeneous.

The exact etiology of choledochal cysts is unknown, but anomalous pancreaticobiliary duct union (APBDU) is seen in 30–70 % of all choledochal cysts where the common bile duct (CBD) and pancreatic duct junction occurs outside the duodenum, allowing reflux of pancreatic fluid into the biliary tree [3]. Besides the classic triad of abdominal pain, right upper quadrant mass and obstructive jaundice, choledochal cysts can be associated with serious complications such as cholangitis, pancreatitis, cholelithiasis and have a high risk in developing cholangiocarcinoma [4]. Thus, total cyst excision followed by Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy reconstruction is recommended for most patients with choledochal cysts whenever possible [5]. Laparoscopic excision of choledochal cysts has increasingly gained acceptance and applicability since its first description by Farello [6].

Methods Studies comparing the laparoscopic and the open choledochal cyst excision that met the inclusion criteria for data extraction were identified from electronic databases (PubMed, Embase, Science Citation Index, and the Cochrane Library) up to November 2014. The proceedings of relevant congress were also searched. The outcomes were operative time, intraoperative blood loss, time to food intake, postoperative morbidity and mortality, length of hospital stay. Outcomes were calculated as odds ratios (ORs) with 95 % confidence intervals (CIs) using RevMan 5.2. Results Seven retrospective studies were finally included, involving a total of 1016 patients, of whom, 408 cases underwent laparoscopic cyst excision and Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy (LH) and 608 cases underwent open cyst excision and Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy (OH).

150,PRISMA,"Abstract: Background: Intestinal intussusception is a frequent cause of bowel obstruction in children. Initial treatment involves pneumatic reduction. If this fails, operative reduction is indicated. There is controversy regarding use of the laparoscopic (LAP) versus the conventional open approach. Patients and Methods: We performed a retrospective review of all children with intussusception who required operative reduction at our institution over a 12-year time period. We also performed a meta-analysis to combine our data with the published literature. Results: We identified 28 patients requiring operative intervention for reduction of intussusception between January 2000 and April 2012. Five patients underwent LAP reduction, and 23 patients underwent open reduction. Operative times were not statistically different. The rate of overall complications was not statistically different, with 1 of 5 (20%) and 7 of 23 (30%) having complications in the LAP and open groups, respectively. Mean length of stay was 3.8 – 2.1 days in both the LAP and open groups, with no significant difference. Our meta-analysis identified five retrospective studies comparing LAP and open techniques for reduction of intussusception. We did not find a significant difference between groups with respect to operative time, overall complication rates, or re-operation rates. However, the length of hospital stay was significantly longer in the open group. Conclusions: LAP reduction of intussusception is a safe and feasible alternative to the open approach.

152,PRISMA,"Abstract: Background: Improvements in laparoscopic surgery have led to the introduction of laparoendoscopic single-site surgery (LESS) as an alternative to conventional laparoscopy conferring a number of possible advantages. In this review, we aim to elucidate the aspects of LESS for major urological procedures in the pediatric population. Materials and methods: An in-depth search of the literature was performed in the databases of PubMed and Scopus, for studies investigating the technical aspects and clinical outcomes of partial nephrec- tomies, nephrectomies, nephroureterectomies, varicocelectomies and pyeloplasties in children. Data on parameters such as operation time, instrumentation, perioperative complications, hospital stay and follow up period were collected and further analyzed cumulatively. Results: Twenty nine studies met the inclusion criteria incorporating 386 patients who underwent 401 procedures. There were no major intraoperative complications, with only 19 patients (4.73%) facing postoperative complications. No perioperative deaths were reported. Conclusions: In the hands of experienced surgeons LESS seems a feasible, efficient and less invasive alternative to standard laparoscopy in the field of pediatric urology. There is an eminent need of well- designed randomized controlled trials comparing the two techniques.",fulltext,"c t Background: Improvements in laparoscopic surgery have led to the introduction of laparoendoscopic single-site surgery (LESS) as an alternative to conventional laparoscopy conferring a number of possible advantages.

However, nephron-sparing surgery (NSS, or partial nephrectomy) has recently been gaining increasing attention. The objective of this systematic review is to compare the effectiveness of NSS as compared with RN for the treatment of children with WT. Methods: We searched the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, clinicaltrials.gov, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Google Scholar, and recently presented meeting abstracts for reports in English. The bibliographies of included studies were then hand-searched for any missed articles. The protocol was prospectively registered. Manuscripts were assessed and data abstracted in duplicate with differences resolved by the senior author. Owing to high heterogeneity among the final included studies, only a qualitative systematic review was performed; no formal meta-analysis was undertaken. Results: We identified 694 articles, 118 of which were selected for full-text review and 66 of which were included in the final analysis. Most studies were single- or multi-institution retrospective case series (60, 91%), with a small number of prospective cohort studies (6, 9%) and 1 administrative database analysis. Most studies were from Europe (27, 41%) or North America (21, 32%). Nearly half (32, 48%) of studies those were included were dated from 2010 or later. In total, data on 4,002 patients were included, of whom 1,040 (26%) underwent NSS and 2,962 (74%) underwent NSS. Reported rupture rates were similar between RN and NSS (13% vs. 7%), as were recurrence rates (12% vs. 11%) and survival rates (85% vs. 88%). However, these comparisons are limited by inherent biases in the design and reporting of most included studies. Conclusions: Most contemporary studies reporting the use of NSS in children with WT report similar long-term outcomes to RN. However, most existing studies are limited by their small numbers, inconsistent reporting, and methodological biases. There are significant opportunities for future research on the use of NSS in children with WT, including issues related to surgical quality, optimal technique, timing and duration of chemotherapy, and variation in the use of NSS among centers. r 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Patients and Methods A retrospective case study of children with an anorectal malformation who received a colostomy, born between January 1990 and July 2012. Furthermore, a systematic literature search on colostomies in neonates with an anorectal malformation or Hirschsprung disease. Colostomies were classified as loop or split colostomies in the transverse or sigmoid colon. Outcome measures were mortality and complications such as prolapse, technical difficulties with the reconstruction, urinary tract infections, and others. Results The mortality rate in the 180 children with anorectal malformation was 6%, and none of them were directly related to stoma formation or closure. The overall complication rate was 23% and the specific rates for the two types of procedures and the two locations of the colostomy did not differ (p ¼ 0.389 and p ¼ 0.667, respectively). All prolapses (n ¼ 22) occurred in loop colostomies in the transverse colon. One colostomy required revision because of insufficient length for the reconstruction. Urinary tract infections were not documented. A total of eight studies were included in the systematic review (1982–2011; 2,954 patients). Mortality ranged between 0.1 and 11%. Loop colostomies had more complications than split colostomies (63 vs. 45%; p ¼ 0.007), mainly prolapse (18 vs. 6%; p < 0.001).

Two studies reported on urinary tract infections which are as follows: One showed no difference between loop or split colostomies, whereas the other showed frequent episodes of urinary tract infections in 64% of the loop colostomies.

167,PRISMA,"Abstract: Purpose: Laparoscopic herniorrhaphy (LH) has been evolved as a minimally invasive technique for pediatric inguinal hernias (PIHs). Considerable debate exists regarding the benefits of LH over conventional open herniorrhaphy (OH). The aim of this review was to critique the current literature to determine the efficacy of LH. Methods: Published studies until July 30, 2010, were searched from Medline, Embase, Ovid, Web of Science, and Cochrane databases. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and observational clinical studies (OCSs) with a comparison of LH and OH were included. A systemic review and meta-analysis were performed using the odds ratios (ORs) for dichotomous variables and weighted mean differences (WMDs) for continuous variables. Results: Of 138 studies, 3 RCTs and 4 OCSs were eligible for inclusion criteria, comprising 1543 cases of LH and 657 cases of OH. Compared with OH, shorter operative time for bilateral hernias (WMD = −11.14; 95% confidence interval [CI], −20.61 to −1.68; P = .02) and lower rate of metachronic contralateral hernia (OR, 0.26; 95% CI, 0.09-0.76; P = .01) were noted in LH. However, no significant difference was observed between LH and OH in patients' age, sex, affected side, operative time for unilateral hernias, duration of hospital stay, time to resume full activity, recurrence, and complications. Conclusions: Laparoscopic herniorrhaphy is superior to OH in the repair of bilateral PIH and lower rate of metachronic contralateral hernia, with similar operative time for unilateral hernias, length of hospital stay, recurrence, and complication rates.

We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of outcomes comparing these techniques. Methods: A registered systematic review (PROSPERO: CRD42015016745) of comparative studies was performed, querying multiple databases without language or date restrictions. Gray literature was sought. Outcomes analyzed included: mortality, ventilation days, feeding parameters, length of stay (LOS), wound infection, resource utilization, and umbilical hernia incidence. Multiple reviewers independently assessed study eligibility and literature quality. Meta-analysis of outcomes was performed where appropriate (Revman 5.2). Results: Twelve studies met inclusion criteria, of which three were multi-institutional. Quality assessment revealed unbiased patient selection and exposure, but group comparability was suboptimal in four studies. Over- all, 1124 patients were evaluated, of which 350 underwent flap closure (210 immediately; 140 post-silo). Meta- analysis revealed no significant differences in mortality, LOS, or feeding parameters between groups. Flap patients had less wound infections (OR 0.40 [95%CI 0.22–0.74], P = 0.003). While flap patients had an increased risk of umbilical hernia, they were less likely to undergo repair (19% vs. 41%; P = 0.01).

Methods A literature search was performed using the PubMed database, Embase, and the Cochrane central register of controlled trials using a defined set of criteria. The outcomes, which include post-operative mortality, incidence of hernia recurrence, rates of patch use and complications, were analyzed. Results We investigated nine studies, which included 507 patients. All studies were non-randomized historical control trials. The MIS group had a significantly lower rate of post-operative death with a risk ratio of 0.26 [95 % confidence interval (CI) 0.10–0.68; p = 0.006] but a greater incidence of hernia recurrence with a risk ratio of 3.42 (95 % CI 1.98–5.88; p \ 0.00001). Rates of prosthetic patch use were similar between the two groups. Fewer cases of surgical complications were found in the MIS group with a risk ratio of 0.66 (95 % CI 0.47–0.94; p = 0.02). Conclusions MIS for CDH repair is associated with lower post-operative mortality and morbidity compared with traditional open repair. Although rate of patch use appears to be comparable, the increased risk of CDH recurrence should not be ignored.

64,PRISMA,"Abstract: Objective: To identify methods of improving the evidence base in smaller surgical specialties, using a systematic review of gastroschisis management as an example. Background: Operative primary fascial closure (OPFC), and silo placement with staged reduction and delayed closure (SR) are the most commonly used methods of gastroschisis closure. Relative merits of each are unclear. Methods: A systematic review and meta-analysis was performed comparing outcomes following OPFC and SR in infants with simple gastroschisis. Primary outcomes of interest were mortality, length of hospitalization and time to full enteral feeding. Results: 751 unique articles were identified. Eight met the inclusion criteria. None were randomized controlled trials. 488 infants underwent OPFC and 316 underwent SR. Multiple studies were excluded because they included heterogeneous populations and mixed intervention groups. Length of stay was significantly longer in the SR group (mean difference 8.97 days, 95% CI 2.14–15.80 days), as was number of post-operative days to complete enteral feeding (mean difference 7.19 days, 95%CI 2.01–12.36 days). Mortality was not statistically significantly different, although the odds of death were raised in the SR group (OR 1.96, 95%CI 0.71–5.35). Conclusions: Despite showing some benefit of OPFC over SR, our results are tempered by the low quality of the available studies, which were small and variably reported.

The underlying cause of stricture was caustic ingestion in 19 (61.2%), esophageal surgery in 7 (22.6%), and others in 5 children (16.2%). The median age of the patients was 48 months (range 4 to 276 months). In the majority of cases cotton pledgets soaked in solution of Mitomycin C were applied endoscopically. Various other techniques such as drug-eluting stents were used. Mitomycin C was applied from 1 to 12 times within intervals from 1 to 12 weeks.

72,PRISMA,"Abstract: Purpose: Laparoscopic varicocelectomy has gained popularity in recent years. The aim of this study was to identify clinical evidence about the reliability of this technique in the recent literature. Methods: We performed a Medline search for articles published during the last 10 years, using the key words “varicocele,” “treatment,” and “adolescent.” As limits, we used last 10 years, adolescent, clinical trials, randomized controlled trials, meta-analysis, and multicenter retrospective and prospective studies. The results were investigated in recurrence and hydrocele formation. Results: We pooled 37 studies, but 26 of these were excluded because they were neither relevant nor concerned an adolescent population. Meta-analysis showed that there was no statistical difference between laparoscopic surgery and open surgery in recurrence rate and postoperative hydrocele rate. In the laparoscopic group, the incidence of recurrence was higher in the patients undergoing artery ligation compared to patients undergoing artery and venous ligation. Furthermore, a lower rate of postoperative hydrocele was recorded in patients undergoing dye injections before laparoscopic ligation. Conclusions: Meta-analysis and literature analysis showed that the results after laparoscopic varicocelectomy are comparable to other surgical procedures.

The benefits of TERPT over the conventional transabdominal approach (TAB) are still unclear. We performed a comprehensive meta-analysis comparing the clinical outcomes of TERPT and TAB. Methods: Original articles published from 1998 to 2012 were searched from Medline, Embase, and Cochrane databases. Randomized controlled trials (RCT) and observational clinical studies (OCS) comparing TERPT and TAB were included. Outcomes evaluated included operative time, hospital stay and incidence of postoperative incontinence/soiling, constipation and enterocolitis. Pooled odds ratios (OR) were calculated for dichotomous variables; pooled mean differences (MD) were measured for continuous variables. Results: Of 93 studies, 1 RCT and 11 OCS were included, comprising 444 cases of TERPT and 348 cases of TAB (215 Soave, 94 Duhamel, 24 Swenson, 15 Rehbein procedures).

94,PRISMA,"Abstract: Purpose: To compare LILT and STEP, the two principal procedures to lengthen the native bowel in children with a short bowel syndrome (SBS), by discussing the indications and presenting the outcome from published data. Methods: A review of literature was performed. N = 39 publications were reviewed. Results: For LILT and STEP, failure to achieve intestinal autonomy by conservative therapy represents the main indication, and end-stage liver disease the main contraindication. A sufficiently dilated intestinal segment is a common anatomical precondition for both procedures. STEP can be performed on shorter intestinal segments and on intricate segments such as the duodenum, which is technically not feasible for LILT. Both procedures have a similar extent of intestinal lengthening (approximately 70%) and result in improvement of enteral nutrition and reversal of complications of parenteral nutrition. STEP seems to have a lower mortality and overall progression to transplantation. Conclusions: STEP and LILT are both accepted procedures for non-transplant surgical management of SBS in children. The outcome after STEP seems to be more favourable, but larger series are needed to further assess accurate selection of eligible patients and to estimate effectiveness of procedures.
