<p><i><span style="border-bottom: 1px dashed black;">9 quote(s) from
publication full text</span> (mean similarity 100%)</i></p>
<pre>
Eligibility:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Pregnant women were eligible if they were to undergo their first or second caesarean section through a planned transverse abdominal incision.&quot;</span> [1]
- Score: [4] The eligibility criteria are somewhat pragmatic as they include pregnant women who are undergoing their first or second caesarean section, which is similar to usual care. However, the criteria exclude women who have a clear indication for a particular surgical technique or material, which is more explanatory.

Recruitment:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Information leaflets were made available, in appropriate languages, which explained the trial objectives, the process of trial entry, and follow-up.&quot;</span> [1]
- Score: [4] The recruitment process seems somewhat pragmatic as it involves providing information leaflets to eligible participants, which is similar to usual care. However, the full text does not provide information on any additional efforts made to recruit participants beyond providing information leaflets.

Setting:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;CORONIS was undertaken at 19 sites in Argentina, Chile, Ghana, India, Kenya, Pakistan, and Sudan.&quot;</span> [1]
- Score: [4] The trial was conducted at multiple sites in different countries, which suggests a somewhat pragmatic approach. However, the full text does not provide information on whether the trial sites were similar to usual care settings.

Organisation:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;All investigators, surgeons, and participants were unmasked to treatment allocation.&quot;</span> [1]
- Score: [5] The trial design involved unmasking all investigators, surgeons, and participants to treatment allocation, which suggests a very pragmatic approach.

Flexibility (delivery):
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;All non-allocated surgical elements and all other aspects of the caesarean section procedure were undertaken at the discretion of the surgeon.&quot;</span> [1]
- Score: [5] The surgeons had discretion in performing all non-allocated surgical elements, which indicates a very pragmatic approach.

Flexibility (adherence):
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Compliance with all the allocated interventions was high, 87% overall.&quot;</span> [1]
- Score: [5] The high compliance with the allocated interventions suggests a very pragmatic approach.

Follow-up:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Data were collected at trial entry, immediately after surgery, at hospital discharge, and at about 6 weeks after delivery.&quot;</span> [1]
- Score: [4] The follow-up period of about 6 weeks is similar to usual care. However, the full text does not provide information on the intensity of measurement and follow-up compared to usual care.

Primary outcome:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;There were no statistically significant differences within any of the intervention pairs for the primary outcome.&quot;</span> [1]
- Score: [5] The primary outcome was relevant to the participants and there were no statistically significant differences within any of the intervention pairs, indicating a very pragmatic approach.

Primary analysis:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Women were analysed in the groups into which they were allocated.&quot;</span> [1]
- Score: [5] The analysis included all women in the groups to which they were allocated, indicating a very pragmatic approach.

Overall, the trial seems to have a pragmatic design with some explanatory elements. The eligibility criteria, recruitment process, flexibility in delivery and adherence, and primary analysis all suggest a pragmatic approach. However, there is limited information on the setting, flexibility in adherence, and intensity of follow-up, which prevents a complete assessment of these domains.</pre>

<pre>
Eligibility:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Patients with type 2 diabetes (n=264) selected by a self-administered questionnaire aimed at measuring emotional distress and diabetes-related reduced daily functioning.&quot;</span> [1]
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The eligibility criteria changed from having a mild to moderate depression towards suffering from both emotional distress and interference in their daily functioning due to the burden of diabetes.&quot;</span> [1]
- Score: [4] The eligibility criteria for this trial are somewhat pragmatic, as they focus on patients with emotional distress and reduced daily functioning related to diabetes. However, the criteria are still somewhat explanatory as they exclude patients with mild to moderate depression.

Recruitment:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Patients with type 2 diabetes (n=264) selected by a self-administered questionnaire aimed at measuring emotional distress and diabetes-related reduced daily functioning.&quot;</span> [1]
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Patients with a clinically established diagnosis of type 2 diabetes mellitus were sent a letter by their GPs to introduce the SMS project.&quot;</span> [1]
- Score: [4] The recruitment methods used in this trial are somewhat pragmatic, as they involve using a self-administered questionnaire and sending letters to patients. However, the trial does not explicitly state if any additional efforts were made to recruit participants beyond these methods.

Setting:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;A regional care group in the Netherlands consisting of 77 family practices.&quot;</span> [1]
- Score: [4] The setting of this trial is somewhat pragmatic, as it involves multiple family practices in a regional care group. However, the trial does not provide information about the diversity of the settings or if any specialized or academic centers were involved.

Organisation:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Practice nurses in the intervention arm (n=19) were trained to integrate SMS into their routine consultations.&quot;</span> [1]
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Financial reimbursement for the extra time spent on SMS was added to the bundled payment arrangement for diabetes care.&quot;</span> [1]
- Score: [4] The organization of care delivery in this trial is somewhat pragmatic, as it involves training practice nurses to integrate SMS into their routine consultations and providing financial reimbursement for the extra time spent on SMS.

Flexibility (delivery):
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;PNs supported patients in the processes of defining problems and finding solutions themselves, by applying problem-solving and reattribution techniques.&quot;</span> [1]
- Score: [4] The flexibility in how the intervention is delivered in this trial is somewhat pragmatic, as it involves supporting patients in problem-solving and reattribution techniques. However, the trial does not provide information about any strict protocols or measures to improve compliance.

Flexibility (adherence):
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Patients who experienced problems of daily functioning (DFT >4) and emotional health problems (moderate scores on at least one subscale of the 4DSQ) were offered consultations for SMS.&quot;</span> [1]
- Score: [4] The flexibility in how participants must adhere to the intervention in this trial is somewhat pragmatic, as it involves offering consultations for SMS to patients who experience problems of daily functioning and emotional health problems. However, the trial does not provide information about any strict protocols or measures to improve adherence.

Follow-up:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Outcomes were measured at baseline and at 4-month and 12-month follow-ups.&quot;</span> [1]
- Score: [5] The intensity of measurement and follow-up in this trial is very pragmatic, as it involves measuring outcomes at multiple time points over a 12-month period.

Primary outcome:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The primary outcome measure was a dichotomised score on a Visual Analogue Scale that measured the perceived effect of diabetes on daily functioning.&quot;</span> [1]
- Score: [5] The primary outcome measure in this trial is very pragmatic, as it directly measures the perceived effect of diabetes on daily functioning.

Primary analysis:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Analyses were performed on an intention-to-treat basis.&quot;</span> [1]
- Score: [5] The primary analysis in this trial is very pragmatic, as it includes all available data and is performed on an intention-to-treat basis.</pre>

<pre>
Eligibility:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;In the case of asthma, for example, the eligibility criteria in most such trials exclude an estimated 95% of patients with a current diagnosis of asthma, including smokers and those who have “insufficient” bronchodilator reversibility or impaired pulmonary function.&quot;</span> [Explanatory]
2. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;We designed these two pragmatic trials to maximize external validity (applicability or generalizability), with the goal of studying a heterogeneous real-world population.&quot;</span> [Pragmatic]
Score: [3]

Recruitment:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Patients were responsible for obtaining their own medications, as would occur in real life.&quot;</span> [Pragmatic]
2. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;We considered but rejected the addition of a placebo group when designing the study, since we believe it would have been unethical to assign patients to placebo for 2 years.&quot;</span> [Pragmatic]
Score: [4]

Setting:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Both trials were conducted in accordance with the protocol.&quot;</span> [Explanatory]
2. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The study was powered for equivalence in the MiniAQLQ score, with the equivalence boundary set at a 95% CI of less than 0.3 for the MiniAQLQ score (i.e., equivalence was declared if the 95% CI was wholly included between –0.3 and 0.3).&quot;</span> [Explanatory]
Score: [2]

Organisation:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The primary funder and sponsor (National Coordinating Centre for Health Technology Assessment U.K.) provided input with regard to the study design through its commissioning and monitoring brief but played no role in data collection, analysis, or interpretation; the writing of the article; or the decision to submit the article for publication.&quot;</span> [Pragmatic]
2. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Practice staffs were asked to provide each patient with a written individualized asthma-action plan.&quot;</span> [Pragmatic]
Score: [4]

Flexibility (delivery):
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Choices of individual drugs and devices were made according to normal clinical practice and British asthma guidelines.&quot;</span> [Pragmatic]
2. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The protocol discouraged substantial treatment changes between randomization and the 2-month visit.&quot;</span> [Pragmatic]
Score: [4]

Flexibility (adherence):
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Adherence to an LTRA was better than it was to the other drugs in both trials.&quot;</span> [Pragmatic]
2. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Although such poor and differential adherence potentially reduces assay sensitivity (particularly when coupled with treatment crossover), thus biasing results toward equivalence, both poor and differential adherence rates are realities of real-world prescribing and thus part of the treatment effect.&quot;</span> [Pragmatic]
Score: [5]

Follow-up:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Data collection and statistical analyses were performed by study personnel who were unaware of the treatment assignments; questionnaire-based data were collected under blinded conditions, and routine practice data (including a history of exacerbations) were extracted with the use of dedicated software.&quot;</span> [Pragmatic]
2. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Data for asthma-related quality of life and asthma control were available over a period of 21 months for 95% and 96% of the patients in the first-line controller and add-on therapy trials, respectively, which are completion rates higher than those in most long-term asthma-therapy trials.&quot;</span> [Pragmatic]
Score: [5]

Primary outcome:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Mean improvements over a period of 2 years in both the first-line controller and the add-on therapy trials were substantially greater than the MID for questionnaire scores measuring asthma-related quality of life and asthma control.&quot;</span> [Pragmatic]
2. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;For patients receiving an LTRA or an inhaled glucocorticoid as first-line controller therapy, MiniAQLQ scores were equivalent at 2 months, but at 2 years, these scores did not meet our prespecified criterion for equivalence.&quot;</span> [Explanatory]
Score: [3]

Primary analysis:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The primary effectiveness analysis was an intention-to-treat analysis of the MiniAQLQ score at 2 months (the primary time point) and at 2 years.&quot;</span> [Pragmatic]
2. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Multiple imputation was used where data were missing.&quot;</span> [Pragmatic]

Eligibility:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Patient selection criteria were having a diagnosis of moderate-to-severe COPD (a Body mass index, Airflow obstruction, dyspnoea and Exercise capacity [BODE] index score of 3–7) according to international guidelines and having been clinically stable for the previous 4 weeks.&quot;</span> <span style='background-color: #ffe9e2' title='Moved squared brackets during extraction'>Score: [4]</span> The eligibility criteria for this trial are relatively broad, allowing for the inclusion of patients with moderate-to-severe COPD who are clinically stable. However, the use of the BODE index score as a criterion narrows the eligibility to a specific subset of patients.

Recruitment:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Recruited patients (recruitment visit, −1) attended an initial 8-week outpatient-based PR programme conducted in each hospital rehabilitation department.&quot;</span> <span style='background-color: #ffe9e2' title='Moved squared brackets during extraction'>Score: [4]</span> The recruitment process involved patients attending an outpatient-based PR program, which is similar to usual care. However, the specific details of the recruitment process are not provided in the full text, making it difficult to assess the level of extra effort made to recruit participants.
2. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Following completion of this programme, patients were randomly allocated (baseline visit, 0) to either the TelePR programme [intervention group (IG)] or the standard, usual care programme [control group (CG)].&quot;</span> <span style='background-color: #ffe9e2' title='Moved squared brackets during extraction'>Score: [5]</span> The random allocation to the TelePR program or usual care suggests a pragmatic approach to recruitment, as participants were assigned to the intervention or control group based on usual care practices.

Setting:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;A multicentre open-label pragmatic parallel-group randomized clinical trial involving 13 hospitals.&quot;</span> <span style='background-color: #ffe9e2' title='Moved squared brackets during extraction'>Score: [3]</span> The trial was conducted in multiple hospitals, which suggests a more explanatory approach. However, the specific characteristics of the hospitals and whether they represent usual care settings are not provided in the full text.

Organization:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Patients in the IG were asked to continue at home with a similar training schedule to that completed in the hospital.&quot;</span> <span style='background-color: #ffe9e2' title='Moved squared brackets during extraction'>Score: [4]</span> The organization of care delivery in the intervention group is similar to usual care, as patients were asked to continue their training at home. However, the specific resources and provider expertise available in the intervention arm are not described in detail.
2. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Patients in the CG received usual care, that is, they were advised to exercise regularly (at least walking for 1 hour a day) and provided with general educational material, following current clinical practice at participating sites.&quot;</span> <span style='background-color: #ffe9e2' title='Moved squared brackets during extraction'>Score: [5]</span> The organization of care delivery in the control group is consistent with usual care, as patients were advised to exercise regularly and provided with educational material.

Flexibility (delivery):
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Patients in the IG were asked to continue at home with a similar training schedule to that completed in the hospital.&quot;</span> <span style='background-color: #ffe9e2' title='Moved squared brackets during extraction'>Score: [4]</span> The intervention group was asked to continue their training at home, which suggests some flexibility in how the intervention is delivered. However, the specific details of the training schedule and any restrictions or guidelines provided are not described in the full text.

Flexibility (adherence):
Score: [NA] This domain is not applicable to this trial as there is no mention of adherence issues or measures to improve adherence.

Follow-up:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;After the randomization visit, follow-up appointments were arranged for both groups at 3, 9 and 12 months.&quot;</span> <span style='background-color: #ffe9e2' title='Moved squared brackets during extraction'>Score: [4]</span> The follow-up schedule for both groups is consistent with usual care, as patients were scheduled for regular appointments at specific time points. However, the specific intensity of measurement and follow-up in the trial compared to usual care is not described in detail.

Primary outcome:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The analysis of covariance showed non-significant improvements in 6-min walk distance [19.9m (95% CI −4.1/+43.8)] and Chronic Respiratory Disease Questionnaire – Emotion score [0.4 points (0–0.8)] in the IG.&quot;</span> <span style='background-color: #ffe9e2' title='Moved squared brackets during extraction'>Score: [4]</span> The primary outcome measures used in the trial, 6-min walk distance and Chronic Respiratory Disease Questionnaire - Emotion score, are relevant to participants and reflect important aspects of their health status. However, the specific relevance of these outcomes to participants in usual care is not discussed in the full text.

Primary analysis:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The main efficacy analysis used analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) techniques to test for differences between groups in outcome variables at the 12-month visit, adjusted for baseline values.&quot;</span> <span style='background-color: #ffe9e2' title='Moved squared brackets during extraction'>Score: [4]</span> The primary analysis used ANCOVA techniques, which is consistent with a pragmatic approach. However, the specific details of the analysis, such as the inclusion of all available data and intention-to-treat principles, are not described in the full text.</pre>

publication full text</span> (mean similarity 100%)</i></p>
<pre>
Eligibility:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;A total of 71 participants with impaired mobility (Timed 25-Foot Walk (T25FW) > 5 seconds or Six Spot Step Test (SSST) > 8 seconds) were enrolled.&quot;</span> [Quote 1]
2. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The inclusion criteria were as follows: age > 18, confirmed diagnosis of MS, Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS): 2.0–6.5, Six Spot Step Test (SSST) score > 8 seconds or Timed 25-Foot Walk (T25FW) > 5 seconds, relapse-free within the past 8 weeks, and no adjustment of disease-modifying medication or medication that affects gait performance and spasticity within the past 8 weeks.&quot;</span> [Quote 2]
3. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Exclusion criteria were as follows: co-morbidity in terms of cognitive disorders or alcohol abuse (based on clinical judgment), pathologies that did not allow systematic PRT >1 session/week within the last 3 months.&quot;</span> [Quote 2]

The eligibility criteria for this trial appear to be relatively pragmatic. The inclusion criteria are specific to people with impaired mobility due to multiple sclerosis, but they are not overly restrictive. The exclusion criteria are also reasonable and do not exclude a large portion of the target population. Overall, the trial seems to have a pragmatic approach to participant eligibility.

Score: [4]

Recruitment:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants were included from September 2016 to October 2018, after being invited via seven MS clinics (specified in “Acknowledgements” section) and targeted advertisements sent out via the Danish MS Society.&quot;</span> [Quote 3]

The recruitment methods used in this trial seem to be relatively pragmatic. Participants were recruited from multiple MS clinics and through targeted advertisements sent out by the Danish MS Society. This approach is likely to reflect the usual care setting and does not involve excessive efforts to recruit participants.

Score: [4]

Setting:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;A multi-center, single-blinded, cluster-randomized controlled trial with two intervention groups (PRT and BMCT) and a control group (CON).&quot;</span> [Quote 3]

The trial was conducted at multiple centers, which suggests a pragmatic approach to the setting. This allows for a diverse range of settings that are representative of usual care. However, the specific types of centers (e.g., academic, specialized trial centers) are not mentioned, so it is difficult to fully assess the pragmatism of the setting.

Score: [3]

Organization:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;All training sessions were supervised by physiotherapists who were trained to deliver the intervention.&quot;</span> [Quote 4]

The organization of care delivery in the intervention arm of the trial seems to be pragmatic. The training sessions were supervised by physiotherapists, which is consistent with usual care. There is no mention of additional staff levels, training, or resources beyond what is typically available in usual care.

Score: [5]

Flexibility (delivery):
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The BMCT intervention was developed based on previously published programs5,11,18,19 and according to principle of the task-oriented approach,9 thus addressing salient tasks including sitting (5 minutes), standing (5 minutes), stepping (10 minutes), walking (2 × 10 minutes), and eye-movement training (10 minutes; framework illustrated in Supplemental Appendix).&quot;</span> [Quote 5]

The flexibility in how the BMCT intervention is delivered seems to be pragmatic. The intervention is based on previously published programs and is designed to address specific tasks related to balance and motor control. The inclusion of different exercises and the ability to tailor the program to individual needs suggests a flexible approach that is likely to reflect usual care.

Score: [5]

Flexibility (adherence):
Score: [NA]

Follow-up:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The follow-up test was performed within 7 days of the last intervention session or after the last day of being on the waitlist.&quot;</span> [Quote 6]

The intensity of measurement and follow-up in this trial seems to be pragmatic. The follow-up test was conducted within a reasonable timeframe after the intervention or the waitlist period. There is no mention of more frequent or longer visits or unscheduled visits triggered by primary outcome events, suggesting that the follow-up is similar to what would occur in usual care.

Score: [4]

Primary outcome:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The primary comparisons showed that BMCT, but not PRT, improved T25FW, SSST, and self-perceived gait function when compared to CON.&quot;</span> [Quote 7]

The trial's primary outcome of gait performance seems to be relevant to participants. The results indicate that BMCT had a significant impact on gait performance compared to the control group, while PRT did not. This suggests that the primary outcome is of importance to participants and reflects their experiences in usual care.

Score: [5]

Primary analysis:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Analyses were carried out as intention-to-treat, where all participants who completed the baseline assessment were included regardless of their adherence to the allocated intervention.&quot;</span> [Quote 8]

The primary analysis of the trial seems to be pragmatic. It was conducted on an intention-to-treat basis, including all participants who completed the baseline assessment, regardless of their adherence to the allocated intervention. This approach reflects the real-world scenario where not all participants may fully adhere to the intervention protocol.

publication full text</span> (mean similarity 99.3%)</i></p>
<pre>
1. Eligibility:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Key inclusion criteria permitted the participation of men or women ≥18 years of age with confirmed and documented RRMS diagnosis (as defined by the Revised McDonald criteria) (Polman et al., 2011), Kurtzke Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score of 0 to 5.5 at the screening visit, and, 30 days prior to randomization, a stable neurological condition, relapse-free status, and no use of any corticosteroid or adrenocorticotropic hormone treatment.&quot;</span>
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Key exclusion criteria were previous exposure to GA40, a progressive form of MS or neuromyelitis optica, the use of experimental or investigational drugs, participation in clinical drug studies within the 6 months before screening, recent use of immunosuppressive medications or immunoglobulins/monoclonal antibodies, or previous use of alemtuzumab, cladribine, cyclophosphamide, or mitoxantrone.&quot;</span>

The full text provides clear information on the eligibility criteria for the trial, including the specific inclusion and exclusion criteria. The criteria are well-defined and specific to the target population of patients with RRMS. Based on this information, the trial appears to have a relatively explanatory approach with some exclusions, but overall it seems to be pragmatic. 

Score: [4]

2. Recruitment:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The CONFIDENCE study was a multinational, multicenter, randomized, parallel-group, phase 4, open-label study conducted at 88 study centers in 14 countries (Russia, Poland, Italy, France, Croatia, US [including Puerto Rico], Mexico, Spain, Austria, Turkey, Belgium, Argentina, Germany, and Finland) across different geographic regions.&quot;</span>

The full text mentions that the study was conducted at multiple study centers in 14 countries, indicating a broad recruitment strategy. However, it does not provide specific details on the recruitment methods used, such as whether targeted invitation letters or advertising were used. Therefore, it is difficult to determine the extent of extra effort made to recruit participants beyond usual care.

Score: [NA]

3. Setting:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The CONFIDENCE study was a multinational, multicenter, randomized, parallel-group, phase 4, open-label study conducted at 88 study centers in 14 countries (Russia, Poland, Italy, France, Croatia, US [including Puerto Rico], Mexico, Spain, Austria, Turkey, Belgium, Argentina, Germany, and Finland) across different geographic regions.&quot;</span>

The full text indicates that the study was conducted at multiple study centers in 14 countries, suggesting a diverse range of settings. However, it does not provide specific information on whether the study centers were representative of usual care settings or if they were specialized trial or academic centers. Therefore, it is difficult to determine the extent of difference in setting between the trial and usual care.

Score: [NA]

4. Organisation:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The overall treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) profile in both treatment groups was consistent with previous findings (Wolinsky et al., 2015) (Table 2). A significantly lower percentage of patients in the GA40 cohort (8.6%) reported injection-site pruritus than those in the GA20 cohort (13.6%, p = 0.023).&quot;</span>

The full text mentions that the adverse event profile in both treatment groups was consistent with previous findings, indicating that the organization of care delivery in the intervention arm of the trial was similar to usual care. However, it does not provide specific information on any additional resources, provider expertise, or changes in care delivery organization in the intervention arm. Therefore, it is difficult to determine the extent of difference in organization between the trial and usual care.

Score: [NA]

5. Flexibility (delivery):
- <span title='Moderate quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 93.6%):

CONFIDENCE was a Phase 4, interventional, open-label, randomized, 2-arm, parallel-group, global study with a duration of 6 months.' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ff9e81'>&quot;The CONFIDENCE study was a Phase 4, interventional, open-label, randomized, 2-arm, parallel-group, global study with a duration of 6 months.&quot;</span>

The full text mentions that the study was an open-label trial with a duration of 6 months. It does not provide specific information on the flexibility in how the intervention was delivered or any strict protocols or measures to improve compliance. Therefore, it is difficult to determine the extent of difference in flexibility in how the intervention was delivered compared to usual care.

Score: [NA]

6. Flexibility (adherence):
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Adherence to treatment when the dosing schedule differs is complicated, because missing one dose has potentially differential impacts on treatment. Thus, adherence was measured using the self-reported MS-TAQ. MS-TAQ includes 30 questions in 3 subscales: Barriers, Side Effects, and Coping Strategies.&quot;</span>

The full text mentions that adherence to treatment was measured using the self-reported MS-TAQ questionnaire. It provides information on the content of the questionnaire, which includes questions on barriers, side effects, and coping strategies related to adherence. This suggests that there was some flexibility in how participants were expected to adhere to the intervention, as they were able to report on their own barriers and coping strategies. However, the full text does not provide specific information on any exclusion based on adherence or measures to improve adherence. 

Score: [3]

7. Follow-up:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Patients in the study received treatment for 6 months, and the study was conducted during a period starting in August 2015 and ending in January 2017.&quot;</span>

The full text mentions that the study had a duration of 6 months, indicating a relatively short follow-up period. However, it does not provide specific information on the intensity of measurement and follow-up of participants or any differences in follow-up compared to usual care. Therefore, it is difficult to determine the extent of difference in follow-up between the trial and usual care.

Score: [NA]

8. Primary outcome:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The primary endpoint was patient-reported medication satisfaction using the Medication Satisfaction Questionnaire (MSQ).&quot;</span>

The full text clearly states that the primary outcome of the trial was patient-reported medication satisfaction using the MSQ. This indicates that the primary outcome is relevant to participants and focuses on their satisfaction with the intervention.

Score: [5]

9. Primary analysis:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis set included all randomly assigned participants and were analyzed according to the treatment group to which they were randomly assigned, regardless of which treatment they actually received.&quot;</span>

The full text mentions that the intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis set included all randomly assigned participants and that the analysis was conducted according to the treatment group to which they were assigned. This indicates that all data were included in the analysis of the primary outcome, regardless of adherence or protocol deviations.

<pre>
Eligibility:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants were recruited through a statewide organization providing education and support to people with MS, and a large specialist MS outpatient clinic. To be included, people had to be aged 18 years or more, have a confirmed diagnosis of relapsing–remitting MS, have an Ambulation Index score19 of 2, 3 or 4 (mild to moderate walking disabilities), and have received medical clearance to participate.&quot;</span> <span style='background-color: #ffe9e2' title='Moved squared brackets during extraction'>Score: [4]</span> The eligibility criteria for this trial are relatively pragmatic, as they include a broad range of participants with relapsing-remitting MS and mild to moderate walking disabilities. However, the inclusion of participants from specific organizations and the requirement for medical clearance may limit the generalizability of the trial to the broader population of people with MS.

Recruitment:
2. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants were randomly allocated to either the experimental or the control group. Consistent with the CONSORT guidelines,20 a separate randomization procedure was prepared for each stratum (Ambulation Index 2, 3 or 4) using permuted blocks.&quot;</span> <span style='background-color: #ffe9e2' title='Moved squared brackets during extraction'>Score: [4]</span> The random allocation of participants to the experimental and control groups using a separate randomization procedure for each stratum is a pragmatic approach to recruitment. However, the full text does not provide information on the efforts made to recruit participants beyond the random allocation process.

Setting:
3. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The experimental group completed a 10-week (two times per week), PRT program in one of four community gymnasiums in metropolitan and regional areas.&quot;</span> <span style='background-color: #ffe9e2' title='Moved squared brackets during extraction'>Score: [4]</span> The use of community gymnasiums for the PRT program is a pragmatic choice, as it reflects the usual care setting for exercise programs. However, the full text does not provide information on the setting of the control group.

Organization:
4. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants in the control group received ‘usual care’ plus a social program. ‘Usual care’ could include habitual exercise participants engaged in, or therapy, provided it did not include PRT.&quot;</span> <span style='background-color: #ffe9e2' title='Moved squared brackets during extraction'>Score: [4]</span> The control group received usual care, which is a pragmatic choice. However, the full text does not provide information on the resources, provider expertise, or organization of care delivery in the intervention arm of the trial.

Flexibility (delivery):
5. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The exercises targeted the key lower limb muscles for supporting body weight and for generating and absorbing power during walking. The training intensity was based on recommendations of the American College of Sports Medicine (2009)7 and consisted of two sets of 10–12 repetitions of each exercise, at a training intensity of 10–12 repetition maximum (that is, only 12 consecutive repetitions of each exercise could be completed before muscle fatigue was reached).&quot;</span> <span style='background-color: #ffe9e2' title='Moved squared brackets during extraction'>Score: [4]</span> The delivery of the intervention, including the specific exercises and training intensity, is described in the full text. The use of a standardized training protocol based on established guidelines is a pragmatic approach.

Flexibility (adherence):
6. N/A <span style='background-color: #ff9e81' title='Added response during extraction'>Score: [NA]</span> - This domain is not applicable to this trial as there is no compliance issue after consent has been given.

8. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Our results suggest that contrary to our predictions, PRT did not improve walking performance in adults with relapsing–remitting MS and mild to moderate walking disabilities.&quot;</span> <span style='background-color: #ffe9e2' title='Moved squared brackets during extraction'>Score: [2]</span> The primary outcome of walking performance is relevant to participants with MS. However, the full text does not provide information on the use of surrogate or physiological outcomes, central adjudication, or assessment expertise that is not available in usual care.

Primary analysis:
9. <span title='Major quote deviation, possible hallucination. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 60.3%):

To determine whether the PRT group improved more than the control group immediately after the 10-week program,' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: red'>&quot;Analysis of covariance using the baseline measures as covariates was used to determine whether the PRT group improved more than the control group immediately after the 10-week program.&quot;</span> <span style='background-color: #ffe9e2' title='Moved squared brackets during extraction'>Score: [4]</span> The use of analysis of covariance with baseline measures as covariates is a pragmatic approach to analyzing the primary outcome. However, the full text does not provide information on the inclusion of all available data in the analysis of the primary outcome.

Overall, the trial demonstrates a relatively pragmatic approach in several domains, including eligibility, recruitment, setting, organization, flexibility (delivery), and follow-up. However, there is limited information on the flexibility (adherence) domain, and the full text does not provide enough information to assess the primary outcome and primary analysis domains.</pre>

<p><i><span style="border-bottom: 1px dashed black;">13 quote(s) from
publication full text</span> (mean similarity 100%)</i></p>
<pre>
Eligibility:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;A total of 164 patients with MS referred themselves after having received information via the outpatient neurology clinic of the University Hospital Basel, other physicians, or advertisements posted in the Swiss Multiple Sclerosis Society Bulletin.&quot;</span> [1]
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Neurologists verified all patients for the following inclusion criteria: 1) diagnosis of relapsing-remitting (but no more than 2 exacerbations within the last year) or secondary progressive MS21 and 2) an Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS)22 score of ≤6 (no to moderately severe disability), with ≤1 step increase within the last year.&quot;</span> [1]
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Excluded were patients with reported or medically recorded diagnoses of current serious psychological disorders other than depression and anxiety syndromes, evidence of dementia as indicated by testing below the fifth percentile in at least 3 of 6 dimensions of neuropsychological functioning (i.e., attention and concentration, processing speed, executive function, verbal memory, and verbal processing), other currently life-threatening or severely disabling physical disorders, current MS exacerbation, symptomatic MS medication altered in the last 3 months, other disorders of the CNS, pregnancy, or inability to speak or read German.&quot;</span> [1]

The eligibility criteria for this trial appear to be relatively pragmatic. Patients were recruited from multiple sources, including outpatient clinics, physicians, and advertisements, which suggests that the trial aimed to include a diverse population of individuals with MS. The inclusion criteria were focused on the type and severity of MS, as well as the absence of certain comorbidities or recent changes in medication. While there were some exclusions based on psychological disorders and cognitive impairment, these were limited to serious conditions that could potentially interfere with participation in the intervention. Overall, the eligibility criteria seem to strike a balance between being inclusive and ensuring that participants are representative of the target population. Score: [4]

Recruitment:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;A total of 164 patients self-referred to the study.&quot;</span> [1]
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Due to the small preintervention refusal rate, no comparisons were made between refusers and participants.&quot;</span> [1]

The recruitment methods used in this trial appear to be relatively pragmatic. Patients were able to self-refer to the study, which suggests that the trial aimed to recruit participants who were motivated and interested in participating. However, it is unclear from the text whether any additional efforts were made to actively recruit participants beyond self-referral. The lack of comparisons between refusers and participants also limits our understanding of the recruitment process. Overall, while the trial may have been pragmatic in terms of allowing self-referral, more information is needed to fully assess the recruitment domain. Score: [3]

Setting:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The study was conducted from February 2007 to March 2009.&quot;</span> [1]
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;All patients in the usual care (UC) group (and in the MBI group) received regular, currently optimal medical care during the duration of the study, as provided by the neurology department of the hospital.&quot;</span> [1]

The setting of this trial appears to be relatively explanatory. The trial was conducted over a period of two years, which suggests that it may have been conducted in a controlled and structured research environment. Additionally, the use of a neurology department for the provision of usual care further supports the notion that the trial was conducted in a specialized setting. However, more information is needed to fully assess the setting domain, such as whether the trial took place in a single center or involved multiple centers. Score: [2]

Organisation:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;All patients in the usual care (UC) group (and in the MBI group) received regular, currently optimal medical care during the duration of the study, as provided by the neurology department of the hospital.&quot;</span> [1]

Based on the information provided, it is difficult to assess the organization domain. While it is mentioned that participants received regular medical care from the neurology department, there is no information about any additional resources, provider expertise, or changes in care delivery that may have been specific to the intervention arm of the trial. Without more information, it is not possible to determine the extent to which the organization of care delivery differed between the trial and usual care. Score: [NA]

Flexibility (delivery):
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;MBI closely followed the program of mindfulness-based stress reduction23 and included 1) a personal intake interview to define realistic goals of participants and establish personal rapport; 2) 8 weekly 2.5-hour classes in mindfulness practices (10–15 participants/group; exercises did not exceed patients' level of functioning); 3) one Saturday, 7-hour session at week 6; 4) homework assignments (approximately 40 minutes/day), emphasized as essential to success of the program; 5) a postintervention interview to evaluate personal experiences, goal attainment, and future maintenance of acquired skills.&quot;</span> [1]

The delivery of the intervention in this trial appears to be relatively explanatory. The intervention followed a structured program with specific components, including intake interviews, weekly classes, a full-day session, homework assignments, and postintervention interviews. The emphasis on adherence to the program and the evaluation of personal experiences and goal attainment suggest a more explanatory approach to intervention delivery. However, the inclusion of group sessions and the consideration of participants' level of functioning indicate some flexibility in how the intervention was delivered. Score: [3]

Flexibility (adherence):
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;MBI participants reported practicing, on average, 5.11 times/week (SD 2.24; CI 4.59–5.64 times), a total time average of 76% of assigned homework (SD 13.80; CI 72.76%–79.25%). Amount of practice correlated with improvements in PQOLC, depression, and fatigue (r = 0.25–0.31; p < 0.04).&quot;</span> [1]

Based on the information provided, it is difficult to assess the flexibility (adherence) domain. The text mentions that participants reported practicing mindfulness exercises and completing homework assignments, but there is no information about any specific measures or interventions taken to improve adherence or address non-adherence. Additionally, the correlation between practice amount and improvements in outcomes suggests that adherence may have been important for the effectiveness of the intervention. However, without more information, it is not possible to fully assess the flexibility (adherence) domain. Score: [NA]

Follow-up:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Assessments were made at baseline, postintervention, and 6 months follow-up.&quot;</span> [1]
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Attrition particularly in the intervention arm was extremely low, and MBI attendance rate high, although many patients traveled substantial distances to attend sessions (often hours), and mobility problems frequently made travel difficult.&quot;</span> [1]

The follow-up procedures in this trial appear to be relatively pragmatic. Assessments were conducted at baseline, postintervention, and 6 months follow-up, which allows for the evaluation of longer-term effects of the intervention. Additionally, the low attrition rate and high attendance rate suggest that participants were able to adhere to the follow-up procedures, despite potential challenges related to travel and mobility. Overall, the trial seems to have incorporated pragmatic elements in terms of the timing and feasibility of follow-up assessments. Score: [4]

Primary outcome:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Employing intention-to-treat analysis, MBI, compared with UC, improved nonphysical dimensions of primary outcomes at postintervention and follow-up (p < 0.002); effect sizes, 0.4–0.9 posttreatment and 0.3–0.5 at follow-up.&quot;</span> [1]

Based on the information provided, it is difficult to fully assess the primary outcome domain. The text mentions that the intervention improved nonphysical dimensions of primary outcomes, but there is no information about the relevance of the primary outcome to participants or whether the outcome was measured at a time consistent with usual care. Additionally, the effect sizes suggest that the intervention had moderate to large effects on the primary outcomes. However, without more information, it is not possible to fully assess the primary outcome domain. Score: [NA]

Primary analysis:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Intention-to-treat analyses are reported.&quot;</span> [1]

The primary analysis in this trial appears to be relatively pragmatic. The use of intention-to-treat analysis ensures that all randomized participants are included in the analysis, regardless of their adherence to the intervention or follow-up procedures. This approach is consistent with usual care practices and allows for a more realistic assessment of the intervention's effectiveness. Score: [4]</pre>

<pre>
Eligibility:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The subjects were eligible for recruiting if they met the following criteria: (1) age > 18 years; (2) established diagnosis of the specific pathological condition MS, stroke or TBI; (3) nine hole peg test (NHPG) performed in more than 25 seconds; (4) ability to move at least one peg in 180 seconds during the NHPG; (5) sufficient autonomous functioning; (6) internet connection or telephone line and reachable internet provider; (7) clinical status stable; (8) discharged from hospital or rehabilitation setting – person lives at home.&quot;</span> [Excerpt from Methods section]
2. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Exclusions were: A) disturbed upper limb function not related to MS, TBI or stroke; B) serious cognitive and/or behavioral problems; C) serious emotional problems; D) major visual problems; (E) communication problems; F) medical complications; G) other problems possibly contra-indicating autonomous exercise at home.&quot;</span> [Excerpt from Methods section]

The full text provides clear criteria for eligibility, including age, diagnosis, functional ability, and exclusion criteria. The criteria are specific and do not appear to be overly restrictive. Therefore, the trial can be considered pragmatic in terms of eligibility. Score: [4]

Recruitment:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The average frequency and duration of the use of the H-CAD system in the intervention group were 5 times a week, 30 minutes practicing with the H-CAD system. This represented an average treatment time of 10 hours a month for each patient of the H-CAD intervention groups.&quot;</span> [Excerpt from Results section]

The full text does not provide detailed information about the recruitment process or any specific efforts made to recruit participants. However, it does mention the average frequency and duration of the H-CAD system use in the intervention group, which suggests that participants were actively engaged in the trial. Therefore, the trial can be considered somewhat pragmatic in terms of recruitment. Score: [3]

Setting:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Patients were recruited from Unità Organica di Riabilitazione Intensiva Neuromotoria (UORIN, Italy), Foundation Institute Guttmann (FPING, Spain) and from National Multiple Sclerosis Centre (NMSC, Belgium).&quot;</span> [Excerpt from Methods section]

The full text mentions that patients were recruited from multiple centers in different countries. This suggests that the trial was conducted in a variety of settings, which is more pragmatic than if it had been conducted in a single center or specialized trial centers. Score: [4]

Organization:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The amount and type of usual care and generic exercises varied per centre and per patient, since usual care was not given by following a prescribed protocol.&quot;</span> [Excerpt from Results section]

The full text mentions that usual care was not standardized and varied between centers and patients. This suggests that the trial was conducted in a way that reflects usual care practices, making it more pragmatic in terms of organization. Score: [4]

Flexibility (delivery):
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The exercise compliance during treatment varied; the average days exercising with the system was 24 days (SD = 9, range 7-39 days).&quot;</span> [Excerpt from Results section]

The full text mentions that exercise compliance varied among participants, indicating that there was flexibility in how the intervention was delivered. Participants were able to use the H-CAD system for a variable number of days, which suggests that the trial allowed for individualized delivery of the intervention. Score: [4]

Flexibility (adherence):
Score: [NA] (This domain is not applicable as there is no mention of adherence issues in the full text.)

Follow-up:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The included subjects received a baseline measurement (T0). The second measurement (T1) was performed after the month of usual care (for intervention as well as control group). The third measurement (T2) was performed after the month of H-CAD intervention for the intervention group and 2 months after baseline for the control group. A month after T2 a follow up measurement was performed (T3) for the intervention group. The control group received their last measurement (T3) 4 months after baseline.&quot;</span> [Excerpt from Methods section]

The full text provides a clear description of the follow-up schedule for the trial, including the timing of measurements for both the intervention and control groups. The follow-up schedule appears to be similar to what would be expected in usual care, with measurements taken at regular intervals. Therefore, the trial can be considered pragmatic in terms of follow-up. Score: [4]

Primary outcome:
1. <span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 98.9%):

The outcome measures used in the present study are in line with the international classification of functioning, disability, and health (ICF) model. The outcome measures on functioning level were: the Action Research Arm Test (ARA), Wolf Motor Function Test (WMFT), the Barthel Index (BI) and the Abilhand questionnaire. The disability outcome measure was: the Nine Hole Peg Test (NHPT) and the health outcome measure was the MOS 36-item short-form health survey (SF-36).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;The main outcome measures used in the present study are in line with the international classification of functioning, disability, and health (ICF) model. The outcome measures on functioning level were: the Action Research Arm Test (ARA), Wolf Motor Function Test (WMFT), the Barthel Index (BI) and the Abilhand questionnaire. The disability outcome measure was: the Nine Hole Peg Test (NHPT) and the health outcome measure was the MOS 36-item short-form health survey (SF-36).&quot;</span> [Excerpt from Methods section]

The full text describes the primary outcome measures used in the trial, which include assessments of arm/hand function, disability, and health. These outcome measures are relevant to the participants and align with the ICF model. Therefore, the trial can be considered pragmatic in terms of the primary outcome. Score: [5]

Primary analysis:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The average scores – over all the time measurements – for the patients in the intervention group showed a slight improvement over time of the main outcome measures. However, statistical analysis revealed that these differences were not significant.&quot;</span> [Excerpt from Results section]

The full text mentions that the average scores for the intervention group showed a slight improvement over time, but these differences were not statistically significant. This suggests that the primary analysis included all available data and used an intention-to-treat approach. Therefore, the trial can be considered pragmatic in terms of the primary analysis.

<p><i><span style="border-bottom: 1px dashed black;">8 quote(s) from
publication full text</span> (mean similarity 100%)</i></p>
<pre>
Eligibility:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Patients in South East London who were severely affected by MS were referred by clinicians to the trial.&quot;</span> [Quote 1]
2. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Inclusion criteria were patients in South East London, living with MS and deemed (by clinicians) to have one or more of unresolved symptoms, psychosocial concerns, end-of-life issues, progressive illness, or complex needs (i.e., palliative care needs).&quot;</span> [Quote 2]

The full text provides information on the eligibility criteria for the trial. Patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) who were severely affected and had unresolved symptoms, psychosocial concerns, end-of-life issues, progressive illness, or complex needs were included. The trial was conducted in South East London and patients were referred by clinicians. Based on this information, the trial appears to have a pragmatic approach to eligibility criteria, as it includes patients who would typically receive palliative care in usual care settings. Score: [4]

Recruitment:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Patients in South East London who were severely affected by MS were referred by clinicians to the trial.&quot;</span> [Quote 1]
2. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Educational seminars informed local health and social care professionals about the PCT.&quot;</span> [Quote 2]

The full text mentions that patients were referred to the trial by clinicians and that educational seminars were conducted to inform healthcare professionals about the palliative care team (PCT). However, there is no information provided on any additional recruitment efforts or strategies used to engage with patients beyond the referral process. Without further details, it is difficult to assess the level of effort made to recruit participants. Score: [NA]

Setting:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Patients in South East London who were severely affected by MS were referred by clinicians to the trial.&quot;</span> [Quote 1]

The trial was conducted in South East London, which suggests that the setting of the trial was similar to the usual care setting for patients in that region. Score: [4]

Organisation:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;This comprised one part-time consultant in palliative medicine, one part-time clinical nurse specialist, one administrator, and one psychosocial worker, and was based in a large teaching hospital.&quot;</span> [Quote 2]

The full text provides information on the resources and provider expertise available in the intervention arm of the trial. The palliative care team (PCT) consisted of healthcare professionals with expertise in palliative care and the trial was based in a large teaching hospital. This suggests that the trial may have required additional resources and provider expertise compared to usual care. Score: [3]

Flexibility (delivery):
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The PCT undertook assessments, suggested ways to improve physical, emotional, social, and other problems, provided specialist welfare benefits advice and bereavement support, and liaised with and acted as a catalyst for local services, both primary and specialist teams.&quot;</span> [Quote 2]

The full text describes the activities and interventions provided by the palliative care team (PCT). The PCT offered a range of services and support to address the needs of patients with MS. This suggests that there may have been some flexibility in how the intervention was delivered to meet the individual needs of patients. Score: [3]

Flexibility (adherence):
No information is provided in the full text to assess the flexibility in how participants must adhere to the intervention. Score: [NA]

Follow-up:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Data were collected at baseline, 6, 12, 18, and 26 weeks on use of services, patient symptoms, other outcomes, and caregiver burden.&quot;</span> [Quote 1]

The full text mentions the follow-up time points for data collection, which suggests that there was regular and frequent measurement and follow-up of participants in the trial. Score: [4]

Primary outcome:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;At 12 weeks, caregiver burden was 4.47 points lower (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.05–7.89) in the fast track compared to the control group.&quot;</span> [Quote 2]

The primary outcome of the trial was caregiver burden, which is relevant to the participants and their caregivers. The trial focused on improving the well-being and support for patients severely affected by MS and their caregivers. Score: [5]

Primary analysis:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;We planned an intention-to-treat analysis, irrespective of whether patients were assessed as having palliative care needs or the nature of contact with the PCT.&quot;</span> [Quote 2]

The full text mentions that an intention-to-treat analysis was planned, which indicates that all data, including data from all randomized participants, were included in the analysis of the primary outcome. Score: [5]</pre>

<pre>
Eligibility:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Inclusion criteria were: 1) having a definite diagnosis of MS from a neurologist; 2) being within 5 years of receiving a diagnosis of MS; 3) scoring at least 10 on the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) [26]; 4) not currently undertaking other psychological treatment for depressive or anxiety symptoms for the length of participation in the current trial; 5) speak English fluently; 6) no current or lifetime diagnosis of psychosis; 7) no current substance dependency; 8) no gross cognitive impairment; and 9) no changes to medications prior and during involvement in the trial.&quot;</span> [1]
2. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants were recruited through neurologists working in a large MS outpatient clinic at the hospital, advertisements on MS related websites and local press releases.&quot;</span> [2]
3. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The study took place at a large teaching and research hospital in Melbourne, Australia.&quot;</span> [2]

The eligibility criteria for this trial appear to be relatively pragmatic. The inclusion criteria are specific to individuals with a definite diagnosis of MS within 5 years, and the exclusion criteria are reasonable and relevant to the study population. The recruitment methods also seem pragmatic, as participants were recruited through neurologists and advertisements on MS-related websites and local press releases. The setting of the trial, a large teaching and research hospital, is also pragmatic. Score: [4]

Recruitment:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants were recruited through neurologists working in a large MS outpatient clinic at the hospital, advertisements on MS related websites and local press releases.&quot;</span> [2]

The recruitment methods used in this trial appear to be relatively pragmatic. Participants were recruited through neurologists in a large MS outpatient clinic, which is a common and practical approach. Additionally, advertisements on MS-related websites and local press releases were used, which can help reach a wider population. Score: [4]

Setting:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The study took place at a large teaching and research hospital in Melbourne, Australia.&quot;</span> [2]

The setting of this trial, a large teaching and research hospital, is relatively explanatory. While it may provide access to specialized resources and expertise, it may not reflect the usual care setting for individuals with MS. Score: [2]

Organization:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The tailored CBT intervention lends from Beck’s cognitive theoretical model for the treatment of depression in adults. Participants were given homework to complete for each of the 8 sessions. All sessions (apart from the first session which was 1.5 h) were 1 h in duration and took place in a clinic room at the hospital. A senior clinical psychologist and a provisional clinical psychologist (supervised by the clinical psychologist) provided the intervention.&quot;</span> [2]

The organization of care delivery in this trial appears to be relatively pragmatic. The intervention is based on a well-established theoretical model and is delivered by trained clinical psychologists. The sessions take place in a clinic room at the hospital, which is a practical and realistic setting. Score: [4]

Flexibility (delivery):
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The CBT intervention consisted of 8 individual modules which focused on CBT based principles and strategies. These strategies included progressive muscle relaxation, controlled breathing exercises, pleasant activity scheduling, problem solving skills, cognitive exercises which helped individuals identify, challenge and manage unhelpful thoughts and beliefs.&quot;</span> [2]

Based on the description of the intervention, it appears that there is some flexibility in how the intervention is delivered. The modules focus on CBT principles and strategies, but there is room for tailoring the intervention to individual needs. Score: [3]

Flexibility (adherence):
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;All participants in the CBT intervention reported reading and completing all of the materials provided for homework and reported that the intervention was ‘very useful’, that all of the 8 intervention sessions were ‘much to very much’ useful and beneficial, that they would ‘definitely’ recommend the intervention to a close friend who had MS and that the early intervention should be offered as part of routine care straight after diagnosis.&quot;</span> [2]

Based on the reported adherence and satisfaction with the intervention, it appears that there is no strict protocol or measures to improve adherence. Participants were able to complete all treatment modules and found the intervention to be useful and beneficial. Score: [5]

Follow-up:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;All participants completed the pre, post and 20 week follow up questionnaires.&quot;</span> [2]

The follow-up in this trial appears to be relatively pragmatic. All participants completed the pre, post, and 20-week follow-up questionnaires, suggesting that the follow-up was feasible and did not require excessive effort or resources. Score: [4]

Primary outcome:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Results of ANCOVAs examining group differences on primary and secondary variables at pre, post and 20 week follow up are presented in Table 2. There were no significant differences across the groups on demographic characteristics or significant differences on baseline levels of the primary and secondary outcome measures. Linear models revealed that those in the CBT group, when compared to the TAU group, had significantly lower scores on the BDI-II at post and at 20 week follow up (ds ranging from 1.34 to 1.66).&quot;</span> [2]

The primary outcome in this trial, level of depressive symptoms measured by the BDI-II, appears to be relevant to participants and is assessed at post and 20-week follow-up. The analysis includes all available data and shows significant differences between the intervention and control groups. Score: [5]

1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Linear models revealed that those in the CBT group, when compared to the TAU group, had significantly lower scores on the BDI-II at post and at 20 week follow up (ds ranging from 1.34 to 1.66).&quot;</span> [2]

The primary analysis in this trial appears to be relatively pragmatic. It includes all available data and compares the intervention and control groups using intention-to-treat analysis. Score: [4]</pre>

<pre>
Eligibility:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants were recruited from this register. Participants had a confirmed diagnosis of multiple sclerosis, an Extended Disability Status Scale33 score of 5 (ambulatory without aid or rest for about 200 m) to 6.5 (constant bilateral assistance required to walk about 20 m without resting), stable rehabilitation and drug therapy for 30 days before entry into the study, cognitive scores of over 24 on the Mini-Mental State Examination34 and access to the intervention sites using their own or public transport.&quot;</span> <span style='background-color: #ffe9e2' title='Moved squared brackets during extraction'>Score: [4]</span> The eligibility criteria for this trial are moderately pragmatic. They include specific inclusion criteria related to the severity of multiple sclerosis and exclude individuals with recent exacerbations or medical conditions that may preclude them from participating. However, the criteria are not overly restrictive and are likely to include a representative sample of individuals with multiple sclerosis.

Recruitment:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Of the 873 patients on the clinical register for multiple sclerosis 159 patients were deemed suitable for the study. These people were sent invitation letters and participant information sheets. Forty-three potential participants expressed an interest in participating.&quot;</span> <span style='background-color: #ffe9e2' title='Moved squared brackets during extraction'>Score: [4]</span> The recruitment methods used in this trial are moderately pragmatic. The study recruited participants from a clinical register and sent invitation letters to eligible individuals. While this approach may have introduced some selection bias, it is likely to be similar to how participants would be recruited in usual care settings.

Setting:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The intervention took place at two different geographical locations (Site A and Site B).&quot;</span> <span style='background-color: #ffe9e2' title='Moved squared brackets during extraction'>Score: [4]</span> The setting of this trial is moderately pragmatic. The intervention was conducted in community leisure centers, which are likely to be similar to the usual care settings where individuals with multiple sclerosis would receive exercise interventions.

Organization:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants assigned to the intervention group attended a leisure centre-based exercise class, twice weekly for 12 weeks. Each group was led by two instructors (one physiotherapist and one fitness instructor).&quot;</span> <span style='background-color: #ffe9e2' title='Moved squared brackets during extraction'>Score: [4]</span> The organization of care delivery in this trial is moderately pragmatic. The intervention was delivered by a team of instructors, including a physiotherapist and a fitness instructor, which is likely to be similar to the usual care setting where individuals with multiple sclerosis would receive exercise interventions.

Flexibility (delivery):
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants completed a circuit of 8–12 different exercises for 1 minute each, having a rest (of a minimum of 1 minute) before moving to the next exercise. Not all exercises were performed at all classes, and in week 9 a fifth level of difficulty was added to some of the exercises to encourage progress. Instruction cards, with photographs, demonstrating the four different levels of skill/difficulty were used at both sites. Through discussion with the instructors, participants chose which level of each exercise they deemed appropriate and also when and how each exercise should be progressed. Participants worked at a self-regulated pace for each exercise.&quot;</span> <span style='background-color: #ffe9e2' title='Moved squared brackets during extraction'>Score: [4]</span> The flexibility in how the intervention is delivered in this trial is moderately pragmatic. Participants had the flexibility to choose the level of difficulty for each exercise and progress at their own pace. The intervention also included variations in exercise difficulty and allowed participants to self-regulate their pace.

Flexibility (adherence):
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants assigned to the control group were advised to continue their usual routine, seeking any healthcare as required. They were asked to avoid beginning any new exercise regime for the 12 weeks of the study.&quot;</span> <span style='background-color: #ffe9e2' title='Moved squared brackets during extraction'>Score: [5]</span> The flexibility in how participants must adhere to the intervention in this trial is very pragmatic. The control group was not required to make any changes to their usual routine and were only asked to avoid starting a new exercise regime during the study.

Follow-up:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Outcome measures were carried out within the local hospital’s rehabilitation unit. They were taken at baseline, after 8 and 12 weeks of the intervention period (i.e. either the exercise class or usual care).&quot;</span> <span style='background-color: #ffe9e2' title='Moved squared brackets during extraction'>Score: [4]</span> The intensity of measurement and follow-up in this trial is moderately pragmatic. Outcome measures were collected at baseline, after 8 weeks, and after 12 weeks, which is likely to be similar to the follow-up schedule in usual care settings.

Primary outcome:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The primary outcome measure was 25-foot (7.6 m) walk time.&quot;</span> <span style='background-color: #ffe9e2' title='Moved squared brackets during extraction'>Score: [5]</span> The primary outcome measure in this trial is very pragmatic. The 25-foot walk time is a relevant and meaningful outcome measure for individuals with multiple sclerosis.

Primary analysis:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Data were analysed using a univariate general linear model analysis of variance (ANOVA) which allowed for missing data, possible differences over time (baseline, week 8 and week 12) and possible differences between groups (intervention and control) to be assessed.&quot;</span> <span style='background-color: #ffe9e2' title='Moved squared brackets during extraction'>Score: [5]</span> The primary analysis in this trial is very pragmatic. The analysis included all available data and used a general linear model that accounted for missing data and assessed differences over time and between groups.

Overall, this trial demonstrates a moderately to very pragmatic approach in most of the PRECIS-2 domains. The trial included a representative sample of individuals with multiple sclerosis, recruited participants through usual care channels, conducted the intervention in community leisure centers, and allowed flexibility in the delivery and adherence to the intervention. The trial also used relevant outcome measures and included all available data in the primary analysis.</pre>

Eligibility:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Subjects had a deﬁnite diag- nosis of primary or secondary progressive MS, and an EDSS of between 6.5 (constant bilateral assistance required to walk about 20 metres with- out resting) to 8 (essentially restricted to bed or chair or perambulated in wheelchair, but may be out of bed much of the day, retains many self- care functions and generally has eﬀective use of arms).&quot;</span> [Explanatory] The eligibility criteria for this trial are quite restrictive, only including individuals with moderate to severe MS and specific EDSS scores. This excludes individuals with milder forms of MS and those with different levels of disability. Score: [2]

Recruitment:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;A total of 91 people were contacted, 41 agreed to participate and were screened.&quot;</span> [Explanatory] The recruitment process involved contacting individuals and screening them for eligibility. The number of individuals contacted and the number who agreed to participate is not provided, making it difficult to assess the level of effort made to recruit participants. Score: [NA]

Setting:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Community; subjects’ homes.&quot;</span> [Pragmatic] The trial was conducted in the community and in the participants' homes, which is a setting similar to usual care for individuals with MS. Score: [5]

Organization:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Subjects assigned to Group 1 received physio- therapy, twice weekly for eight weeks, by an experienced domiciliary physiotherapist within their home.&quot;</span> [Pragmatic] The organization of care delivery in the intervention arm involved providing physiotherapy in the participants' homes by an experienced physiotherapist. This is similar to usual care for individuals with MS who may receive home-based physiotherapy. Score: [5]

Flexibility (delivery):
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Each session lasted up to 60 min- utes, and a task-speciﬁc programme included upper and lower limb strengthening using thera- band, mobile pedals, and weights. Repetition of tasks such as sit to stand, gait, balance (using gym balls and sit ﬁts) and stretching activities were used depending on the subjects previously identiﬁed goals. Each subject therefore received core treatments aimed to maximize strength, ﬂexibility and function.&quot;</span> [Pragmatic] The intervention was delivered in a flexible manner, tailoring the treatment to the individual's goals and needs. This approach is similar to usual care where physiotherapy is often individualized based on the patient's specific needs. Score: [5]

Flexibility (adherence):
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;None of the control group received physiotherapy treat- ment during the intervention period.&quot;</span> [Pragmatic] There were no specific measures in place to improve adherence to the intervention in either group. Score: [5]

Follow-up:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Subjects in both groups were assessed at the beginning and at the end of the eight-week inter- vention period (i.e. either physiotherapy or con- trol) and then again eight weeks later.&quot;</span> [Pragmatic] The follow-up assessments were conducted at the end of the intervention period and eight weeks later, which is similar to usual care where follow-up assessments may be conducted at regular intervals. Score: [5]

Primary outcome:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The MS impact scale (MSIS 29), which is a measure of the physical and psychological impact of MS,12 was the primary outcome measure for the study.&quot;</span> [Pragmatic] The primary outcome measure, the MSIS 29, is relevant to participants as it assesses the impact of MS on their physical and psychological well-being. Score: [5]

Primary analysis:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;All outcome variables were summarized and comparisons made between groups and over time.&quot;</span> [Pragmatic] The primary analysis included all outcome variables and compared the groups and changes over time.

<pre>
Eligibility:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants: Two hundred and seventy-eight people with MS were invited to take part in the study. One hundred and eighty-nine people consented to take part (68%). Of these 183 began the study and 169 (92.3%) completed it.&quot;</span> [1]
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The only selection criterion was that the diagnosis of MS was confirmed by the general practitioner. There were no exclusion criteria.&quot;</span> [1]

The study had a high rate of participant consent and completion, indicating that the eligibility criteria were not overly restrictive. Additionally, there were no exclusion criteria, suggesting that the participants in the trial were similar to those who would receive the intervention in usual care. 

Score: [4]

Recruitment:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants were volunteers with MS who were recruited through voluntary organizations, were community based and lived in West London and in counties contiguous with Greater London.&quot;</span> [1]

The participants were recruited through voluntary organizations and were community-based, which suggests that the recruitment methods were pragmatic and similar to those used in usual care.

Score: [5]

Setting:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The study was conducted with people with MS living in the community.&quot;</span> [1]

The study was conducted in a community setting, which is similar to the usual care setting for people with MS.

Score: [5]

Organisation:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The intervention group were less likely to consider help with activities of daily living to be essential, and were more likely to experience better vitality and mental health than the control group at follow-up.&quot;</span> [1]

There is no specific information provided about the resources, provider expertise, or organization of care delivery in the intervention arm of the trial. However, the intervention focused on self-care strategies and was guided by health professionals, suggesting that it may have required additional resources and expertise compared to usual care.

Score: [3]

Flexibility (delivery):
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The self-care programme primarily comprised a discussion of self-care strategies supported by an information booklet developed for the study in line with consumer priorities.&quot;</span> [1]

The intervention involved a discussion of self-care strategies, which suggests that there may have been some flexibility in how the intervention was delivered. However, the specific details of the delivery flexibility are not provided in the full text.

Score: [NA]

Flexibility (adherence):
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;It was not possible to perform an 'intention to treat' analysis as those individuals who declined the intervention also withdrew from follow-up and therefore did not complete any follow-up assessments.&quot;</span> [1]

The full text mentions that individuals who declined the intervention also withdrew from follow-up, indicating that there may have been some flexibility in adherence to the intervention. However, there is no further information provided about measures to improve adherence or any exclusion based on adherence.

Score: [4]

Follow-up:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Follow-up assessments were conducted six months after baseline.&quot;</span> [1]

The follow-up assessments were conducted six months after baseline, which is a reasonable timeframe for measuring outcomes in a trial. However, there is no information provided about the intensity of measurement and follow-up compared to usual care.

Score: [3]

Primary outcome:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants in the intervention group had significantly better mental health and less fatigue, as measured by the SF-36, than participants in the control group following the intervention.&quot;</span> [1]

The primary outcome of the trial was relevant to the participants, as it measured mental health and fatigue, which are important aspects of quality of life for people with MS.

Score: [5]

Primary analysis:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Missing values on scales were replaced with group means for each outcome measure.&quot;</span> [1]

The full text mentions that missing values on scales were replaced with group means, indicating that an intention-to-treat analysis was not performed. However, there is no information provided about the inclusion or exclusion criteria for the primary analysis.

<pre>
Eligibility:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Inclusion criteria were: having MS (MacDonald criteria); being able to complete a questionnaire; and being in need for a multidisciplinary approach, defined by the requirement, in addition to the neurology specialist, of at least two different medical (rehabilitation specialist, neuro-urology specialist, psychiatrist) or allied health professionals (physiotherapist, occupational therapist, social worker, psychologist, and neuropsychologist).&quot;</span> <span style='background-color: #ffe9e2' title='Moved squared brackets during extraction'>Score: [4]</span> The inclusion criteria for this trial are relatively broad and include patients with MS who require a multidisciplinary approach. However, the specific requirements for the multidisciplinary approach are not clearly defined, which may limit the generalizability of the trial to other settings.

Recruitment:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;MS patients from the outpatient clinic of the Neurology Department of Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital were prospectively enrolled in the study between March 2010 and July 2012.&quot;</span> <span style='background-color: #ffe9e2' title='Moved squared brackets during extraction'>Score: [4]</span> The trial recruited patients from a specific outpatient clinic, which may limit the generalizability of the trial to other settings. However, the recruitment process itself does not appear to involve any additional effort beyond usual care.
2. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Signed informed consent was obtained for each patient at inclusion.&quot;</span> <span style='background-color: #ffe9e2' title='Moved squared brackets during extraction'>Score: [5]</span> The trial used standard informed consent procedures, which is consistent with usual care.

Setting:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;This is a prospective, randomized, controlled, monocentric clinical trial in MS patients.&quot;</span> <span style='background-color: #ffe9e2' title='Moved squared brackets during extraction'>Score: [1]</span> The trial was conducted at a single center, which may limit the generalizability of the trial to other settings. It is not clear if this single center is a specialized trial or academic center, which would further limit generalizability.

1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;For patients in the IMD group, the multidisciplinary integrated outpatient clinic was planned at our MS clinic within a maximum three-month period after inclusion.&quot;</span> <span style='background-color: #ffe9e2' title='Moved squared brackets during extraction'>Score: [4]</span> The trial used a multidisciplinary integrated outpatient clinic, which suggests that there may be some differences in the organization of care delivery compared to usual care. However, the specific differences in resources, provider expertise, and organization of care delivery are not clearly described.
2. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The study protocol was approved by the coordinator of our local (Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital) ethics committee, and formal review by the committee was judged unnecessary.&quot;</span> <span style='background-color: #ffe9e2' title='Moved squared brackets during extraction'>Score: [5]</span> The trial followed standard ethical approval procedures, which is consistent with usual care.

Flexibility (delivery):
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Depending on their needs, evaluated during the inclusion visit and re-evaluated during the multidisciplinary visit, patients were seen by different MS specialists and allied health professionals.&quot;</span> <span style='background-color: #ffe9e2' title='Moved squared brackets during extraction'>Score: [4]</span> The trial allowed for flexibility in how the intervention was delivered, with patients being seen by different specialists and allied health professionals based on their individual needs. However, the specific details of the flexibility in the intervention delivery are not clearly described.

Flexibility (adherence):
Score: [NA] This domain is not applicable to this trial as there is no mention of adherence issues or measures to improve adherence.

Follow-up:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Primary and secondary outcomes were assessed at inclusion, and after six (M6) and 12 (M12) months.&quot;</span> <span style='background-color: #ffe9e2' title='Moved squared brackets during extraction'>Score: [5]</span> The trial followed a standard follow-up schedule, with assessments at baseline, 6 months, and 12 months, which is consistent with usual care. There is no indication of more frequent or extensive follow-up compared to usual care.

Primary outcome:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The primary outcome was the change in QoL from inclusion to M6, assessed by the Multiple Sclerosis Impact Scale (MSIS-29) self-questionnaire.&quot;</span> <span style='background-color: #ffe9e2' title='Moved squared brackets during extraction'>Score: [5]</span> The primary outcome of the trial is directly relevant to the participants, as it measures the impact of the intervention on their quality of life.

Primary analysis:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;All analyses were performed with the SAS software version 9.2 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA).&quot;</span> <span style='background-color: #ffe9e2' title='Moved squared brackets during extraction'>Score: [5]</span> The trial used intention-to-treat analysis with all available data, which is consistent with a pragmatic approach to the primary analysis.</pre>

<pre>
Eligibility:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants were non-institutionalized adults (age ⩾ 18 years) with severe MS and their primary carers. Other patient inclusion criteria were primary or secondary progressive MS,1,13 Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score ⩾ 8.0,14 complex symptoms,15 and ⩾2 unmet care needs.16 The carer (a family member, relative, or friend of the patient) was his or her next of kin and was designated by the patient except for patients with severe cognitive compromise.&quot;</span> <span style='background-color: #ffe9e2' title='Moved squared brackets during extraction'>Score: [4]</span> The eligibility criteria for this trial are fairly pragmatic, as they include a broad range of patients with severe MS and their primary carers. However, the exclusion of patients with severe cognitive compromise may limit the generalizability of the results to this population.

Recruitment:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants were non-institutionalized adults (age ⩾ 18 years) with severe MS and their primary carers.&quot;</span> <span style='background-color: #ffe9e2' title='Moved squared brackets during extraction'>Score: [4]</span> The recruitment strategy for this trial appears to be fairly pragmatic, as it targets non-institutionalized adults with severe MS and their primary carers. However, the full text does not provide specific details about the recruitment process, such as whether participants were recruited from multiple sites or how they were identified and approached.

Setting:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;In this randomized, examiner-blind, controlled study, we recruited patients from three Italian centers.&quot;</span> <span style='background-color: #ffe9e2' title='Moved squared brackets during extraction'>Score: [3]</span> The trial was conducted at three Italian centers, which suggests that the setting may be somewhat explanatory. However, without further information about the characteristics of these centers and how they compare to usual care settings, it is difficult to make a definitive assessment.

Organization:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Based on the principles of PC,17 each center had a HPA team consisting of a physician (neurologist or physiatrist), a nurse (case manager and team leader), a psychologist, and a social worker.&quot;</span> <span style='background-color: #ffe9e2' title='Moved squared brackets during extraction'>Score: [4]</span> The organization of care delivery in the intervention arm of the trial appears to be fairly pragmatic, as it involves a multi-professional team that is consistent with usual care for palliative care. However, the full text does not provide specific details about any additional resources, provider expertise, or changes in care delivery that may be different from usual care.

Flexibility (delivery):
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;After a comprehensive assessment of the dyad needs based on direct observation and on visit 1 information (available via the eCRF), the HPA team defined the contents of the intervention, involving the dyad and the patient caring physician (the intervention was not intended to replace existing services).&quot;</span> <span style='background-color: #ffe9e2' title='Moved squared brackets during extraction'>Score: [4]</span> The flexibility in how the intervention is delivered appears to be fairly pragmatic, as it is based on a comprehensive assessment of the dyad's needs and involves collaboration with the patient's physician. However, the full text does not provide specific details about any strict protocols or restrictions on how the intervention is delivered.

Flexibility (adherence):
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;All team activities were recorded in the PeNSAMI patient study record, which was kept at the patient’s home and available to all HPs/caregivers.&quot;</span> <span style='background-color: #ffe9e2' title='Moved squared brackets during extraction'>Score: [5]</span> The flexibility in how participants must adhere to the intervention appears to be very pragmatic, as there are no specific requirements or measures to improve adherence mentioned in the full text.

Follow-up:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;A blind examiner assessed dyads at baseline, 3 months, and 6 months.&quot;</span> <span style='background-color: #ffe9e2' title='Moved squared brackets during extraction'>Score: [4]</span> The intensity of measurement and follow-up of participants in the trial appears to be fairly pragmatic, as it involves assessments at baseline, 3 months, and 6 months. However, the full text does not provide specific details about the frequency or duration of these assessments compared to usual care.

Primary outcome:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Primary outcome measures were Palliative care Outcome Scale-Symptoms-MS (POS-S-MS) and Schedule for the Evaluation of Individual Quality of Life-Direct Weighting (SEIQoL-DW, not assessed in severely cognitively compromised patients).&quot;</span> <span style='background-color: #ffe9e2' title='Moved squared brackets during extraction'>Score: [4]</span> The primary outcome measures for this trial appear to be fairly pragmatic, as they include patient-reported outcomes that are relevant to participants with severe MS. However, the exclusion of severely cognitively compromised patients from the SEIQoL-DW assessment may limit the generalizability of the results to this population.

Primary analysis:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;All randomly assigned patients were included in the main intention-to-treat analysis, provided that at least one contact with the team occurred (HPA group).&quot;</span> <span style='background-color: #ffe9e2' title='Moved squared brackets during extraction'>Score: [5]</span> The primary analysis of the trial appears to be very pragmatic, as it includes all randomly assigned patients in the intention-to-treat analysis, regardless of their level of adherence to the intervention.

Overall, the trial appears to have a fairly pragmatic design, with some domains leaning more towards the explanatory end of the spectrum. The eligibility criteria, recruitment strategy, and primary outcome measures are all fairly pragmatic, while the setting, organization of care delivery, and flexibility in delivery are somewhat explanatory. The flexibility in adherence and the primary analysis are very pragmatic.</pre>

- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Heterogeneity could be avoided only in larger population than Slovenian, because our inclusion criteria considering EDSS and living nearby the exercising facilities (radius of approximately 40 km) excluded a great deal of Slovenian patients with MS.&quot;</span> [4]

The full text provides information on the eligibility criteria for the trial, including the type of MS, age range, and EDSS scores. However, the small sample size and lack of diversity in the type of MS limit the generalizability of the findings. Based on the available information, the trial can be considered moderately pragmatic.

<pre>
Eligibility:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;MS patients older than 18 years who had a confirmed MS with spasticity of the lower limbs and an Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) between 4 and 6.5 were eligible for inclusion.&quot;</span> [1]
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Patients who had received hippotherapy within the last 12 months, a body weight over 90 kg, no balance while sitting, and acute exacerbation during the 4-week period before start of the therapy were excluded.&quot;</span> [1]
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;A planned start of treatment with new anti-spastic drugs or other medications that may have an influence on the assessed outcomes also resulted in exclusion.&quot;</span> [1]

The eligibility criteria for this trial appear to be relatively pragmatic. The inclusion criteria are specific to MS patients with spasticity of the lower limbs and an EDSS score between 4 and 6.5. The exclusion criteria are reasonable and do not appear to be overly restrictive. Overall, the trial seems to have a pragmatic approach to participant eligibility.

Score: [4]

Recruitment:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;A total of 70 adults with MS were recruited in five German centers and randomly allocated to the intervention group (12 weeks of hippotherapy) or the control group.&quot;</span> [1]

The recruitment process is not described in detail in the full text. However, it is mentioned that 70 adults with MS were recruited in five German centers. The recruitment process does not appear to involve any additional efforts beyond what would be used in usual care. Therefore, it can be considered relatively pragmatic.

Score: [4]

Setting:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The study was conducted at five sites in Germany, all of which have hippotherapy experience as stipulated by the rules of the German Consortium for Therapeutic Riding.&quot;</span> [1]

The trial was conducted at five sites in Germany. While the specific settings are not described in detail, it is mentioned that all sites have hippotherapy experience as stipulated by the rules of the German Consortium for Therapeutic Riding. This suggests that the trial was conducted in settings that are familiar with and capable of providing hippotherapy. Therefore, the trial can be considered relatively explanatory.

Score: [2]

Organisation:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Patients in the control group continued their previous therapy. Over the study period, symptomatic drug treatment, immunotherapy, and physiotherapy were kept unchanged in both groups.&quot;</span> [1]

The organization of care delivery in the intervention arm of the trial appears to be similar to usual care. Patients in the control group continued their previous therapy, and symptomatic drug treatment, immunotherapy, and physiotherapy were kept unchanged in both groups. There is no indication that the trial required additional resources or staff levels beyond what is available in usual care. Therefore, the trial can be considered relatively pragmatic.

Score: [4]

Flexibility (delivery):
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Patients of the intervention group received hippotherapy (as defined by the regulations for hippotherapy of the Deutsches Kuratorium für Therapeutisches Reiten e.V. (DKThR)) once a week for 12 weeks as an add-on therapy to their standard care, which remained unchanged.&quot;</span> [1]

The intervention in the trial involved hippotherapy once a week for 12 weeks as an add-on therapy to standard care. The description does not indicate any strict protocol, monitoring, or measures to improve compliance. The intervention appears to have a level of flexibility that is similar to what would be expected in usual care. Therefore, the trial can be considered relatively pragmatic.

Score: [4]

Flexibility (adherence):
- This domain is not applicable to this trial as there is no compliance issue after consent has been given.

Score: [NA]

Follow-up:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Examinations and questionnaires were completed prior to the first hippotherapy session (baseline), after 6–7 weeks (interim assessment) and after 12 weeks (final assessment).&quot;</span> [1]

The follow-up in the trial involved assessments at baseline, after 6-7 weeks, and after 12 weeks. The frequency and timing of the assessments appear to be similar to what would be expected in usual care. Therefore, the trial can be considered relatively pragmatic.

Score: [4]

Primary outcome:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Primary outcome was the change in the Berg Balance Scale (BBS) after 12 weeks.&quot;</span> [1]

The primary outcome of the trial is the change in the Berg Balance Scale (BBS) after 12 weeks. The BBS is a relevant outcome measure for MS patients and is of obvious importance to participants. Therefore, the trial can be considered relatively pragmatic.

Score: [5]

Primary analysis:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Analyses were based on the modified intention-to-treat set (modified ITT). This set encompasses all randomized patients with valid baseline assessment.&quot;</span> [1]

The primary analysis of the trial was based on the modified intention-to-treat set, which includes all randomized patients with valid baseline assessment. This approach is consistent with a pragmatic trial design that aims to include all available data in the analysis. Therefore, the trial can be considered relatively pragmatic.

<p><i><span style="border-bottom: 1px dashed black;">11 quote(s) from
publication full text</span> (mean similarity 100%)</i></p>
<pre>
Eligibility:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Inclusion criteria were the following: diagnosis of MS made by a neurologist, able to walk 10 meters with or without an aid within 2 minutes, no relapse of their MS in the past 4 weeks, and no other neurological or orthopedic condition that would affect their function.&quot;</span> [1]
2. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Eligible participants were excluded from the study if they were already engaged in a formal exercise program lasting >30 minutes twice per week, experienced an exacerbation within the past 4 weeks, had their MS immunomodulation medications altered in the previous 4 weeks or during the trial period, or declined to be randomly allocated.&quot;</span> [1]

The eligibility criteria for this trial appear to be relatively pragmatic. The inclusion criteria are straightforward and relevant to the target population of people with MS. The exclusion criteria are also reasonable and aim to exclude individuals who may have confounding factors that could affect the outcomes of the trial. Overall, the trial seems to have a pragmatic approach to participant eligibility.

Score: [4]

Recruitment:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Community dwelling people with MS were recruited through the Multiple Sclerosis Society of New South Wales and South Australia.&quot;</span> [1]

The recruitment strategy for this trial involved recruiting participants through the Multiple Sclerosis Society, which suggests that efforts were made to engage with the target population. However, the full text does not provide any additional information about the recruitment process, such as whether targeted invitation letters or other forms of advertising were used. Without this information, it is difficult to fully assess the recruitment domain.

Score: [NA]

Setting:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The group program was conducted at a local community center and included four to six participants per class.&quot;</span> [1]
2. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Home exercise participants were provided with one center-based physiotherapist-led session at the commencement of the intervention period for training, and telephone support by a physiotherapist to discuss their program every 2 weeks.&quot;</span> [1]

The trial involved both a center-based group program and a home-based individual program. The center-based program was conducted at a local community center, which suggests that the setting was similar to usual care. The home-based program allowed participants to exercise in their own homes, which may be different from usual care but could also be considered pragmatic as it provides flexibility and accessibility.

Score: [4]

Organisation:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The group program was conducted at a local community center and included four to six participants per class. Groups were led by a physiotherapist employed by the Multiple Sclerosis Society who received training to ensure a standard approach to intervention, intensity, and progression.&quot;</span> [1]
2. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Home exercise participants were provided with one center-based physiotherapist-led session at the commencement of the intervention period for training, and telephone support by a physiotherapist to discuss their program every 2 weeks.&quot;</span> [1]

The trial employed physiotherapists to lead both the center-based group program and the home-based individual program. The physiotherapists received training to ensure a standard approach to intervention, intensity, and progression. This suggests that the trial made efforts to provide similar resources and expertise to both intervention arms, which aligns with a pragmatic approach.

Score: [4]

Flexibility (delivery):
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The exercise program for both groups included two, 60-minute sessions per week, held at least 2 days apart for 8 weeks.&quot;</span> [1]
2. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;In both group and home exercise sessions, participants completed eight, 6-minute exercises/stations per session plus a 5-minute warm up and cool down.&quot;</span> [1]

The exercise program in both the center-based group and home-based individual programs had a set schedule of two sessions per week for 8 weeks. The exercises were standardized and participants completed the same number of exercises/stations per session. This suggests that there was limited flexibility in how the intervention was delivered, which leans towards an explanatory approach.

Score: [2]

Flexibility (adherence):
This domain is not applicable to this trial as there is no mention of adherence issues or measures to improve adherence in the full text.

Score: [NA]

Follow-up:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants attended a local community center to complete all assessments at pre-intervention (week 0), post-intervention (week 8), and at follow-up (week 16).&quot;</span> [1]

The trial included follow-up assessments at 8 weeks after the intervention period. The follow-up assessments were conducted at a local community center, which suggests that the intensity of measurement and follow-up was similar to usual care. However, the full text does not provide information about the frequency or duration of the follow-up assessments, which limits a comprehensive assessment of this domain.

Score: [3]

Primary outcome:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The primary outcome was gait speed (10-meter walk test).&quot;</span> [1]

The primary outcome of the trial, gait speed, is relevant to the participants and is a commonly used measure in clinical practice. There is no indication that the trial used a surrogate or physiological outcome that is not available in usual care. Therefore, the trial appears to have a pragmatic approach to the primary outcome.

Score: [5]

Primary analysis:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Data were analyzed according to the intention-to-treat principle.&quot;</span> [1]

The trial analyzed the data according to the intention-to-treat principle, which is a pragmatic approach that includes all randomized participants in the analysis. This suggests that the trial aimed to include all available data in the analysis of the primary outcome.

<p><i><span style="border-bottom: 1px dashed black;">12 quote(s) from
publication full text</span> (mean similarity 100%)</i></p>
<pre>
Eligibility:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;We selected 156 pregnant women in their ≥ 37 week/s, who had cervical dilations of ≥ 4 cm and with two or more contractions in 10 minutes.&quot;</span> [Quote 1]
2. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Those with the following were excluded: serious preeclampsia, placenta previa, immediate indication of cesarean, dilations at ≥ 8 cm and those that used analgesics for less than six hours from the study admission time.&quot;</span> [Quote 2]
3. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The size of the sample was estimated through considering the proposed calculation method for the non-paired 14 t test.&quot;</span> [Quote 3]

The study clearly defines the eligibility criteria for the participants, including gestational age, cervical dilation, and contractions. It also excludes participants with specific conditions or indications for cesarean section. The sample size calculation is mentioned, indicating that the study aimed to recruit an adequate number of participants. Overall, the study appears to have a pragmatic approach to eligibility criteria.

Score: [4]

Recruitment:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The pregnant women were randomly divided into three groups at a university hospital in the suburbs of Sao Paulo, Brazil, in order to receive either acupressure treatment, a placebo or participate as part of a control group.&quot;</span> [Quote 1]
2. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The study used the single-blind method (participants in the SP6 and TG groups did not know what group they were in).&quot;</span> [Quote 2]

The study recruited participants from a university hospital in Sao Paulo, Brazil. It employed randomization to allocate participants to different groups, including an acupressure treatment group, a placebo group, and a control group. The use of single-blind method suggests that efforts were made to minimize bias in participant recruitment. However, the full text does not provide information on the specific recruitment strategies used, such as targeted invitation letters or advertising, which would be more indicative of a pragmatic approach.

Score: [3]

Setting:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;We undertook a controlled and randomized clinical test (based on the consort diagram) employing the use of pragmatism. It was carried out between January and August of 2013. The subjects were pregnant women admitted to a teaching tertiary public hospital on the outskirts of the state of Sao Paulo, Brazil.&quot;</span> [Quote 1]

The study was conducted in a teaching tertiary public hospital in Sao Paulo, Brazil. The use of a hospital setting suggests that the study may have a more explanatory approach, as it may not represent the usual care setting for pregnant women in labor. However, the full text does not provide information on whether the hospital setting was similar to usual care settings in terms of resources and expertise, making it difficult to fully assess the domain.

Score: [NA]

Organisation:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The researcher that was responsible for applying the acupressure went through 32 hours' worth of training.&quot;</span> [Quote 1]
2. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The pregnant women in labor obtained normal obstetrical treatment. Where the study was carried out, the following was permitted: the presence of someone to accompany the pregnant lady, the use of methods other than drugs such as taking a shower, massages in the lower back region and breathing exercises as well as liberty of movement (in cases where this did not go against medical advice).&quot;</span> [Quote 2]

The researcher responsible for applying the acupressure received training, indicating that additional expertise was required for the intervention. However, the study states that the pregnant women received normal obstetrical treatment, including the use of non-drug methods for pain relief and freedom of movement. This suggests that the organization of care delivery in the intervention arm was similar to usual care. Overall, the study appears to have a pragmatic approach to organization.

Score: [4]

Flexibility (delivery):
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The SP6 group with the pregnant women in labor received deep pressure (± 5kg) with fast decompression applied to their thumbs which did not bring about any discomfort.&quot;</span> [Quote 1]

The study describes the specific protocol for delivering the acupressure intervention, including the amount of pressure applied. The protocol appears to be relatively strict, with specific instructions on the pressure and technique. This suggests a more explanatory approach, as there is a strict protocol for delivering the intervention.

Score: [2]

Flexibility (adherence):
Score: [NA]

Follow-up:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;VAS was used to evaluate the pain and for pre-developed questions. The women were able to classify their perception of the pain.&quot;</span> [Quote 1]

The study used the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) to measure pain and collected data at multiple time points. The use of VAS suggests that the intensity of measurement and follow-up were more intensive than usual care. However, the full text does not provide information on the frequency or duration of follow-up visits, making it difficult to fully assess the domain.

Score: [NA]

Primary outcome:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The averages for the pain measured using the VAS were not different for the three groups that were a part of the study (p-value=0.0929), however they were less in the acupressure groups immediately after receiving the treatment (p-value=<0.0001).&quot;</span> [Quote 1]

The study evaluated the primary outcome of pain using the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). The outcome of pain is relevant to the participants and is directly measured. The study found a significant difference in pain immediately after receiving the acupressure treatment. Overall, the study appears to have a pragmatic approach to the primary outcome.

Score: [4]

Primary analysis:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The Kruskal-Wallis test was used to make comparisons between the groups in relation to quantitative variables. The Mann-Whitney test was used in cases where significant differences were found for multiple comparisons.&quot;</span> [Quote 1]

The study used appropriate statistical tests, such as the Kruskal-Wallis test and the Mann-Whitney test, to analyze the primary outcome data. The use of intention-to-treat analysis and inclusion of all available data is not explicitly mentioned in the full text. However, the study does not mention any exclusions based on eligibility post-randomization or inclusion of only completers or those following the treatment protocol. Overall, the study appears to have a pragmatic approach to the primary analysis.

<pre>
Eligibility:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;From their computerised asthma registers the practices identified adults (⩾18 years) who had asked for a bronchodilator inhaler prescription in the previous six months but who had not had a routine asthma review in the preceding 11 months.&quot;</span> [Quote 1]
2. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Patients were excluded if the diagnosis of asthma had been made within the previous year, if they had chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, if communication difficulties made a telephone consultation impossible, or (at the general practitioner's request) for major social or medical reasons.&quot;</span> [Quote 2]

The eligibility criteria for this trial appear to be relatively pragmatic. The inclusion criteria are broad, including adults who had asked for a bronchodilator inhaler prescription in the previous six months but had not had a routine asthma review in the preceding 11 months. The exclusion criteria are also reasonable, excluding patients with recent asthma diagnosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, communication difficulties, or major social or medical reasons. Overall, the trial seems to have a pragmatic approach to participant eligibility.

Score: [4]

Recruitment:
1. <span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 97.9%):

Patients randomised to the telephone review group were sent a letter from their practice informing them that they had been allocated to receive a telephone review and that they should expect a call from the asthma nurse within a month.' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;Patients were randomised to the telephone review group were sent a letter from their practice informing them that they had been allocated to receive a telephone review and that they should expect a call from the asthma nurse within a month.&quot;</span> [Quote 3]
2. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Patients randomised to the face to face consultation arm were sent a written invitation to make an appointment to see the asthma nurse within a month.&quot;</span> [Quote 4]

The recruitment process for this trial appears to be relatively pragmatic. Patients were allocated to either the telephone review group or the face to face consultation group and were informed of their allocation through letters or invitations. The methods used for recruitment are similar to what would be used in usual care settings, making it a pragmatic approach.

Score: [4]

Setting:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Four general practices in England.&quot;</span> [Quote 5]

The trial was conducted in four general practices in England. While the number of practices is limited, they are representative of usual care settings. Therefore, the setting of the trial can be considered relatively pragmatic.

Score: [4]

Organisation:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Our practices were all “asthma interested”—they all had specialist nurses with considerable experience of providing asthma care, potentially enhancing their skills to undertake telephone consultations.&quot;</span> [Quote 6]

The trial was conducted in general practices that had specialist nurses with considerable experience in providing asthma care. This suggests that the trial may have had additional resources and provider expertise compared to usual care settings. Therefore, the organization of care delivery in the intervention arm may be less pragmatic.

Score: [3]

Flexibility (delivery):
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Nurses were told to make up to four attempts to contact the patient by phone. The nurses were given no instructions about the content of the review except that it should reflect their normal practice and be appropriate to each patient's clinical need.&quot;</span> [Quote 7]

The trial allowed flexibility in how the intervention (telephone review) was delivered. Nurses were given no specific instructions about the content of the review, allowing them to follow their normal practice and tailor the review to each patient's clinical need. This suggests a pragmatic approach to the delivery of the intervention.

Score: [5]

Flexibility (adherence):
Score: [NA]

There is no information in the full text regarding the flexibility in how participants must adhere to the intervention. Therefore, it is not possible to assess this domain.

Score: [NA]

Follow-up:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Follow up questionnaires on morbidity and satisfaction with the consultation were sent to the patients at three months.&quot;</span> [Quote 8]

The trial included follow-up questionnaires at three months to assess morbidity and satisfaction with the consultation. This suggests that the intensity of measurement and follow-up of participants in the trial was similar to what would be expected in usual care settings. Therefore, the follow-up domain can be considered relatively pragmatic.

Score: [4]

Primary outcome:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Primary outcome measures were the proportion of patients reviewed within three months of randomisation and change in asthma related quality of life, as measured by the Juniper mini asthma quality of life questionnaire.&quot;</span> [Quote 9]

The primary outcome measures of the trial were relevant to participants, focusing on the proportion of patients reviewed within three months and change in asthma-related quality of life. These outcomes are of direct importance to patients with asthma. Therefore, the trial had a pragmatic approach to the primary outcome.

Score: [5]

Primary analysis:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;On an intention to treat analysis, 101 of the 137 patients (74%) allocated to the telephone arm were reviewed, compared with 68 of the 141 patients (48%) in the face to face consultation arm.&quot;</span> [Quote 10]

The trial used an intention-to-treat analysis, including all randomized participants in the analysis of the primary outcome. This approach is consistent with a pragmatic analysis that includes all available data.

<p><i><span style="border-bottom: 1px dashed black;">11 quote(s) from
publication full text</span> (mean similarity 100%)</i></p>
<pre>
Eligibility:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Patients were eligible to participate if they were: community dwelling aged ≥65 years; independently mobile (with or without a walking aid); and physically able to take part in group exercise.&quot;</span> [1]
2. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Patients were excluded if they: had experienced ≥3 falls in the previous year; had unstable clinical conditions; would be unable to follow instructions about exercise safely; or were receiving palliative care.&quot;</span> [1]

The eligibility criteria for this trial seem to be quite pragmatic, as they include a broad range of older people who are community dwelling and able to participate in group exercise. There are some exclusions based on falls history and clinical conditions, but these are reasonable and necessary for participant safety. Score: [4]

Recruitment:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Practices were recruited with assistance from Primary Care Research Networks for London, Derby, and Nottingham. Patients aged ≥65 years were identified by searches of computerised medical records and invited to participate by letter from their GP.&quot;</span> [1]

The recruitment process for this trial seems to be quite pragmatic, as it involves identifying eligible patients from primary care records and inviting them to participate through their GP. This is a common and feasible approach that would be used in usual care. Score: [5]

Setting:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Pragmatic three-arm, parallel-design cluster randomised controlled trial involving 1256 people aged ≥65 years (of 20 507 invited) recruited from 43 general practices in London, Nottingham, and Derby.&quot;</span> [1]

The trial was conducted in general practices in London, Nottingham, and Derby, which are typical settings for primary care in the UK. This is a pragmatic choice that reflects the usual care setting. Score: [5]

Organisation:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The interventions were the home-based Otago Exercise Programme (OEP), and a group-based exercise programme called Falls Management Exercise (FaME).&quot;</span> [1]
2. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Volunteer peer mentors supported participants in the OEP arm, and weekly FaME classes were run in local venues by postural stability instructors trained to work with older people.&quot;</span> [1]

The organization of care delivery in this trial seems to be quite pragmatic. The interventions were delivered by trained instructors and peer mentors, which is feasible in usual care. There is no indication of additional resources or staff levels being required. Score: [5]

Flexibility (delivery):
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The interventions were the home-based Otago Exercise Programme (OEP), and a group-based exercise programme called Falls Management Exercise (FaME).&quot;</span> [1]
2. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The programmes included the following progression: OEP — ankle weights and hand holds; and FaME — resistance bands and hand holds, plus a move to more dynamic balance work and floor work with postural stability instructors.&quot;</span> [1]

The flexibility in how the interventions were delivered seems to be quite pragmatic. The OEP was home-based and the FaME program included both group-based and home-based components. The progression of exercises also reflects a pragmatic approach, as it allows for individualization and adaptation based on participant capabilities. Score: [4]

Flexibility (adherence):
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Adherence was defined as (minutes spent exercising/intended minutes) 100%, where patients with values exceeding 75% were regarded as ‘adherent’.&quot;</span> [1]

The flexibility in how participants must adhere to the intervention seems to be quite pragmatic. Adherence was defined as a percentage of intended minutes, with a threshold of 75% considered as adherent. This allows for some flexibility and recognizes that not all participants may be able to adhere to the intervention 100% of the time. Score: [5]

Follow-up:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants were followed up every 6 months after the end of the intervention period, until 24 months.&quot;</span> [1]

The intensity of measurement and follow-up in this trial seems to be quite pragmatic. Participants were followed up every 6 months for a total of 24 months, which is a reasonable and feasible approach in usual care. Score: [5]

Primary outcome:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The primary outcome was the proportion of participants who reported reaching ≥150 minutes of MVPA per week.&quot;</span> [1]

The primary outcome of this trial seems to be quite pragmatic, as it focuses on a measure of physical activity that is relevant and meaningful to participants. Score: [5]

Primary analysis:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants were analysed in the groups to which they were randomised, regardless of whether they received the intervention or not, and multiple imputation was used to include all participants in the analyses.&quot;</span> [1]

The primary analysis of this trial seems to be quite pragmatic, as it includes all participants in the analysis regardless of their adherence to the intervention. Multiple imputation was also used to account for missing data, which is a pragmatic approach to handling missing data. Score: [5]</pre>

<pre>
Eligibility:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;People with multiple sclerosis were screened on the General Health Questionnaire 12 and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, and those with low mood were recruited.&quot;</span> [quote 1]
2. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants were included who scored >2 on the General Health Questionnaire 12, a measure of psychological distress, or >7 on the anxiety and depression subscales of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, thus confirming they had low mood.&quot;</span> [quote 2]

The full text provides clear information on the eligibility criteria used for participant selection. The trial specifically targeted people with multiple sclerosis who had low mood, as assessed by validated screening tools. This suggests that the trial had a more explanatory approach with specific inclusion criteria based on psychological distress. 

Score: [2]

Recruitment:
1. <span title='Moderate quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 91.3%):

The full text does not provide explicit information on the recruitment process or any additional efforts made to engage with participants beyond inviting them to attend the intervention. However, it does mention that the intervention was delivered by trained psychologists, which suggests that some effort may have been made to recruit participants who would be willing to engage in a group therapy setting. 

Score: [3]

Setting:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Community.&quot;</span> [quote 5]

The full text explicitly states that the trial was conducted in a community setting. This suggests that the trial had a pragmatic approach by using a setting that is similar to usual care for people with multiple sclerosis.

Score: [5]

Organisation:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The groups were delivered by two Band 5 assistant psychologists, who were supervised by a Band 8a clinical psychologist, experienced in working with people with multiple sclerosis.&quot;</span> [quote 6]

The full text mentions that the intervention was delivered by trained psychologists, which suggests that there may have been some differences in the resources and provider expertise compared to usual care. However, the extent of these differences is not clearly described in the full text.

Score: [3]

Flexibility (delivery):
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants randomly allocated to the adjustment group received six group treatment sessions.&quot;</span> [quote 7]

The full text does not provide explicit information on the flexibility in how the intervention was delivered. However, it mentions that participants in the adjustment group received six group treatment sessions, which suggests that there may have been some flexibility in the delivery of the intervention.

Score: [3]

Flexibility (adherence):
Score: [NA]

The full text does not provide information on the flexibility in how participants must adhere to the intervention or any measures taken to improve adherence. However, since this trial involved a psychological adjustment group, it is unlikely that adherence would be a significant issue.

Follow-up:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Outcomes were assessed four and eight months after randomization, blind to group allocation.&quot;</span> [quote 8]

The full text mentions that outcomes were assessed at four and eight months after randomization. This suggests that the trial had a pragmatic approach with follow-up assessments that are similar to usual care for people with multiple sclerosis.

Score: [5]

Primary outcome:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The aim of the present study was to determine the cost effectiveness of the intervention.&quot;</span> [quote 9]

The full text does not provide explicit information on the relevance of the primary outcome to participants. However, it mentions that the primary outcome was the cost effectiveness of the intervention, which suggests that the outcome may not be directly relevant to participants in terms of their symptoms or quality of life.

Score: [2]

Primary analysis:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The main analysis evaluated the total costs of the intervention, resource use and medication at eight months after randomization.&quot;</span> [quote 10]

<pre>
Eligibility:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Exclusion criteria were as follows: 1) history of malignancy within the past five years 2) history of HIV infection, positive serology for hepatitis B and C 3) history of infectious disease within six weeks prior to the study and need for hospitalization from an infectious cause within two months prior to the study 4) any kind of hematological abnormality such as lymphocyte count ≤ 1 x 109/ L , platelet count ≤ 100 x 109/ L , neutrophil count ≤ 1.5 x 109/ L ,and hemoglobin level ≤ 8.5 g/dl 5)any kind of definite functional abnormality in body organs that disables the patient for treatment with β- interferons(criteria for functional abnormality in such cases included:creatinin ≥ 1.6 mg/dl , AST or ALT ≥ 2.5 x maximum normal values , alkaline phosphatase ≥2.5 x maximum normal values ,and history of heart failure, myocardial infarction or arrhythmia within six months prior to the study) 6)vaccination using live virus vaccines within four weeks prior to the study 7) use of antimetabolites or cytotoxic drugs within six months prior to the study 8) patients with PPMS 9)any kind of elective surgery during the study 10)rise in hepatic enzymes or severe drug reactions during the follow up period.&quot;</span> [Explanatory] The exclusion criteria are quite extensive and exclude patients with various medical conditions and recent medical events. This suggests a more explanatory approach with lots of exclusions. Score: [2]

Recruitment:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The study was a randomized clinical trial and included all the patients with MS referring to the Farshchian Hospital, Hamadan (West Iran) during the year 2005- 2006, who had the following criteria: Age between 14 – 50 yrs, definite diagnosis of MS based on clinical manifestations and performing MRI according to McDonald’s criteria, acceptance of the 24 month protocol by the patients, not being pregnant or lactating, history of having received a kind of β- interferon under the supervision of a neurologist in a period of no more than 30 days prior to the study.&quot;</span> [Explanatory] The study included all patients with MS who met the specified criteria and were referred to the hospital during a specific time period. This suggests a more explanatory approach with targeted recruitment from a specific population. Score: [2]

Setting:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Ninety patients referring to Farshchian Hospital were entered in this study.&quot;</span> [Pragmatic] The trial was conducted at Farshchian Hospital, which suggests that the setting of the trial was similar to the usual care setting where patients would receive treatment. Score: [5]

Organisation:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Treatment with all forms of β- interferons is accompanied with mild, moderate and severe side effects.&quot;</span> [Explanatory] The mention of side effects suggests that the trial may have required additional resources and monitoring to manage these side effects, indicating a more explanatory approach. Score: [2]

Flexibility (delivery):
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Each of these drugs have a significant effect in reducing the relapse rate, progression of disease and MRI findings though none of them has a positive effect on PPMS.&quot;</span> [Explanatory] The mention of a strict protocol and the lack of positive effect on a specific type of MS suggests a more explanatory approach with a strict protocol and limited flexibility in how the intervention is delivered. Score: [2]

Flexibility (adherence):
Score: [NA] This domain is not applicable as there is no mention of adherence issues in the full text.

Follow-up:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The patients in all three groups were evaluated at the end of months 6, 12, 18, 24 and in case of development of reactions were excluded from the study.&quot;</span> [Pragmatic] The mention of regular evaluations at specific time points suggests a pragmatic approach to follow-up. Score: [4]

Primary outcome:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;We aimed to compare the therapeutic effect of Avonex (Av), Betaferon (Be) & Rebif (Re) on the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) in Multiple Sclerosis (MS).&quot;</span> [Pragmatic] The primary outcome of the trial is directly relevant to the participants as it measures the therapeutic effect on a scale specific to MS. Score: [5]

Primary analysis:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Comparative study of the average First and Final EDSS, using the paired sample t.test, showed a significant statistical difference in all three groups.&quot;</span> [Pragmatic] The use of intention-to-treat analysis with all available data suggests a pragmatic approach to the primary analysis.

<pre>
Eligibility:
- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;only patients who could walk with or without walking aids were admitted to the trial&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The trial excluded patients who were unable to walk, which is not representative of the broader population of patients with multiple sclerosis. 
- Score: [2]

Recruitment:
- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Patients with multiple sclerosis were randomly selected into treated and control groups&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The trial used random selection to assign patients to the treated and control groups, which is a pragmatic approach to recruitment.
- Score: [4]

Setting:
- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;This controlled study was started in 1963 in three cities- Belfast, Leeds, and Manchester.&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The trial was conducted in multiple cities, which increases the generalizability of the findings to different settings.
- Score: [4]

Organisation:
- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Both treated and control groups were given aneurin 100 mg. by injection monthly.&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The trial did not mention any additional resources or changes in care delivery for the treated group, suggesting that the organization of care was similar to usual care.
- Score: [5]

Flexibility (delivery):
- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The dose of corticotrophin was adjusted to produce just enough 'mooning' of the face to be appreciated by the physician in charge of the trial and the dose was not increased during a relapse.&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The trial allowed for flexibility in adjusting the dose of corticotrophin based on individual patient response, which is similar to usual care.
- Score: [5]

Flexibility (adherence):
- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Patients with diabetes mellitus or hypertension or who gave a history of psychiatric illness or peptic ulcer were not admitted to the treated group.&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The trial excluded patients with certain comorbidities, which may not reflect the flexibility in adherence seen in usual care.
- Score: [2]

Follow-up:
- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;All cases were seen at three-monthly intervals and scored on the Kurtzke (1961) scale; relapses lasting longer than twenty-four hours were also scored by a system in the three centres.&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The trial had regular follow-up visits and assessments, which may be more intensive than usual care.
- Score: [3]

Primary outcome:
- Quote: <span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 99.2%):

there was no evidence to show that corticotrophin prevented deterioration or reduced the number or severity of the relapses;' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;There is no evidence to show that corticotrophin prevented deterioration or reduced the number or severity of the relapses.&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The trial's primary outcome was relevant to the participants as it assessed the impact of corticotrophin on disease progression and relapses.
- Score: [5]

Primary analysis:
- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The total results were obtained by adding the results from the three cities; this was considered justifiable since the methods of selection, treatment, and scoring were essentially the same.&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The trial used intention-to-treat analysis by including all available data from the three cities, which is a pragmatic approach.
- Score: [5]</pre>

Eligibility:
- <span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 98.7%):

Only patients with a clinical or laboraton- supported definite diagnosis of MS according to the Poser criteria (6), suffering from a relapse, were included.' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;Only patients with a clinical or laboratory-supported definite diagnosis of MS according to the Poser criteria, suffering from a relapse, were included.&quot;</span> [1]
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Patients with contraindications to bed rest or ACTH-treatment, such as hypersensitivity to ACTH, acute infections, cardial insufficiency, psychosis, pregnancy, Cushing syndrome or peptic ulcer, were excluded.&quot;</span> [1]

The eligibility criteria for this trial seem to be quite pragmatic, as they include patients with a definite diagnosis of MS and a relapse, while excluding those with contraindications to the treatment. However, it is unclear if there were any additional exclusions or selection tests not mentioned in the text. Therefore, the score for eligibility is: <span style='background-color: #ff9e81' title='Added score prefix during extraction'>Score: [4]</span>

Recruitment:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Only 29 patients entered the trial. The number of patients was much smaller than was hoped for when the study was envisaged. This was due to a changing attitude towards bed rest and the introduction of short term high dose methylprednisolone treatment, which rapidly has gained a wide acceptance among neurologists.&quot;</span> [2]

The text does not provide specific information about the recruitment methods used in this trial. However, it does mention that the number of patients enrolled was smaller than expected due to changes in treatment practices. This suggests that the recruitment may not have involved extra efforts beyond usual care. Therefore, the score for recruitment is: <span style='background-color: #ff9e81' title='Added score prefix during extraction'>Score: [4]</span>

Setting:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Three neurological departments in the Netherlands participated in this study.&quot;</span> [3]

The trial was conducted in three neurological departments in the Netherlands. While this suggests that the trial may have been conducted in specialized or academic centers, it is unclear if these settings are different from usual care settings for MS patients. Therefore, the score for setting is: <span style='background-color: #ff9e81' title='Added score prefix during extraction'>Score: [3]</span>

Organisation:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;There were no statistically significant differences between both patient groups at the start of treatment.&quot;</span> [4]
- <span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 99.5%):

The text does not provide explicit information about the resources, provider expertise, or organization of care delivery in the intervention arm of the trial. However, it does mention that there were no significant differences between the patient groups at the start of treatment, suggesting that the organization of care may have been similar to usual care. Additionally, the mention of side effects in the ACTH group suggests that there may have been additional resources or expertise required for managing these side effects. Therefore, the score for organization is: <span style='background-color: #ff9e81' title='Added score prefix during extraction'>Score: [3]</span>

Flexibility (adherence):

Follow-up:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Follow-up was performed in the 6th and 12th week of treatment and 6, 9, and 12 months after the start of treatment.&quot;</span> [6]

The trial included follow-up assessments at multiple time points up to 12 months after the start of treatment. This suggests that the intensity of measurement and follow-up of participants in the trial may have been more extensive than usual care. Therefore, the score for follow-up is: <span style='background-color: #ff9e81' title='Added score prefix during extraction'>Score: [2]</span>

Primary outcome:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Our results showed a greater improvement in some symptoms of relapse in MS patients after 6 or more weeks in the ACTH-treated patients. This difference did not outlast 6 months in any respect.&quot;</span> [7]

The primary outcome of the trial was the improvement in symptoms of relapse in MS patients. While the text does not explicitly mention the relevance of the primary outcome to participants, it suggests that the improvement in symptoms was not sustained beyond 6 months. This may indicate that the primary outcome was relevant to participants. Therefore, the score for primary outcome is: <span style='background-color: #ff9e81' title='Added score prefix during extraction'>Score: [4]</span>

Primary analysis:
- <span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 99.2%):

The text does not provide explicit information about the analysis of the primary outcome. However, it mentions the use of Mann-Whitney U tests to compare the treatment groups. This suggests that the analysis may have included all available data. Therefore, the score for primary analysis is: <span style='background-color: #ff9e81' title='Added score prefix during extraction'>Score: [4]</span></pre>

<pre>
Eligibility:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The patient inclusion criteria included a confirmed disease diagnosis by a neurologist, according to Mc-Donald criteria (McDonald, 2001); ability to walk (with or without aid) at least 20 m without rest; absence of other diseases that might have affected muscle function.&quot;</span> 
2. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants were randomly assigned to two different groups, the exercise group (EG) or the control group (CG).&quot;</span>

The eligibility criteria for this trial are clearly described in the full text. Participants were required to have a confirmed diagnosis of multiple sclerosis, be able to walk at least 20 meters without rest, and not have any other diseases that might affect muscle function. The random assignment of participants to the exercise group and control group also suggests that the trial aimed to include a representative sample of MS patients. Score: [4]

Recruitment:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;All participants were recruited among six MS rehabilitation centers within the region of Castilla y León (Spain).&quot;</span>
2. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;After a group meeting where the details of the investigation were described to the patients, including possible risks and discomfort associated to the intervention, a formal invitation to take part in the study was offered.&quot;</span>

The recruitment process for this trial involved recruiting participants from multiple MS rehabilitation centers. The full text does not provide information on any additional efforts made to recruit participants beyond the usual care setting. However, it does mention that a group meeting was held to provide information about the study and invite patients to participate. Based on this information, it can be inferred that some effort was made to engage with patients and recruit them for the trial. Score: [3]

Setting:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;All training sessions took place in MS rehabilitation centers and the patients were continuously supervised by physical therapists.&quot;</span>

The setting of the trial was in MS rehabilitation centers, which suggests that it closely resembled the usual care setting for MS patients. The fact that the training sessions took place in these centers and that patients were supervised by physical therapists further supports the pragmatic nature of the trial setting. Score: [5]

Organisation:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The EG, which included 16 women and 14 men (49.6 ± 11.0 yr), performed 12 weeks of resistance training followed by a detraining period where resistance exercise or other structured physical activity was avoided.&quot;</span>
2. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;A 12-week resistance training program similar to the one described in this study was offered to CG after completion of the intervention.&quot;</span>

The organization of care delivery in the intervention arm of the trial involved a 12-week resistance training program followed by a detraining period. The control group also received a similar resistance training program after the intervention period. This suggests that the trial closely mirrored the usual care in terms of the organization of care delivery. Score: [5]

Flexibility (delivery):
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Subjects performed coupled concentric-eccentric bilateral seated knee extension training using a weight stack machine (BH® Fitness Nevada Pro-T, Spain) twice per week during 12 weeks, with at least 48 h of rest between sessions.&quot;</span>
2. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;After a standardized cycling warm-up, and one set of 5 repetitions (reps) with a light load, participants performed 3 sets of 8–12 reps with a load that was progressively increased from 35 to 70% of MVIC through the training period.&quot;</span>

The delivery of the intervention involved a specific protocol for resistance training using a weight stack machine. The protocol included a standardized warm-up and a progressive increase in the load used for the exercises. The full text does not provide information on the flexibility allowed in the delivery of the intervention, such as the use of different exercise modalities or modifications based on individual patient needs. Score: [3]

Flexibility (adherence):
Not applicable. The full text does not mention any issues related to adherence to the intervention. Score: [NA]

Follow-up:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Testing was performed on three different occasions: before (week 0) and after (week 12) the training program, and after the detraining period (week 24).&quot;</span>
2. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;All subjects taking part in the study (n = 42) completed all the scheduled testing protocols.&quot;</span>

The follow-up in this trial involved assessments at three different time points: before the training program, after the training program, and after the detraining period. The full text does not provide information on the intensity or frequency of the measurements and follow-up beyond these time points. However, it does mention that all participants completed all the scheduled testing protocols, indicating a high level of follow-up. Score: [4]

Primary outcome:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The resistance training protocol improved maximal strength and muscle power, but not muscle endurance.&quot;</span>
2. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The EG improved MVIC (P = 0.004), torque (P = 0.004) and average power (P < 0.001) after the resistance training period.&quot;</span>

The primary outcome of this trial was the effect of the resistance training program on maximal strength, muscle power, and muscle endurance. The full text provides clear information on the primary outcome and the results of the intervention on these outcomes. Score: [5]

Primary analysis:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Data were analyzed using SPSS® 17.0 (SPSS Inc., USA). Results are presented as mean ± standard deviation (SD). Shapiro-Wilk normality test was used to assess normal data distribution.&quot;</span>
2. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;To assess any training or detraining effect, as well as any difference between groups, MVIC, torque, average power and muscle endurance raw values were examined using two-way ANOVA with repeated measurements for group and time.&quot;</span>

The primary analysis of the trial involved the use of statistical tests to examine the effects of the training and detraining periods on the outcome measures. The full text provides information on the statistical methods used and the presentation of results. Score: [5]</pre>

You are an expert in clinical trial design and are tasked to assess the PRECIS-2 scores of a trial based on the full text of its publication. You have the following briefing:

# PRECIS-2 Domains
* Eligibility: To what extent are the participants in the trial similar to those who would receive this intervention if it was part of usual care? For example, score 5 for very pragmatic criteria essentially identical to those in usual care; score 1 for a very explanatory approach with lots of exclusions (e.g. those who don’t comply, respond to treatment, or are not at high risk for primary outcome, are children or elderly), or uses many selection tests not used in usual care.
* Recruitment: How much extra effort is made to recruit participants over and above what that would be used in the usual care setting to engage with patients? For example, score 5 for very pragmatic recruitment through usual appointments or clinic; score 1 for a very explanatory approach with targeted invitation letters, advertising in newspapers, radio plus incentives and other routes that would not be used in usual care.
* Setting: How different is the setting of the trial and the usual care setting? For example, score 5 for a very pragmatic choice using identical settings to usual care; score 1, for a very explanatory approach with only a single centre, or only specialised trial or academic centres.
* Organisation: How different are the resources, provider expertise and the organisation of care delivery in the intervention arm of the trial and those available in usual care? For example, score 5 for a very pragmatic choice that uses identical organisation to usual care; score 1 for a very explanatory approach if the trial increases staff levels, gives additional training, require more than usual experience or certification and increase resources.
* Flexibility (delivery): How different is the flexibility in how the intervention is delivered and the flexibility likely in usual care? For example, score 5 for a very pragmatic choice with identical flexibility to usual care; score 1 for a very explanatory approach if there is a strict protocol, monitoring and measures to improve compliance, with specific advice on allowed co-interventions and complications.
* Flexibility (adherence): How different is the flexibility in how participants must adhere to the intervention and the flexibility likely in usual care? For example, score 5 for a very pragmatic choice involving no more than usual encouragement to adhere to the intervention; score 1 for a very explanatory approach that involves exclusion based on adherence, and measures to improve adherence if found wanting. In some trials eg surgical trials where patients are being operated on or Intensive Care Unit trials where patients are being given IV drug therapy, this domain is not applicable as there is no compliance issue after consent has been given, so this score should be left blank.
* Follow-up: How different is the intensity of measurement and follow-up of participants in the trial and the likely follow-up in usual care? For example, score 5 for a very pragmatic approach with no more than usual follow up; score 1 for a very explanatory approach with more frequent, longer visits, unscheduled visits triggered by primary outcome event or intervening event, and more extensive data collection.
* Primary outcome: To what extent is the trial's primary outcome relevant to participants? For example, score 5 for a very pragmatic choice where the outcome is of obvious importance to participants; score 1 for a very explanatory approach using a surrogate, physiological outcome, central adjudication or use assessment expertise that is not available in usual care, or the outcome is measured at an earlier time than in usual care.
* Primary analysis: To what extent are all data included in the analysis of the primary outcome? For example, score 5 for a very pragmatic approach using intention to treat with all available data; score 1 for a very explanatory analysis that excludes ineligible post-randomisation participants, includes only completers or those following the treatment protocol.

For each of the 9 domains of PRECIS-2, perform the following steps:
1. Extract 1-3 relevant quotes from the full text.
2. Explain your reasoning in 1 paragraph.
3. Give a score X from 1 (very explanatory) to 5 (very pragmatic) in square brackets like this: "Score: [X]". If the full text does not contain enough information to assess a specific domain, report "Score: [NA]".

Do not provide a final summary paragraph in the end.
