- Response: [NA]

P24:
- Quote: ""Only a few trials were available for analysis. Heterogeneity was seen between studies, but the available trials were of high quality. The present study shows that both OP and LP are equally safe and effective procedures for the management of pyloric stenosis in children. However, there was a trend in LP toward shorter time-related outcomes.""
- Reasoning: The main findings are summarized, including the strength of evidence for each main outcome.
- Response: [Yes]

P25:
- Quote: ""The analyzed data confirmed that LP has a similar rate of complications, both perioperatively and postoperatively. However, the LP group seemed to have a slightly higher rate of incomplete pyloromyotomies requiring a repeat procedure, with 6 cases occurring out of a total of 137 infants (4.38%) compared to none in the OP group. This is in line with other published series which reported an incidence of inadequate pyloromyotomies of between 2% and 8%.""

P26. ""This meta-analysis has shown that the lowest complication rates for the TIP repair are when it is applied to primary distal hypospadias. Complication rates are higher for all variables when the TIP repair is used for primary proximal hypospadias... Documentation of follow-up duration was limited, making assessment of the impact of length of follow-up difficult... Geographical location had a noticeable effect on outcome, with all but one complication being lower in the North American than the other groups.""

P24:
- Quote: ""This systematic review highlights a notable lack of evidence with regard to treatment outcomes in hypospadias surgery. Despite being perhaps the most common pathology dealt within paediatric urology, the level of evidence on which current practice is based remains limited to level 4, i.e. cases series [1]. As there are no adequately case-matched studies or randomized controls, this review cannot improve on that level of recommendation.""
- Reasoning: The authors summarized the main findings including the strength of evidence for each main outcome; considered their relevance to key groups (e.g., healthcare providers, users, and policy makers).
- Response: [Yes]

P25:
- Quote: ""Although this review covered all the available literature since 1990, we were limited to just 27 papers that met our inclusion criteria. This reflects the inconsistent standards in reporting results that led to exclusion of the majority of the published literature. We were also limited in our review to those outcomes that were objective and consistently measurable, i.e. fistula rates. We were unable to look at more subjective but equally important outcomes such as cosmesis and long-term patient satisfaction.""
- Reasoning: The authors discussed limitations at the study and outcome level (e.g., risk of bias), and at the review level (e.g., incomplete retrieval of identified research, reporting bias).
- Response: [Yes]

P26:
- Quote: ""There is no clear consensus on the ideal method of repair for distal hypospadias. Both the Mathieu and TIP techniques have been shown to have low rates of postoperative complications. Comparison between series is difficult because of a lack of consistency in reporting complications and follow up. We advocate uniform standards for reporting outcomes of hypospadias.""

P3. Introduction / Rationale: Describe the rationale for the review in the context of what is already known.
- Relevant quote: ""Inguinal hernia repair is one of the most frequently performed pediatric surgical operations [1]. Open repair of an inguinal hernia has been accepted as the method of choice since it was first described more than 50 years ago due to its lower morbidity, good cosmesis, and lower rates of recurrence [2–4]. Several pediatric laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair techniques have been introduced over the last few years [5–15]. Some centers use laparoscopes routinely for inguinal hernia repair in children because of the belief that the laparoscopic repair is less painful to the patients, results in earlier recovery and better cosmesis [16, 17]. In addition, laparoscopic repair also allows contralateral patent process vaginalis (PPV)/hernias to be defined and repaired in the same operation [9]. Unresolved debate still exists regarding the benefit of using laparoscopy over conventional open inguinal hernia repair even among laparoscopic surgeons due to the concern about its higher recurrence rate [9]. The aim of this study was to assess any differences in complication rates and outcome following surgery for indirect inguinal hernia between infants and children treated using the open and laparoscopic techniques.

P24. Discussion / Summary of evidence: Summarize the main findings including the strength of evidence for each main outcome; consider their relevance to key groups (e.g., healthcare providers, users, and policy makers).
- Relevant quote: ""Our review examined the safety and efficacy of the laparoscopic approach in the management of inguinal hernias in infants and children. Ten comparative studies were reviewed. Although the data is limited, the laparoscopic approach was associated with a trend towards higher recurrence rate. A sensitivity analysis had shown a comparable recurrence rate among groups, where studies limited to infants, or girls, or addressing incarcerated hernia, or having a short follow-up period were excluded. This could be explained partially by refinements in techniques and by achieving the required learning curve in the recent included studies. A narrative review by Bharathi et al. [28] of 22 studies (3 comparative studies) have shown a recurrence rate ranging from 0 to 5% for the laparoscopic inguinal herniotomy, which is comparable with that for open repair. A recent case series by Parelkar et al. [29] have demonstrated technical modifications where they were able to bring down the recurrence rate from 2.9 to 0%. The operative time for unilateral cases was significantly longer for those who underwent minimal access surgery for inguinal hernia in children. The direction of this effect was consistent; however, the included studies were heterogeneous due to various reasons including technical, surgeon, patient, and institutional factors. In those who underwent bilateral repairs, there was a trend towards shorter operative time in favor of laparoscopic approach. The direction of this effect was consistent and homogenous among studies’ reported operative time for bilateral repairs [17, 19, 20, 22]. This temporal efficacy that has been observed for bilateral cases could be explained partially by avoiding additional access for the opposite side [23, 28].""
- Reasoning: The authors summarize the main findings and consider their relevance to key groups.
- Response: [Yes]

P25. Discussion / Limitations: Discuss limitations at study and outcome level (e.g., risk of bias), and at review-level (e.g., incomplete retrieval of identified research, reporting bias).
- Relevant quote: ""Despite numerous case series spanning over a decade of surgical practice, only two randomized controlled trials were identified, studying 172 infants and children. The conflicting data revealed by the two randomized controlled trials could be explained partially by the possibility of selection bias and by the presence of potential confounding factors including different operative techniques and lack of standardization of other received treatments [17, 21]. Although our review utilized a very comprehensive search strategy to minimize the effect of publication bias, only two randomized clinical trial was included. Therefore, our review is a summary of the existing evidence with limitation to the conclusions drawn from these data due to the quality of the included studies. To minimize the reviewer bias, all steps of this review were conducted independently by two review authors. Our review’s conclusions are hampered by the quality and the small sample size of the most included studies. The studies included were heterogeneous in study design, age and gender of enrolled infants, primary or recurrent hernia, simple or complicated hernias. However, due to the limited number of studies and enrolled children, a subgroup analysis was not feasible.""
- Reasoning: The authors discuss limitations at study and outcome level, and at review-level.
- Response: [Yes]

P26. Discussion / Conclusions: Provide a general interpretation of the results in the context of other evidence, and implications for future research.
- Relevant quote: ""We were unable to identify any clear benefit of laparoscopic inguinal herniotomy over the open approach. This review brings to light the paucity of existing good-quality evidence in this area. A large-scale randomized well-powered clinical trial comparing the two approaches should be conducted to guide our practice. We have justified the completion of this review, as it is our opinion that there is currently inadequate information on which to base a treatment decision.""

Koivusalo 2009 [21] This was a single center study. Infants and children between 4 months and 16 years of age were randomized for laparoscopic and open repair. The randomization procedure using closed envelopes was utilized but was not adequately described. Allocation concealment was apparently adequate. Outcome assessment was masked. It was not clear that the analysis was done on an intention to treat basis. Not all enrolled infants and children were accounted for in the final results for various reasons. Chan 2005 [17] This was a single center study. Infants and children between 3 months and 18 years of age were randomized for laparoscopic and open repair. The randomization procedure was not adequately described. Allocation concealment was apparently adequate. Outcome assessment was masked. Analysis was done on an intention to treat basis. All infants and children were accounted for in the final results. Tsai 2010 [20] This was nonrandomized clinical trial. Children with a mean age of 4.9 years underwent either open or minilaparoscopic herniorrhaphy. The choice between the two approaches was made according to the wish of child and/or parent. The selection process was adequate. The groups were comparable with regard to important baseline factors. Outcomes were obtained from medical record. The follow-up period was adequate and those lost to follow-up were excluded from the analysis. The study scored 8/9 on Newcastle-Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale.""

- Relevant quote: ""Data on 2,699 children were identified from 10 comparative studies. Laparoscopic techniques were associated with a trend towards higher recurrence rate (OR = 1.81; 95% CI 0.89–3.67; p = 0.10), longer operative time for unilateral repairs (WMD = 10.23; 95% CI 8.82–11.64; p \ 0.00001), and may be shorter operative time for bilateral repairs (WMD = -4.54; 95% CI -11.63 to 2.55; p = 0.21). There was a significant reduction in developing a contralateral metachronous inguinal hernia in the laparoscopic group (OR = 0.37; 95% CI 0.20–0.67; p = 0.001).""

- Relevant quote: ""A sensitivity analysis was conducted where studies limited to girls, and/or with a median follow-up less than 6 months, and/or addressing a complicated hernia, and/or limited to infants were excluded and the meta-analysis of the remaining 6 comparative studies had shown a comparable recurrence rate among the groups [OR = 0.87; 95% CI 0.34–2.23; p = 0.76] (Fig. 2b).""
- Reasoning: The authors give the results of additional analyses.
- Response: [Yes]

P24. Discussion / Summary of evidence: Summarize the main findings including the strength of evidence for each main outcome; consider their relevance to key groups (e.g., healthcare providers, users, and policy makers).
- Relevant quote: ""Our review examined the safety and efficacy of the laparoscopic approach in the management of inguinal hernias in infants and children. Ten comparative studies were reviewed. Although the data is limited, the laparoscopic approach was associated with a trend towards higher recurrence rate. A sensitivity analysis had shown a comparable recurrence rate among groups, where studies limited to infants, or girls, or addressing incarcerated hernia, or having a short follow-up period were excluded. This could be explained partially by refinements in techniques and by achieving the required learning curve in the recent included studies. A narrative review by Bharathi et al. [28] of 22 studies (3 comparative studies) have shown a recurrence rate ranging from 0 to 5% for the laparoscopic inguinal herniotomy, which is comparable with that for open repair. A recent case series by Parelkar et al. [29] have demonstrated technical modifications where they were able to bring down the recurrence rate from 2.9 to 0%. The operative time for unilateral cases was significantly longer for those who underwent minimal access surgery for inguinal hernia in children. The direction of this effect was consistent; however, the included studies were heterogeneous due to various reasons including technical, surgeon, patient, and institutional factors. In those who underwent bilateral repairs, there was a trend towards shorter operative time in favor of laparoscopic approach. The direction of this effect was consistent and homogenous among studies’ reported operative time for bilateral repairs [17, 19, 20, 22]. This temporal efficacy that has been observed for bilateral cases could be explained partially by avoiding additional access for the opposite side [23, 28].""
- Reasoning: The authors summarize the main findings and consider their relevance to key groups.
- Response: [Yes]

P25. Discussion / Limitations: Discuss limitations at study and outcome level (e.g., risk of bias), and at review-level (e.g., incomplete retrieval of identified research, reporting bias).
- Relevant quote: ""Despite numerous case series spanning over a decade of surgical practice, only two randomized controlled trials were identified, studying 172 infants and children. The conflicting data revealed by the two randomized controlled trials could be explained partially by the possibility of selection bias and by the presence of potential confounding factors including different operative techniques and lack of standardization of other received treatments [17, 21]. Although our review utilized a very comprehensive search strategy to minimize the effect of publication bias, only two randomized clinical trial was included. Therefore, our review is a summary of the existing evidence with limitation to the conclusions drawn from these data due to the quality of the included studies. To minimize the reviewer bias, all steps of this review were conducted independently by two review authors. Our review’s conclusions are hampered by the quality and the small sample size of the most included studies. The studies included were heterogeneous in study design, age and gender of enrolled infants, primary or recurrent hernia, simple or complicated hernias. However, due to the limited number of studies and enrolled children, a subgroup analysis was not feasible.""
- Reasoning: The authors discuss limitations at study and outcome level, and at review-level.
- Response: [Yes]

P26. Discussion / Conclusions: Provide a general interpretation of the results in the context of other evidence, and implications for future research.
- Relevant quote: ""We were unable to identify any clear benefit of laparoscopic inguinal herniotomy over the open approach. This review brings to light the paucity of existing good-quality evidence in this area. A large-scale randomized well-powered clinical trial comparing the two approaches should be conducted to guide our practice. We have justified the completion of this review, as it is our opinion that there is currently inadequate information on which to base a treatment decision.""

Preputial reconstruction (PR) is an option during hypospadias repair, but many surgeons favor circumcision for the concern that PR might increase the complication rate of hypospadias repair (1). PR might do so because it carries specific complications, namely, dehiscence of the reconstructed prepuce and secondary phimosis, but the concern also exists that it might jeopardize the urethroplasty thereby increasing the risk of fistula formation (1). Nevertheless, the range of reported rates of specific preputial complications after PR is wide, with rates being completely negligible in some series (2), and it is unclear whether the arguments concerning the association between PR and urethroplasty complications are based on evidence or merely theoretical.""

P3:
- Quote: ""Preputial asymmetry is one of the components of hypospadias. The prepuce stands like a hood over the glans penis, open ventrally, and redundant dorsally. Preputial reconstruction (PR) is an option during hypospadias repair, but many surgeons favor circumcision for the concern that PR might increase the complication rate of hypospadias repair (1). PR might do so because it carries specific complications, namely, dehiscence of the reconstructed prepuce and secondary phimosis, but the concern also exists that it might jeopardize the urethroplasty thereby increasing the risk of fistula formation (1). Nevertheless, the range of reported rates of specific preputial complications after PR is wide, with rates being completely negligible in some series (2), and it is unclear whether the arguments concerning the association between PR and urethroplasty complications are based on evidence or merely theoretical.""

A recent study examining population weighted USA Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS) data reported that for the period 2008–2010, the distribution of open pyeloplasty (OP), RAP and conventional laparoscopic pyeloplasty (LP) approaches for paediatric pyeloplasty was about 83.5%, 13.5% and 3%, respectively [2]. These data also indicated that adoption of RAP has surpassed that of the conventional laparoscopic technique (LP), and that RAP now comprises >80% of minimally invasive paediatric pyeloplasties [2].

1. ""Abstract: Purpose: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to compare the clinical outcomes between laparoscopic splenectomy and the traditional open splenectomy in children. Methods: Literature searches were conducted to identify studies having compared the laparoscopic splenectomy (LS) and open splenectomy (OS) for children. Parameters such as operative time, blood loss, length of postoperative stay, the removal of accessory spleens and postoperative complications including postoperative high fever, acute chest syndrome (ACS), and ileus were pooled and compared by meta-analysis. Results: Among the 922 pediatric participants included in the 10 studies, 508 had received LS and 414 OS. There were shorter length of hospital stays, less blood loss, and longer operative times with the LS approach compared with OS. However, no significant difference was found between LS and OS in the secondary outcome, such as the removal of accessory spleens or postoperative complications including postoperative high fever, ACS, and ileus. Conclusion: LS is a feasible, safe, and effective surgical procedure alternative to OS for pediatric patients. Compared with OS, LS has the advantage of shorter hospital stay and less blood loss. Besides, total postoperative complications may be slightly lower in LS. We conclude that LS should be considered an acceptable option for children.""

- Reasoning: The main findings are summarized, but the strength of evidence is not discussed.
- Response: [No]

P25:
- Quote: ""There are few prospective series, amounting to only 37 patients. Well-designed prospective comparative studies are lacking, major and minor postoperative complications are sometimes not properly defined, follow-up data are often deficient and when presented they are not homogenously described in the different studies. These make comparison a challenging task.""
- Reasoning: The limitations of the review are discussed.
- Response: [Yes]

P26:
- Quote: ""However there are some tendencies that undeniably draw attention. Importantly, there is little mortality regardless of the type of replacement. In contrast, morbidity is significant. In 470 patients, 93 early respiratory complications and 262 early gastrointestinal complications are reported. Reoperations (e.g., because of graft loss or anastomotic leaks) were necessary in 6% of patients.""
