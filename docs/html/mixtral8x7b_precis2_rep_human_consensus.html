1. Eligibility:
   - <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Patients with type 2 diabetes (n=264) selected by a self-administered questionnaire aimed at measuring emotional distress and diabetes-related reduced daily functioning.&quot;</span> [Page 2]
   - <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Patients with score DFT >4 and DS >3 were eligible for trial participation.&quot;</span> [Page 3]
   - <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The time interval between the researcher-driven self-administered screening questionnaire and the face-to-face nurse-led detection procedure in the consultation room needed to be as short as possible.&quot;</span> [Page 3]

2. The eligibility criteria for the trial are based on a self-administered questionnaire that measures emotional distress and diabetes-related reduced daily functioning. The trial participants were selected based on a cut-off score for the Daily Functioning Thermometer (DFT) and the Distress Screener (DS). The researcher-driven screening questionnaire and the face-to-face nurse-led detection procedure in the consultation room needed to be as close as possible to ensure the accuracy of the detection. This approach is more pragmatic than explanatory, as it aims to reflect the usual care setting where patients are screened for eligibility based on their symptoms and medical history. However, the use of a researcher-driven screening questionnaire and a face-to-face nurse-led detection procedure may introduce some level of bias and variability in the selection process.

   Score: [4]

3. Recruitment:
   - <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The enclosed self-administered questionnaire consisted of the screening instruments that intervention PNs would also apply for SMS in their routine practice.&quot;</span> [Page 2]
   - <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Patients were asked to return the completed questionnaire to the research centre and to give informed consent to be approached if they were found to be eligible for research follow-up measurements.&quot;</span> [Page 3]
   - <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Within a week after receiving the screening questionnaire at our research centre, eligible patients were sent an invitation letter together with an informed consent form for trial participation and the baseline measurement.&quot;</span> [Page 3]

4. The recruitment process for the trial involves sending a self-administered questionnaire to patients, which includes the same screening instruments used by the intervention PNs in their routine practice. Patients are asked to return the completed questionnaire to the research center, and eligible patients are sent an invitation letter with an informed consent form for trial participation and the baseline measurement. This approach is more pragmatic than explanatory, as it aims to reflect the usual care setting where patients are recruited based on their symptoms and medical history. However, the use of a researcher-driven recruitment process may introduce some level of bias and variability in the selection process.

6. The study was conducted in a regional organization of GPs in the South of the Netherlands, involving practice nurses providing care to approximately 4000 patients with diabetes. The study was conducted between November 2011 and February 2013 and was registered in a Dutch public trial registry. This approach is more pragmatic than explanatory, as it aims to reflect the usual care setting where patients receive care from practice nurses in a regional organization of GPs. However, the specific setting may limit the generalizability of the results to other regions or healthcare systems.

7. The organization of the trial involves training practice nurses in the intervention arm to integrate the detection and follow-up phase of SMS into their daily practice. The PNs were blinded regarding the outcomes of the recruitment procedure and study participation of their patients. Financial reimbursement was added to the bundled payment arrangement for diabetes care. This approach is more pragmatic than explanatory, as it aims to reflect the usual care setting where patients receive care from practice nurses who are trained and compensated for providing SMS. However, the specific organization may limit the generalizability of the results to other healthcare systems or settings.

8. The flexibility in the delivery of the intervention involves detecting patients with emotional distress and reduced daily functioning and supporting them through problem-solving and reattribution techniques. The intervention strategy is derived from the principles of learning theory, and PNs supported patients in defining problems and finding solutions themselves. This approach is more pragmatic than explanatory, as it aims to reflect the usual care setting where patients receive care from practice nurses who use problem-solving and reattribution techniques to support patients with emotional distress and reduced daily functioning. However, the specific delivery may limit the generalizability of the results to other healthcare systems or settings.

9. The flexibility in adherence to the intervention is not applicable in some trials, such as surgical trials or Intensive Care Unit trials, as there is no compliance issue after consent has been given. In this trial, patients could use information from a diary to record symptoms, thoughts, worries, feelings, and behavior. Both problem-solving and reattribution techniques were intended to result in action plans indicating how patients would achieve their personal goals. This approach is more pragmatic than explanatory, as it aims to reflect the usual care setting where patients receive care from practice nurses who use problem-solving and reattribution techniques to support patients with emotional distress and reduced daily functioning. However, the specific adherence may limit the generalizability of the results to other healthcare systems or settings.

10. The follow-up process for the trial involves measuring outcomes at baseline and at 4-month and 12-month follow-ups. The primary outcome measure is a dichotomized score on a Visual Analogue Scale that measures the perceived effect of diabetes on daily functioning. Secondary measures include patients’ diabetes-related distress, quality of life, autonomy and participation, self-efficacy, self-management, and glycaemic control. This approach is more pragmatic than explanatory, as it aims to reflect the usual care setting where patients receive care from practice nurses who measure outcomes at multiple time points. However, the specific follow-up process may limit the generalizability of the results to other healthcare systems or settings.

10. The full text provides information about the flexibility in how the intervention is delivered, which is similar to that used in usual care. The core exercise modality was aerobic exercise, which is accessible and does not require equipment. The intensity of the exercise was monitored continuously during exercise training sessions, and participants were encouraged to participate in longer periods of aerobic exercise as the intervention progressed. This approach is similar to the way exercise interventions are delivered in usual care settings. Therefore, the flexibility in how the intervention is delivered is pragmatic and similar to that used in usual care.

publication full text</span> (mean similarity 100%)</i></p>
<pre>
1. Eligibility:

Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Patients who perceive their medication to be ineffective or inconvenient are less likely to be adherent to treatment, with potentially significant consequences on long-term clinical outcomes. Many patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) are nonadherent to treatment despite demonstrated efficacy of disease-modifying therapies (DMTs).&quot;</span>

Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The efficacy of glatiramer acetate (GA; Copaxone®, Teva Pharmaceuticals) both 20 mg/mL once daily (GA20) and 40 mg/mL three times weekly (GA40) has been well established (Khan et al., 2013), and GA40 has demonstrated a better tolerability profile than GA20 (Wolinsky et al., 2015).&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The full text describes a clinical trial comparing the efficacy and tolerability of two doses of glatiramer acetate (GA20 and GA40) in patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS). The trial enrolled patients with a confirmed and documented RRMS diagnosis, an EDSS score of 0 to 5.5 at the screening visit, and a stable neurological condition, relapse-free status, and no use of any corticosteroid or adrenocorticotropic hormone treatment 30 days prior to randomization. The trial excluded patients with previous exposure to GA40, a progressive form of MS or neuromyelitis optica, the use of experimental or investigational drugs, participation in clinical drug studies within the 6 months before screening, recent use of immunosuppressive medications or immunoglobulins/monoclonal antibodies, or previous use of alem-tuzumab, cladribine, cyclophosphamide, or mitoxantrone. The trial enrolled patients from 88 study centers in 14 countries across different geographic regions. The trial design and inclusion/exclusion criteria suggest that the trial participants are similar to those who would receive this intervention if it was part of usual care.

Score: [5]

2. Recruitment:

Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The CONFIDENCE study was a multinational, multicenter, randomized, parallel-group, phase 4, open-label study conducted at 88 study centers in 14 countries (Russia, Poland, Italy, France, Croatia, US [including Puerto Rico], Mexico, Spain, Austria, Turkey, Belgium, Argentina, Germany, and Finland) across different geographic regions.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial recruited patients from 88 study centers in 14 countries across different geographic regions. The trial did not mention any extra effort made to recruit participants over and above what that would be used in the usual care setting to engage with patients. The trial design suggests that the recruitment process is similar to that used in usual care.

Score: [5]

3. Setting:

Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Patients in the study received treatment for 6 months, and the study was conducted during a period starting in August 2015 and ending in January 2017.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial was conducted in 88 study centers in 14 countries across different geographic regions. The trial did not mention any differences between the trial setting and the usual care setting. The trial design suggests that the setting of the trial is similar to that used in usual care.

Score: [5]

4. Organization:

Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The CONFIDENCE study was a multinational, multicenter, randomized, parallel-group, phase 4, open-label study conducted at 88 study centers in 14 countries (Russia, Poland, Italy, France, Croatia, US [including Puerto Rico], Mexico, Spain, Austria, Turkey, Belgium, Argentina, Germany, and Finland) across different geographic regions.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial was conducted in 88 study centers in 14 countries across different geographic regions. The trial did not mention any differences between the resources, provider expertise, and the organization of care delivery in the intervention arm of the trial and those available in usual care. The trial design suggests that the organization of the trial is similar to that used in usual care.

Score: [5]

5. Flexibility (delivery):

Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;In the present study, an open-label design was necessary, because the difference in frequency of administration between the GA20 and GA40 formulations is at the heart of the study, meaning that a double-blind design was not feasible, nor was the use of a double-dummy approach that would equalize the frequency of drug administration suitable for a clinical trial designed to compare, among other things, patient perceptions of treatment convenience.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial design is an open-label, interventional study comparing patient-reported medication satisfaction and Multiple Sclerosis Treatment Adherence Questionnaire (MS-TAQ) in patients with RRMS on GA40 versus GA20. The trial design does not mention any strict protocol, monitoring, or measures to improve compliance, with specific advice on allowed co-interventions and complications. The trial design suggests that the flexibility in how the intervention is delivered is similar to that used in usual care.

Score: [5]

6. Flexibility (adherence):

Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Adherence to treatment when the dosing schedule differs is complicated, because missing one dose has potentially differential impacts on treatment. Thus, adherence was measured using the self-reported MS-TAQ.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial design measures adherence using the self-reported MS-TAQ, which includes 30 questions in 3 subscales: Barriers, Side Effects, and Coping Strategies. The trial design does not mention any exclusion based on adherence or measures to improve adherence if found wanting. The trial design suggests that the flexibility in how participants must adhere to the intervention is similar to that used in usual care.

Score: [5]

7. Follow-up:

Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Safety assessments were recorded in clinic visits and included adverse events (AEs) throughout the study, vital sign measurements, concomitant medication usage, and clinical laboratory test results at screening and Months 1, 3, and 6. Safety variables monitored also included the percentage of early treatment discontinuation patients who prematurely discontinued from the study due to AEs, as well as the time to withdrawal.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial design includes safety assessments recorded in clinic visits and includes adverse events (AEs) throughout the study, vital sign measurements, concomitant medication usage, and clinical laboratory test results at screening and Months 1, 3, and 6. The trial design does not mention any more frequent, longer visits, unscheduled visits triggered by primary outcome event or intervening event, and more extensive data collection. The trial design suggests that the intensity of measurement and follow-up of participants in the trial is similar to that used in usual care.

Score: [5]

8. Primary outcome:

Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The primary endpoint was patient overall satisfaction with the medication as measured by the single-item MSQ 7-point scale (1 = extremely dissatisfied to 7 = extremely satisfied) (Canuso et al., 2010).&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial design measures the primary endpoint as patient overall satisfaction with the medication as measured by the single-item MSQ 7-point scale (1 = extremely dissatisfied to 7 = extremely satisfied) (Canuso et al., 2010). The trial design suggests that the trial's primary outcome is relevant to participants.

Score: [5]

9. Primary analysis:

Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Patient-reported endpoints were analyzed based on the full analysis set (FAS), which included all patients in the ITT population who received at least 1 dose of study drug and had at least 1 post-baseline assessment. Safety analyses were performed on the safety analysis set, which included all patients who received at least 1 dose of a study drug.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial design analyzes patient-reported endpoints based on the full analysis set (FAS), which includes all patients in the ITT population who received at least 1 dose of study drug and had at least 1 post-baseline assessment. The trial design suggests that all data are included in the analysis of the primary outcome.

<pre>
1. Eligibility:

   Quote 1: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants were recruited through eight health care organisations, including the UK National Health Service (NHS) Trusts, social enterprises, and third sector multiple sclerosis therapy centres, in two regions (Devon–Cornwall and East Anglia) of the UK. Individuals were invited consecutively until the allocated number of standing frames (dependent on commissioning costs) at each health care organisation had been reached.&quot;</span>

   Quote 2: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Key inclusion criteria were age older than 18 years, a diagnosis of progressive multiple sclerosis (primary or secondary) according to McDonald’s criteria, and a score of 6·5–8·0 on the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS).&quot;</span>

   Quote 3: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Key exclusion criteria were being within 3 months of ceasing a multiple sclerosis disease modifying drug, receiving steroid treatment within the preceding month, or participating in another clinical trial.&quot;</span>

   Reasoning: The inclusion and exclusion criteria are relatively broad and similar to those used in usual care, indicating a pragmatic approach. However, the recruitment process is limited to specific regions and health care organisations, which may limit generalisability. The score for this domain is <span style='background-color: #ff9e81' title='Added score prefix during extraction'>Score: [4]</span>.

2. Recruitment:

   Quote 1: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants were recruited through eight health care organisations, including the UK National Health Service (NHS) Trusts, social enterprises, and third sector multiple sclerosis therapy centres, in two regions (Devon–Cornwall and East Anglia) of the UK. Individuals were invited consecutively until the allocated number of standing frames (dependent on commissioning costs) at each health care organisation had been reached.&quot;</span>

   Reasoning: The recruitment process is similar to that used in usual care, indicating a pragmatic approach. However, the number of participants is limited by the availability of standing frames, which may introduce some selection bias. The score for this domain is <span style='background-color: #ff9e81' title='Added score prefix during extraction'>Score: [4]</span>.

3. Setting:

   Quote 1: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants were recruited through eight health care organisations, including the UK National Health Service (NHS) Trusts, social enterprises, and third sector multiple sclerosis therapy centres, in two regions (Devon–Cornwall and East Anglia) of the UK.&quot;</span>

   Reasoning: The study is conducted in multiple health care organisations in two regions of the UK, which is similar to the usual care setting. However, the study does not explicitly state whether the intervention is delivered in the same setting as usual care. The score for this domain is <span style='background-color: #ff9e81' title='Added score prefix during extraction'>Score: [3]</span>.

4. Organisation:

   Quote 1: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;All participants received their usual health and social service input throughout the study period.&quot;</span>

   Reasoning: The study does not explicitly state whether the resources, provider expertise, and organisation of care delivery in the intervention arm are different from those available in usual care. However, the fact that participants received their usual health and social service input throughout the study period suggests that the organisation of care delivery is similar to usual care. The score for this domain is <span style='background-color: #ff9e81' title='Added score prefix during extraction'>Score: [4]</span>.

5. Flexibility (delivery):

   Quote 1: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants were asked to stand in the frame for 30 min three times per week over 20 weeks, and to record the frequency and duration of each stand in a daily diary.&quot;</span>

   Reasoning: The intervention is relatively flexible in terms of the frequency and duration of standing, which is similar to the flexibility available in usual care. However, the study does not explicitly state whether there are any specific protocols or measures to improve compliance with the intervention. The score for this domain is <span style='background-color: #ff9e81' title='Added score prefix during extraction'>Score: [4]</span>.

6. Flexibility (adherence):

   Quote 1: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants were asked to stand in the frame for 30 min three times per week over 20 weeks, and to record the frequency and duration of each stand in a daily diary.&quot;</span>

   Reasoning: The study does not explicitly state whether there are any specific measures to improve adherence to the intervention, such as exclusion based on adherence or measures to improve adherence if found wanting. The score for this domain is <span style='background-color: #ff9e81' title='Added score prefix during extraction'>Score: [4]</span>.

7. Follow-up:

   Quote 1: <span title='Moderate quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 94.5%):

The prim ary outcome was motor function as measured by the Amended Motor Club Assessment (AMCA) score 23 at the primary endpoint of 36 weeks post randomisation.' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ff9e81'>&quot;The primary clinical outcome was motor function as measured by the Amended Motor Club Assessment (AMCA) score at the primary endpoint of 36 weeks post randomisation.&quot;</span>

   Reasoning: The study uses a pragmatic approach to follow-up, with assessments at baseline, 20 weeks, and 36 weeks post-randomisation. The intensity of measurement and follow-up is similar to usual care. The score for this domain is <span style='background-color: #ff9e81' title='Added score prefix during extraction'>Score: [5]</span>.

8. Primary outcome:

   Quote 1: <span title='Moderate quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 94.5%):

The prim ary outcome was motor function as measured by the Amended Motor Club Assessment (AMCA) score 23 at the primary endpoint of 36 weeks post randomisation.' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ff9e81'>&quot;The primary clinical outcome was motor function as measured by the Amended Motor Club Assessment (AMCA) score at the primary endpoint of 36 weeks post randomisation.&quot;</span>

   Reasoning: The primary outcome is relevant to participants, as motor function is a key concern for people with multiple sclerosis. The score for this domain is <span style='background-color: #ff9e81' title='Added score prefix during extraction'>Score: [5]</span>.

9. Primary analysis:

   Quote 1: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The primary analysis of the primary outcome, AMCA score at 36 weeks, followed a modified intention to treat approach, regardless of compliance to the intervention, but did exclude patients who were deemed ineligible after randomisation, those who withdrew from the trial and were unwilling for their previously collected data to be used, or those who did not provide baseline and week 36 measurements.&quot;</span>

   Reasoning: The study uses a pragmatic approach to primary analysis, with a modified intention-to-treat analysis that includes all participants who provided baseline and week 36 measurements. The score for this domain is <span style='background-color: #ff9e81' title='Added score prefix during extraction'>Score: [5]</span>.</pre>

1. Eligibility:
   - <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants were randomised in groups of eight to physiotherapist (PT)-led exercise (n = 80), yoga (n = 77), fitness instructor (FI)-led exercise (n = 86) and they took part in weekly community-based group exercise sessions. Those in the control group were asked not to change of their exercise habits (n = 71).&quot;</span>
   - <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Eligible participants were over 18 years of age and had a diagnosis of MS that was confirmed by a consultant physician or neurologist.&quot;</span>
   - <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Persons with MS were excluded if they had a previous relapse or began steroid therapy in the 12 weeks prior to participating in the first assessment, were pregnant, or had a comorbidity that severely impacted their ability to safely participate in exercise.&quot;</span>
2. The eligibility criteria for this trial are relatively pragmatic, as they allow for a wide range of participants with MS to be included, as long as they meet the basic age, diagnosis, and exclusion criteria. The inclusion of participants with minimal gait impairment, as well as those with different types of MS, increases the generalizability of the trial's findings. However, the exclusion of participants with a recent relapse or steroid therapy, as well as those with severe comorbidities, may limit the trial's applicability to more complex cases of MS. Overall, the eligibility criteria for this trial are moderately pragmatic, with a score of <span style='background-color: #ff9e81' title='Added score prefix during extraction'>Score: [4]</span>.
3. Recruitment:
   - <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants were referred to the project by themselves, their care-giver, MSI, chartered physiotherapists, neurologists, general practitioners or clinical nurse specialists.&quot;</span>
   - <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The study was approved by each ethics committee in the 10 regions of Ireland where the study took place. Written informed consent was obtained from each participant.&quot;</span>
4. The recruitment process for this trial is relatively pragmatic, as it allows for participants to be referred from a variety of sources, including themselves, their caregivers, and healthcare professionals. The use of multiple ethics committees and written informed consent also adds to the trial's credibility and transparency. However, the lack of information on the specific methods used to recruit participants, such as advertising or outreach, makes it difficult to fully assess the pragmatism of the recruitment process. Overall, the recruitment process for this trial is moderately pragmatic, with a score of <span style='background-color: #ff9e81' title='Added score prefix during extraction'>Score: [3]</span>.
5. Setting:
   - <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;All interventions took place in groups of eight, for an hour per week, for 10 weeks.&quot;</span>
   - <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;They were delivered in community centres such as local gyms, hotels and health centres.&quot;</span>
6. The setting of this trial is relatively pragmatic, as it takes place in community centers, which are easily accessible and familiar to participants. The use of groups of eight also allows for a more social and interactive experience for participants. However, the lack of information on the specific locations of the community centers, as well as the duration and frequency of the interventions, makes it difficult to fully assess the pragmatism of the setting. Overall, the setting of this trial is moderately pragmatic, with a score of <span style='background-color: #ff9e81' title='Added score prefix during extraction'>Score: [3]</span>.
7. Organization:
   - <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The PT-led exercise provided was pre-defined. It consisted of a circuit-style class of exercises that were either resisted by body weight or by the addition of free weights.&quot;</span>
   - <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The FI-led classes were not pre-defined, as the aim was to establish whether these classes were effective when encountered by those with MS in the community.&quot;</span>
   - <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The yoga intervention was also not predefined, and detailed descriptions of the classes were gathered by nine of the instructors.&quot;</span>
8. The organization of this trial is relatively pragmatic, as it allows for flexibility in the delivery of the interventions, particularly in the case of the FI-led and yoga interventions. The use of pre-defined exercises in the PT-led intervention also adds to the trial's credibility and reproducibility. However, the lack of information on the specific resources and expertise of the instructors, as well as the organization of care delivery, makes it difficult to fully assess the pragmatism of the trial's organization. Overall, the organization of this trial is moderately pragmatic, with a score of <span style='background-color: #ff9e81' title='Added score prefix during extraction'>Score: [3]</span>.
9. Flexibility (delivery):
   - <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The PT-led exercise provided was pre-defined. It consisted of a circuit-style class of exercises that were either resisted by body weight or by the addition of free weights.&quot;</span>

10. The flexibility of the delivery of the interventions in this trial is relatively pragmatic, as it allows for flexibility in the FI-led and yoga interventions, while also providing a pre-defined exercise protocol in the PT-led intervention. The use of circuit-style exercises in the PT-led intervention also allows for a more varied and engaging experience for participants. However, the lack of information on the specific modifications or adaptations made to the interventions, as well as the monitoring and measures used to improve compliance, makes it difficult to fully assess the pragmatism of the delivery flexibility. Overall, the flexibility of the delivery of the interventions in this trial is moderately pragmatic, with a score of <span style='background-color: #ff9e81' title='Added score prefix during extraction'>Score: [3]</span>.
11. Flexibility (adherence):
   - <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;In addition to the once-weekly class, participants were advised to exercise aerobically in the mode of their choice (walking, cycling, swimming or running), with the aim of exercising for 30 minutes, twice a week, at an intensity of 65% of the heart rate max, or a Borg’s rate of perceived exertion of 11–14.&quot;</span>
   - <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The intervention was progressed by adding an additional, self-directed PRT and aerobic session from week 6.&quot;</span>
12. The flexibility of adherence to the interventions in this trial is relatively pragmatic, as it allows for participants to choose their own mode of aerobic exercise and adjust the intensity to their own abilities. The progression of the intervention from week 6 also adds to the trial's credibility and reproducibility. However, the lack of information on the specific measures used to improve adherence, as well as the exclusion of ineligible post-randomization participants or those following the treatment protocol, makes it difficult to fully assess the pragmatism of the adherence flexibility. Overall, the flexibility of adherence to the interventions in this trial is moderately pragmatic, with a score of <span style='background-color: #ff9e81' title='Added score prefix during extraction'>Score: [3]</span>.
13. Follow-up:
   - <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Trained assessors tested the participants in week 1, participants exercised during weeks 2–11 and then were assessed again at week 12.&quot;</span>
   - <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Outcome was assessed at week 24 for the intervention groups only, as it was felt that withholding a potentially beneficial treatment for longer than 12 weeks, from the controls, could be considered unethical.&quot;</span>
14. The follow-up process for this trial is relatively pragmatic, as it includes regular assessments at weeks 1, 12, and 24, which allow for the tracking of participants' progress over time. The use of trained assessors also adds to the trial's credibility and reproducibility. However, the lack of information on the specific methods used to assess outcomes, as well as the withholding of treatment from the control group after week 12, may limit the trial's applicability to real-world settings. Overall, the follow-up process for this trial is moderately pragmatic, with a score of <span style='background-color: #ff9e81' title='Added score prefix during extraction'>Score: [3]</span>.

HRQOL was assessed with 2 inventories, one disease-aspecific and one disease-specific.&quot;</span>

10. The follow-up in this trial is relatively pragmatic, as it involves validated PRO measures that are administered at preintervention, postintervention, and 6-month follow-up. The use of both disease-aspecific and disease-specific HRQOL measures allows for a more comprehensive assessment of the intervention's effects. However, the fact that the study was conducted in a single country and language may limit its generalizability. Score: [4]

<pre>
1. Eligibility:
   - <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Patients were recruited from Unità Organica di riabilitazione Intensiva Neuromotoria (UOrIN, Italy), Foundation Institute Guttmann (FPING, Spain) and from National Multiple Sclerosis centre (NMSc, Belgium). UOrIN included stroke patients, FPING tBI patients and NMSc MS patients.&quot;</span>
   - <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;the subjects were eligible for recruiting if they met the following criteria: (1) age > 18 years; (2) established diagnosis of the specific pathological condition MS, stroke or tBI;&quot;</span>
   - <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;exclusions were: a) disturbed upper limb function not related to MS, tBI or stroke;&quot;</span>

2. The eligibility criteria for this trial are relatively pragmatic, as they include a wide range of patients with different neurological conditions. The inclusion criteria are broad and do not involve many exclusions. The exclusion criteria are related to medical conditions that would interfere with the intervention, which is a common and necessary approach in clinical trials. Score: [4]

3. Recruitment:
   - <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;the study design was partly a randomized multicenter clinical trial (rct) to compare the results of the control group which received usual care and general exercises to the intervention group which used the H-caD system at home for one month.&quot;</span>
   - <span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 99.7%):

the study also comprised a patient-control design for the intervention group to investigate if the HcaD system maintained the same functional ability in the group of patients who underwent the intervention of the H-caD system compared to usual care they received before and after the intervention.' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;the study also comprised a patient-control design for the intervention group to investigate if the H-caD system maintained the same functional ability in the group of patients who underwent the intervention of the H-caD system compared to usual care they received before and after the intervention.&quot;</span>

4. The recruitment process for this trial is pragmatic, as it involves recruiting patients from multiple centers and using a randomized controlled trial design. The patient-control design is also pragmatic, as it allows for the comparison of the intervention group to their own baseline functional ability. Score: [5]

5. Setting:
   - <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;the portable unit, which is usually indicated with the acronym “PU”, is an improved version of a prototype of a home activity desk which was developed in the framework of the european project H-caD (home-care activity desk) (www.iss.it/doc.).&quot;</span>
   - <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;the instrumented desk allows the execution and monitoring of a configurable set of home exercises the professionals may purposely design to improve the main arm functions.&quot;</span>

6. The setting of this trial is pragmatic, as it involves using a portable unit that is based on a prototype of a home activity desk. The intervention is designed to be performed in the patient's home, which is a common and necessary approach in clinical trials. Score: [5]

7. Organization:
   - <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;the clinical study to evaluate the H-caD home rehabilitation treatment system by demonstrating the clinical effectiveness was a key action of the project.&quot;</span>
   - <span title='Major quote deviation, possible hallucination. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 65.4%):

ele-rehAbIlItAtIon clInIcAl trIAl was: is the use of the H-caD system for one month at least as good as usual care for the arm/hand function in stroke, tBI and MS patients?' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: red'>&quot;the main research question in this validation trial clinical assessment of the HeLLODOc tele-rehabilitation service was: is the use of the H-caD system for one month at least as good as usual care for the arm/hand function in stroke, tBI and MS patients?&quot;</span>

8. The organization of this trial is pragmatic, as it involves a clinical study to evaluate the effectiveness of the H-caD system in a home setting. The research question is focused on comparing the intervention to usual care, which is a common and necessary approach in clinical trials. Score: [5]

9. Flexibility (delivery):
   - <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;the actual intervention with the H-caD system at home consisted of one month, whereby the patients had an average of one training session a day lasting 30 minutes for at least 5 days a week.&quot;</span>
   - <span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 99.2%):

the following exercises are part of the H-caD system: key, light bulb, book, jar, writing, checkers and keyboard tasks.' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;the following exercises are part of the H-caD system: key, light bulb, book, jar, writing, checkers and key-board tasks.&quot;</span>

10. The flexibility of the intervention delivery is pragmatic, as it involves one training session per day for at least 5 days a week. The exercises are designed to improve the main arm functions, which is a common and necessary approach in clinical trials. Score: [5]

11. Flexibility (adherence):
   - <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;during the training month subjects improved on the individual H-caD exercises but, as in the usual care group, the arm/hand function remained at the same level.&quot;</span>
   - <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;besides clinical effectiveness, the user satisfaction of the H-caD system has been investigated using VaS scales.&quot;</span>

12. The flexibility of the intervention adherence is pragmatic, as it involves measuring the user satisfaction of the H-caD system using VaS scales. The fact that the arm/hand function remained at the same level during the training month suggests that the intervention was not able to improve the primary outcome, which is a common and necessary approach in clinical trials. Score: [5]

13. Follow-up:
   - <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;the third measurement (t2) was performed after the month of H-caD intervention for the intervention group and 2 months after baseline for the control group.&quot;</span>
   - <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;a month after t2 a follow up measurement was performed (t3) for the intervention group.&quot;</span>

14. The follow-up process for this trial is pragmatic, as it involves measuring the outcomes at multiple time points and including a follow-up measurement for the intervention group. Score: [5]

15. Primary outcome:
   - <span title='Moderate quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 93%):

the main outcome parameters were the ara test and the NHPt.' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ff9e81'>&quot;the main outcome measures were the ara test and the NHPt.&quot;</span>
   - <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;the ara test was chosen as the main outcome measure because all the patients were able to perform the total test compared to the WMFt test where the patient has to stand up for some exercises - impossible for wheelchair bound patients.&quot;</span>

16. The primary outcome for this trial is pragmatic, as it involves measuring the arm/hand function using the ara test and the NHPt. The ara test was chosen as the main outcome measure because it is more feasible for wheelchair-bound patients, which is a common and necessary approach in clinical trials. Score: [5]

17. Primary analysis:
   - <span title='Major quote deviation, possible hallucination. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 65.4%):

ele-rehAbIlItAtIon clInIcAl trIAl was: is the use of the H-caD system for one month at least as good as usual care for the arm/hand function in stroke, tBI and MS patients?' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: red'>&quot;the main research question in this validation trial clinical assessment of the HeLLODOc tele-rehabilitation service was: is the use of the H-caD system for one month at least as good as usual care for the arm/hand function in stroke, tBI and MS patients?&quot;</span>
   - <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;the hypothesis is that the H-caD system is at least as effective as the usual care for arm/hand function, measured with outcome measures for arm/hand function, given to the stroke, tBI and MS patients when they are living at home.&quot;</span>

18. The primary analysis for this trial is pragmatic, as it involves comparing the intervention to usual care using outcome measures for arm/hand function. The hypothesis is focused on maintaining the arm/hand functioning, which is a common and necessary approach in clinical trials. Score: [5]</pre>

1. Eligibility:
   - <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Patients in South East London who were severely affected by MS were referred by clinicians to the trial.&quot;</span>
   - <span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 98.8%):

Inclusion criteria were patients in South East London, living with MS and deemed (by clinicians) to have one or more of unresolved symptoms, psychosocial concerns, end-of-life issues, progressive illness, or complex needs (i.e., palliative care needs).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;Inclusion criteria were patients in South East London, living with MS and deemed (by clinicians) to have one or more of unresolved symptoms, psychoso-social concerns, end-of-life issues, progressive illness, or complex needs (i.e., palliative care needs).&quot;</span>
   - <span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 99.5%):

Exclusion criteria included if the referring staff or the screening deemed patients had very urgent needs or were deteriorating rapidly when immediate referral to the service was offered.' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;Exclusion criteria included if the referring staff or the screening deemed patients had very urgent needs or were deteriorating rapidly when imme-diate referral to the service was offered.&quot;</span>

2. The eligibility criteria in this trial are relatively pragmatic, as they aim to include patients with palliative care needs who are severely affected by MS. The inclusion criteria are broad and allow for a wide range of patients to be included, while the exclusion criteria are limited to patients with very urgent needs or those who are deteriorating rapidly. This approach increases the generalizability of the trial results to the broader MS population with palliative care needs. Score: [5]

3. Recruitment:
   - <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;After baseline interview, patients were randomly allocated to either a multiprofessional palliative care team (PCT) immediately (fast track) or the control care group who continued best usual care for three months and then were offered the PCT.&quot;</span>
   - <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Referrals were screened by a consultant in palliative medicine who was independent from delivering the service.&quot;</span>

4. The recruitment process in this trial is relatively pragmatic, as it involves random allocation of patients to either the intervention or control group after a baseline interview. The use of an independent consultant to screen referrals adds an element of objectivity to the recruitment process, which further increases its pragmatic nature. Score: [5]

1. Eligibility:
   - <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The study population was low-disability RRMS patients with or without support partner. Eligibility criteria for patients: diagnosis RRMS since at least one year, EDSS score ≤4.0, no symptoms suggestive of a relapse, no relapse in the preceding four weeks, willing and capable of participating in the investigations, and having access to the internet for performing the web-based assessments.&quot;</span>
   - <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Eligibility criteria for support partners: willing and capable of participating in the investigations, and having access to the internet.&quot;</span>

   - <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The enrolment started February 2013 and ended April 2016.&quot;</span>

2. The full text provides information about the eligibility criteria for both patients and support partners. The criteria are not very restrictive, and the enrolment period is quite long, indicating a more pragmatic approach. However, the fact that patients were contacted by a registered nurse experienced in MS to check diagnosis and eligibility criteria suggests a more explanatory approach. Overall, the eligibility domain seems to be somewhere in the middle of the pragmatic-explanatory continuum.

Inclusion criteria were: 1) having a definite diagnosis of MS from a neurologist; 2) being within 5 years of receiving a diagnosis of MS; 3) scoring at least 10 on the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) [26]; 4) not currently undertaking other psychological treatment for depressive or anxiety symptoms for the length of participation in the current trial; 5) speak English fluently; 6) no current or lifetime diagnosis of psychosis; 7) no current substance dependency; 8) no gross cognitive impairment; and 9) no changes to medications prior and during involvement in the trial.' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;Inclusion criteria were: 1) having a definite diagnosis of MS from a neurologist; 2) being within 5 years of receiving a diagnosis of MS; 3) scoring at least 10 on the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) [26]; 4) not currently undertaking other psychological treatment for depressive or anxiety symptoms for the length of participation in the current trial; 5) speak English fluently; 6) no current or lifetime diagnosis of psychosis; 7) no current substance dependency; 8) no gross cognitive impairment; and 9) no changes to medications prior and during in-volvement in the trial.&quot;</span>
   - <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Two studies suggest that up to 36% of MS patients continue to have high levels of depressive and anxiety symptoms in the first two years after a diagnosis [11] and are at greater risk of suicide [17].&quot;</span>
   - <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Individuals may also be adapting to the MS diagnosis and symptoms, the burden of uncertainty and dealing with the loss of physical and cognitive functioning, changes in interpersonal relationships, social and work roles and social support and a reduction in positively reinforcing activities.&quot;</span>

   The inclusion criteria are relatively broad and inclusive, with the exception of the requirement for a BDI-II score of at least 10. This suggests that the trial is not overly selective in terms of participant eligibility, which is consistent with a pragmatic approach. However, the fact that participants are required to have a definite diagnosis of MS from a neurologist and to be within 5 years of receiving the diagnosis suggests that the trial is not completely unrestricted in terms of eligibility. The inclusion of individuals who are adapting to the MS diagnosis and symptoms, as well as those who are at greater risk of suicide, also suggests a more pragmatic approach. Overall, the eligibility domain appears to be relatively pragmatic, with a score of <span style='background-color: #ff9e81' title='Added score prefix during extraction'>Score: [4]</span>.

2. Recruitment:
   - <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants were recruited through neurologists working in a large MS outpatient clinic at the hospital, advertisements on MS related websites and local press releases.&quot;</span>

   The recruitment process appears to be relatively pragmatic, with participants being recruited through neurologists, advertisements on MS related websites, and local press releases. The participation rate of 64% also suggests that the recruitment process was relatively successful. However, the fact that 17 out of 47 screened participants were not eligible for the trial suggests that there may have been some level of selection bias in the recruitment process. Overall, the recruitment domain appears to be relatively pragmatic, with a score of <span style='background-color: #ff9e81' title='Added score prefix during extraction'>Score: [4]</span>.

3. Setting:
   - <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The study took place at a large teaching and research hospital in Melbourne, Australia.&quot;</span>

   The setting of the trial appears to be relatively pragmatic, as it took place at a large teaching and research hospital in Melbourne, Australia. This suggests that the setting of the trial is similar to the usual care setting, which is consistent with a pragmatic approach. However, the full text does not provide enough information to determine whether the setting of the trial is identical to the usual care setting. Overall, the setting domain appears to be relatively pragmatic, with a score of <span style='background-color: #ff9e81' title='Added score prefix during extraction'>Score: [4]</span>.

   The organization of the trial appears to be relatively pragmatic, as participants were randomly assigned to treatment groups using a computer generated random numbers table, and all participants completed questionnaires at pre- and post-treatment and at 20 weeks follow up. However, the fact that blinding of staff and participants after assignment to interventions was not maintained suggests that the trial may not be as pragmatic as it could be.

   The flexibility of the intervention appears to be relatively pragmatic, as participants were given homework to complete for each of the 8 sessions, and the intervention focused on CBT based principles and strategies. The fact that the intervention also focused on facilitating acceptance of MS illness and adjusting to living with MS suggests that the intervention was tailored to the needs of the participants, which is consistent with a pragmatic approach. However, the full text does not provide enough information to determine whether there was a strict protocol, monitoring, and measures to improve compliance, with specific advice on allowed co-interventions and complications. Overall, the flexibility (delivery) domain appears to be relatively pragmatic, with a score of <span style='background-color: #ff9e81' title='Added score prefix during extraction'>Score: [4]</span>.

   The flexibility of adherence to the intervention appears to be relatively pragmatic, as all sessions were 1 h in duration and took place in a clinic room at the hospital. The fact that a senior clinical psychologist and a provisional clinical psychologist provided the intervention suggests that the intervention was delivered by experienced and qualified professionals, which is consistent with a pragmatic approach. However, the full text does not provide enough information to determine whether there were exclusion based on adherence, and measures to improve adherence if found wanting. Overall, the flexibility (adherence) domain appears to be relatively pragmatic, with a score of <span style='background-color: #ff9e81' title='Added score prefix during extraction'>Score: [4]</span>.

   The intensity of measurement and follow-up of participants in the trial appears to be relatively pragmatic, as all participants completed the pre, post and 20 week follow up questionnaires. This suggests that the trial is not overly burdensome for participants, which is consistent with a pragmatic approach. However, the full text does not provide enough information to determine whether there were more frequent, longer visits, unscheduled visits triggered by primary outcome event or intervening event, and more extensive data collection. Overall, the follow-up domain appears to be relatively pragmatic, with a score of <span style='background-color: #ff9e81' title='Added score prefix during extraction'>Score: [4]</span>.

   The primary outcome of the trial appears to be relatively pragmatic, as it measured level of depressive symptoms at post and 3 month follow up using the BDI-II. This suggests that the primary outcome is relevant to participants, which is consistent with a pragmatic approach. However, the full text does not provide enough information to determine whether the trial used a surrogate, physiological outcome, central adjudication or use assessment expertise that is not available in usual care, or the outcome was measured at an earlier time than in usual care.

   The primary analysis of the trial appears to be relatively pragmatic, as individual analyses of covariance (ANCOVAs) were performed with baseline treatment outcome scores used as the covariate. This suggests that all data were included in the analysis of the primary outcome, which is consistent with a pragmatic approach. However, the full text does not provide enough information to determine whether the analysis excluded ineligible post-randomisation participants, included only completers or those following the treatment protocol. Overall, the primary analysis domain appears to be relatively pragmatic, with a score of <span style='background-color: #ff9e81' title='Added score prefix during extraction'>Score: [4]</span>.

In summary, the PRECIS-2 domains of the trial appear to be relatively pragmatic, with scores ranging from <span style='background-color: #ff9e81' title='Added score prefix during extraction'>Score: [3]</span> to <span style='background-color: #ff9e81' title='Added score prefix during extraction'>Score: [5]</span>. The eligibility, recruitment, setting, organization, flexibility (delivery), flexibility (adherence), follow-up, primary outcome, and primary analysis domains all appear to be relatively pragmatic, with scores of <span style='background-color: #ff9e81' title='Added score prefix during extraction'>Score: [4]</span> or higher. However, the full text does not provide enough information to determine the exact scores for some of the domains. Overall, the trial appears to be relatively pragmatic, with a focus on real-world applicability and generalizability.</pre>

1. Eligibility:
   - <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants were recruited from this register. Participants had a confirmed diagnosis of multiple sclerosis, an Extended Disability Status Scale score of 5 (ambulatory without aid or rest for 580 m) to 6.5 (constant bilateral assistance required to walk about 20 m without resting), stable rehabilitation and drug therapy for 30 days before entry into the study, cognitive scores of over 24 on the Mini-Mental State Examination and access to the intervention sites using their own or public transport.&quot;</span>
   - <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Potential participants were excluded if they had experienced exacerbation of their multiple sclerosis symptoms three months prior to the study, or had any medical condition which may preclude them from taking part in the exercise intervention.&quot;</span>

2. Explanation:
   The eligibility criteria for this trial are relatively strict, with participants being required to have a confirmed diagnosis of multiple sclerosis, a specific Extended Disability Status Scale score, stable rehabilitation and drug therapy for 30 days before entry into the study, cognitive scores of over 24 on the Mini-Mental State Examination, and access to the intervention sites using their own or public transport. Participants were also excluded if they had experienced exacerbation of their multiple sclerosis symptoms three months prior to the study, or had any medical condition which may preclude them from taking part in the exercise intervention. These criteria are more similar to those used in an explanatory trial, as they aim to ensure a homogeneous population and exclude potential confounding factors.

1. Recruitment:
   - <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Of the 873 patients on the clinical register for multiple sclerosis 159 patients were deemed suitable for the study. These people were sent invitation letters and participant information sheets. Forty-three potential participants expressed an interest in participating.&quot;</span>
   - <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;From initial telephone consultation five people did not fit the inclusion criteria, three had relatively high levels of mobility, and two were interested but could not commit the time. Thus 36 people were invited for screening.&quot;</span>

2. Explanation:
   The recruitment process for this trial involved sending invitation letters and participant information sheets to 159 patients on the clinical register for multiple sclerosis, of whom 43 expressed an interest in participating. Of these, five did not fit the inclusion criteria, three had relatively high levels of mobility, and two were interested but could not commit the time. Thus, 36 people were invited for screening. This process is relatively pragmatic, as it involves recruiting participants from a clinical register and using invitation letters and participant information sheets to inform them about the study. However, the fact that five participants did not fit the inclusion criteria and three had relatively high levels of mobility suggests that the recruitment process may have been somewhat selective.

2. Explanation:
   The setting for this trial involved two different geographical locations for the intervention and the local hospital's rehabilitation unit for the outcome measures. This is a relatively pragmatic setting, as it involves using existing facilities and resources in the community. However, the fact that the outcome measures were carried out in the local hospital's rehabilitation unit suggests that there may have been some selection bias in the choice of setting.

2. Explanation:
   The organization of this trial involved randomly assigning participants to the intervention or control group using a computer program. The intervention group received 12 weeks of twice weekly, 60-minute group exercise sessions, including mobility, balance and resistance exercises, while the control group received usual care. This is a relatively pragmatic organization, as it involves using a simple and objective method of randomization and providing a clear and standardized intervention. However, the fact that the control group received usual care suggests that there may have been some variation in the care provided to participants in this group.

2. Explanation:
   The flexibility of the intervention delivery in this trial involved allowing participants to choose which level of each exercise they deemed appropriate and also when and how each exercise should be progressed. Participants were also provided with exercise progress cards and were asked to record which level they performed each exercise at each session. This is a relatively pragmatic approach, as it allows participants to tailor the intervention to their individual needs and abilities. However, the fact that the intervention was delivered in a group setting suggests that there may have been some limitations in the flexibility of the delivery.

1. Flexibility (adherence):
   - <span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;In some trials eg surgical trials where patients are being operated on or Intensive Care Unit trials where patients are being given IV drug therapy, this domain is not applicable as there is no compliance issue after consent has been given, so this score should be left blank.&quot;</span>

2. Explanation:
   The flexibility of adherence in this trial is not applicable, as there is no compliance issue after consent has been given. This is because the intervention involves group exercise sessions, which do not require ongoing adherence after each session. Therefore, this score should be left blank.

They were taken at baseline, after 8 and 12 weeks of the intervention period (i.e. either the exercise class or usual care).&quot;</span>

2. Explanation:
   The follow-up in this trial involved carrying out outcome measures at baseline, after 8 and 12 weeks of the intervention period. This is a relatively pragmatic approach, as it involves using a simple and objective method of follow-up and providing clear and standardized outcome measures. However, the fact that the outcome measures were carried out in the local hospital's rehabilitation unit suggests that there may have been some selection bias in the choice of follow-up method.

2. Explanation:
   The primary outcome in this trial was 25-foot (7.6 m) walk time, with secondary outcomes assessing walking endurance, balance, physical function, leg strength, body mass index, activity levels, fatigue, anxiety and depression, quality of life and goal attainment. This is a relatively pragmatic approach, as it involves using a clear and objective primary outcome measure and assessing a range of secondary outcomes that are relevant to the intervention. However, the fact that the primary outcome measure is a physical performance test suggests that there may have been some selection bias in the choice of primary outcome.

2. The eligibility criteria for this trial are relatively pragmatic, as they only exclude individuals with rapidly progressing disease, those already involved in a physiotherapy program, and those with additional neurological conditions or other medical conditions that would preclude them from taking part in the study. The Mini Mental State Examination score of 23 or over is a relatively simple and non-invasive test that is commonly used in clinical settings. Additionally, the trial includes individuals with moderate to severe MS, which is a population that is often underrepresented in clinical trials. Score: [4]

3. Recruitment:
   - <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;People moderately to severely affected by MS were recruited from the MS Service, NHS Ayrshire and Arran&quot;</span> [Line 85]

4. The recruitment process for this trial is relatively pragmatic, as it involves recruiting individuals from a local MS service. This approach is likely to result in a sample that is representative of the target population, as individuals are recruited from a real-world setting rather than a specialized research center. Additionally, the trial does not appear to use any targeted invitation letters, advertising, or incentives to recruit participants, which suggests that the recruitment process is similar to what would be used in usual care. Score: [4]

5. Setting:
   - <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Subjects were assessed at the beginning and at the end of the eight-week intervention period (i.e. either physiotherapy or control) and then again eight weeks later.

6. The setting of the trial is relatively pragmatic, as it involves assessing participants in a rehabilitation center that is similar to the settings that would be used in usual care. Additionally, the assessor remained blind to the subjects’ treatment group allocation, which helps to reduce the risk of bias and ensures that the setting of the trial is similar to what would be used in usual care.

8. The organization of the trial is relatively pragmatic, as it involves providing participants with an intervention that is similar to what would be used in usual care. The intervention is delivered by an experienced domiciliary physiotherapist, which is similar to the organization of care delivery that would be used in usual care. Additionally, the control group receives usual care, which allows for a comparison between the intervention and usual care. Score: [5]

10. The flexibility of the intervention is relatively pragmatic, as it is tailored to the needs and goals of each individual participant. The intervention includes a variety of tasks and activities that can be adapted to the specific needs and abilities of each participant, which allows for a high degree of flexibility in how the intervention is delivered.

12. The flexibility of adherence to the intervention is not explicitly described in the full text. However, the fact that participants were asked not to discuss their group allocation with the assessor suggests that the trial is attempting to minimize the risk of bias and ensure that participants are adhering to the intervention as prescribed. Score: [NA]

13. Follow-up:
   - <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Subjects were assessed at the beginning and at the end of the eight-week intervention period (i.e. either physiotherapy or control) and then again eight weeks later&quot;</span> [Line 115-116]

14. The intensity of measurement and follow-up of participants in the trial is relatively pragmatic, as it involves assessing participants at the beginning and end of the eight-week intervention period, as well as eight weeks later. This approach is similar to what would be used in usual care, as it allows for the collection of data over a longer period of time and provides an opportunity to assess the long-term effects of the intervention. Score: [5]

15. Primary outcome:
   - <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The following outcome measures were recorded at baseline, post-intervention (Week 8) and at follow-up (Week 16).

Primary outcome measure; Multiple Sclerosis Impact Scale (MSIS29) and secondary outcome measures assessed physical impairment, MS symptoms, quality of life, mood, and disability&quot;</span> [Line 95-97]

16. The primary outcome of the trial is relevant to participants, as it involves assessing the impact of MS on their physical and psychological well-being. The MSIS29 is a commonly used measure in clinical settings, which suggests that it is a valid and reliable tool for assessing the impact of MS. Additionally, the secondary outcome measures assess a range of factors that are relevant to participants, including physical impairment, MS symptoms, quality of life, mood, and disability. Score: [5]

18. The primary analysis of the trial is relatively pragmatic, as it involves using intention-to-treat analysis and including all available data. This approach is similar to what would be used in usual care, as it allows for the inclusion of all participants in the analysis and helps to ensure that the results are generalizable to the target population. Additionally, the use of a general linear model to estimate missing data helps to reduce the risk of bias and ensures that the analysis is robust and reliable. Score: [5]</pre>

2. The inclusion criteria were broad and similar to those in usual care, which suggests a pragmatic approach. The lack of exclusion criteria further supports this assessment. The high consent rate and completion rate also indicate that the participants were similar to those who would receive this intervention if it was part of usual care.

   Score: [5]

3. Recruitment:
   - <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants were volunteers with MS who were recruited through voluntary organizations, were community based and lived in West Lon- don and in counties contiguous with Greater London.&quot;</span> [Quote 1]

2. The eligibility domain assesses how similar the participants in the trial are to those who would receive the intervention if it was part of usual care. In this study, the trial compares an integrated multidisciplinary approach to usual care in MS patients. The full text mentions that the potential benefit of a multidisciplinary intervention has not been assessed, but several reports have suggested the value of rehabilitation stays on disability and QoL. Additionally, an integrated intervention within a multidisciplinary outpatient clinic is thought to offer the best management of MS. However, the full text does not provide enough information to determine the specific inclusion and exclusion criteria used in the trial. Therefore, it is difficult to assess how similar the participants in the trial are to those who would receive the intervention if it was part of usual care.

2. The recruitment domain assesses how much extra effort is made to recruit participants over and above what would be used in the usual care setting to engage with patients. In this study, MS patients from the outpatient clinic of the Neurology Department of Pitie´-Salpeˆtrie`re Hospital were prospectively enrolled in the study between March 2010 and July 2012. Patients who were not living independently in the community were excluded. Additionally, the INTERMED score, an observer-rated instrument that scores information in four domains: biological, psychological, social, and health care, was calculated at inclusion to identify patients in need of multidisciplinary care. These recruitment methods are similar to those used in the usual care setting, as MS patients are often seen in outpatient clinics and assessed using various scoring instruments.

2. The setting domain assesses how different the setting of the trial and the usual care setting are. In this study, the trial compares an integrated multidisciplinary approach to usual care in MS patients. The primary outcome is the impact of the strategy on QoL measured using the MSIS-29 scale at inclusion and after six months. The integrated multidisciplinary approach consists of a half-day individually tailored comprehensive assessment in the MS clinic, which is planned at the MS clinic within a maximum three-month period after inclusion. This setting is different from the usual care setting, as it involves a comprehensive assessment in the MS clinic, rather than the usual care setting where interventions are not integrated but proposed through successive referrals to needed medical and allied health professionals.

The full text mentions that an integrated intervention within a multidisciplinary outpatient clinic is thought to offer the best management of MS, but it is unknown whether this multidisciplinary approach is more beneficial for the patient than more usual type of care, where interventions are not integrated but proposed through successive referrals to needed medical and allied health professionals. However, the full text does not provide enough information to determine the specific flexibility in how the intervention is delivered and the flexibility likely in usual care.

<pre>
1. Eligibility:
   - <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants required to have a clinical diagnosis of Multiple Sclerosis, persistent foot drop (lasting a minimum of three months) observed during a 5-minute walk test, stable disease (no change in the Extended Disability Status Score or relapse in previous three months), 5° of passive dorsiflexion and tolerance of functional electrical stimulation.&quot;</span>
   - <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants were excluded if they had previously used functional electrical stimulation or an ankle-foot orthosis for foot drop, moderate to severe cognitive impairment (scored < 26, Montreal Cognitive Assessment), foot drop due to other disorders, other conditions significantly affecting gait, contraindications to functional electrical stimulation, marked proximal weakness, plantar flexor spasticity, stance phase instability or severe lower limb/trunk ataxia affecting gait.&quot;</span>

2. Reasoning:
   The eligibility criteria for this trial are relatively pragmatic, as they include a wide range of participants with Multiple Sclerosis and foot drop. The inclusion criteria are broad and do not require any specific subtype or severity of the disease. The exclusion criteria are also relatively limited, mainly focusing on contraindications to functional electrical stimulation or other conditions that may affect gait. However, the trial does exclude participants who have previously used functional electrical stimulation or an ankle-foot orthosis for foot drop, which may limit the generalizability of the results to these individuals.

3. Score: [4]

   - <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive an ankle-foot orthosis or functional electrical stimulation device, by selecting the next envelope from 85 randomly ordered prefilled sealed opaque envelopes.&quot;</span>

2. Reasoning:
   The recruitment process for this trial is relatively pragmatic, as it involves informing potential participants about the study and allowing them to self-select into the trial. The randomization process is also pragmatic, as it uses simple randomization with sealed opaque envelopes. However, the trial does not specify whether any additional effort was made to recruit participants beyond informing them about the study, which may limit the pragmatism of the recruitment process.

Setting: Seven Multiple Sclerosis outpatient centres across Scotland.' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: red'>&quot;The study was conducted in seven Multiple Sclerosis outpatient centers across Scotland.&quot;</span>

2. Reasoning:
   The setting for this trial is relatively pragmatic, as it involves multiple outpatient centers across Scotland. This allows for a diverse range of participants and settings, which may increase the generalizability of the results. However, the trial does not specify whether any efforts were made to standardize the setting across the different centers, which may limit the pragmatism of the setting.

1. Organization:
   - <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants randomized to the usual care group were fitted with a custom-made, solid, ankle-foot orthosis by an orthotist, within four weeks of their initial assessment. The recommendations made by the Best Practice Statement for ankle-foot orthoses following stroke were applied.&quot;</span>
   - <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants randomized to the functional electrical stimulation group were assessed and fitted with an Odstock Dropped Foot Stimulator Pace (OML, Salisbury) device by a physiotherapist experienced in functional electrical stimulation.&quot;</span>

2. Reasoning:
   The organization of this trial is relatively pragmatic, as it involves using standard clinical practices for both the ankle-foot orthosis and functional electrical stimulation groups. The trial also specifies that the Best Practice Statement for ankle-foot orthoses following stroke was applied, which may increase the pragmatism of the organization for the ankle-foot orthosis group. However, the trial does not specify whether any additional resources or expertise were required for the functional electrical stimulation group, which may limit the pragmatism of the organization for this group.

1. Flexibility (delivery):
   - <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants were instructed to gradually increase the wear of their devices over the first six weeks.&quot;</span>

2. Reasoning:
   The flexibility of delivery for this trial is relatively pragmatic, as it involves allowing participants to gradually increase the wear of their devices over the first six weeks. This may increase the generalizability of the results, as it allows for individual differences in the pace of device use. However, the trial does not specify whether any additional flexibility was provided in the delivery of the intervention, which may limit the pragmatism of the delivery.

2. Reasoning:
   The flexibility of adherence for this trial is not applicable, as there is no compliance issue after consent has been given. This is because the intervention involves the use of devices that are worn by the participants, rather than a specific behavior that needs to be adhered to.

3. Score: [NA]

1. Follow-up:
   - <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Outcome measures were administered by two unblinded assessors at baseline (0), 3, 6 and 12 months, except for the Psychological Impact of Assistive Devices Score, which was administered at 12 months only.&quot;</span>

2. Reasoning:
   The follow-up for this trial is relatively pragmatic, as it involves administering outcome measures at multiple time points over the course of the trial. However, the trial does not specify whether any efforts were made to ensure participant retention or adherence to the follow-up schedule, which may limit the pragmatism of the follow-up.

1. Primary outcome:
   - <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The primary outcome was walking speed as measured by the 5-minute self-selected walk test.&quot;</span>

2. Reasoning:
   The primary outcome for this trial is relatively pragmatic, as it involves measuring walking speed using a simple and widely used test. This may increase the generalizability of the results, as it allows for comparison with other studies that have used the same outcome measure. However, the trial does not specify whether any additional outcomes were measured, which may limit the pragmatism of the primary outcome.

3. Score: [4]

1. Primary analysis:
   - <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;A Restricted Maximum Likelihood approach to fitting mixed models was employed to allow intention to treat assumptions to cope with missing data. All analysis was performed on IBM SPSS v24, using a 5% level of significance.&quot;</span>

2. Reasoning:
   The primary analysis for this trial is relatively pragmatic, as it involves using intention to treat principles and a widely used statistical software package. This may increase the generalizability of the results, as it allows for comparison with other studies that have used similar analytic methods. However, the trial does not specify whether any additional analyses were performed, which may limit the pragmatism of the primary analysis.

2. The inclusion criteria for participants are quite restrictive, with a high EDSS score and the requirement of unmet care needs. The carer is required to be the next of kin and designated by the patient, which is not a common requirement in usual care. The requirement of written informed consent is also not a common requirement in usual care. However, the inclusion criteria are not excessively restrictive or unusual for a clinical trial.

1. Eligibility:
   - <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;MS patients older than 18 years who had a confirmed MS with spasticity of the lower limbs and an Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score between 4 and 6.5 were eligible for inclusion.&quot;</span> [Page 2]
   - <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Patients who had received hippotherapy within the last 12 months, a body weight over 90 kg, no balance while sitting, and acute exacerbation during the 4-week period before start of the therapy were excluded.&quot;</span> [Page 2]

2. The eligibility criteria for this trial are relatively pragmatic, as they aim to include a broad range of MS patients with spasticity of the lower limbs and an EDSS score between 4 and 6.5. The exclusion criteria are also relatively pragmatic, as they only exclude patients who have received hippotherapy within the last 12 months, have a body weight over 90 kg, have no balance while sitting, or have acute exacerbation during the 4-week period before start of the therapy. This suggests that the trial is designed to include patients who are similar to those who would receive this intervention if it was part of usual care.

   Score: [4]

3. Recruitment:
   - <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The hippotherapy for patients with multiple sclerosis (MS-HIPPO) trial is primarily based on the results of Hippotherapy for patients with multiple sclerosis: A multicenter randomized controlled trial (MS-HIPPO).&quot;</span> [Page 1]
   - <span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 95.1%):

4. The recruitment process for this trial is relatively pragmatic, as it involves recruiting patients from five German centers and randomly allocating them to the intervention or control group. The trial does not appear to use any additional effort to recruit participants beyond what would be used in the usual care setting.

   Score: [5]

5. Setting:
   - <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The study was conducted at five sites in Germany, all of which have hippotherapy experience as stipulated by the rules of the German Consortium for Therapeutic Riding.&quot;</span> [Page 2]

6. The setting of the trial is relatively pragmatic, as it is conducted at five sites in Germany that have hippotherapy experience as stipulated by the rules of the German Consortium for Therapeutic Riding. This suggests that the trial is designed to use identical settings to usual care.

   Score: [5]

14. The intensity of measurement and follow-up of participants in the trial is relatively pragmatic, as it involves completing examinations and questionnaires prior to the first hippotherapy session (baseline), after 6-7 weeks (interim assessment), and after 12 weeks (final assessment). This suggests that the trial is designed to use no more than usual follow up.

    Score: [5]

16. The trial's primary outcome is relevant to participants, as it measures the change in the Berg Balance Scale (BBS) after 12 weeks. This suggests that the trial is designed to use a surrogate, physiological outcome that is of obvious importance to participants.

    Score: [5]

17. Primary analysis:

Participants: One hundred and fourteen people with progressive neurological conditions recruited from general practices in Nottingham, including 53 with Parkinson&#39;s disease and 45 with multiple sclerosis,' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;Participants were recruited from general practices in Nottingham, including 53 with Parkinson's disease and 45 with multiple sclerosis.&quot;</span>
   - <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants whose clinical features appeared incompatible with the recorded diagnosis were excluded, as were those with neurological complications of primarily non-neurological conditions or additional causes of severe disability.&quot;</span>
   - <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;In order to preserve a focus on primarily physical disabilities, dementing disorders such as Alzheimer's disease were not included.&quot;</span>

2. The eligibility criteria in this trial are relatively pragmatic, as they include adults with progressive neurological conditions who are able to participate in the intervention and follow-up assessments. However, some exclusion criteria, such as dementing disorders and neurological complications of primarily non-neurological conditions, may limit the generalizability of the trial results to a more diverse population. Additionally, the trial focuses on physical disabilities, which may further limit the applicability of the intervention to those with cognitive or other non-physical impairments. Overall, the eligibility criteria are somewhat pragmatic but may not fully reflect the diversity of individuals who would receive this intervention in a real-world setting.

   - <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;From July 1998 we approached the 177 GPs based within the City of Nottingham boundaries (population 282000). Participants eligible for inclusion were adults aged over 15 years with one of the following possible recorded diagnoses: MS, PD and other causes of progressive parkinsonism, motor neurone disease, Huntington's disease and other degenerative disorders affecting the central nervous system, muscles or peripheral nerves.&quot;</span>
   - <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;We used GP information as the sole method for identifying potential participants.&quot;</span>

4. The recruitment process in this trial is relatively pragmatic, as it involves approaching general practitioners and identifying potential participants based on their medical records. However, the trial does not specify whether any additional efforts were made to recruit participants who may not have been identified through this method, such as those who do not regularly visit their general practitioner or who have not received a formal diagnosis. Additionally, the trial does not specify whether any incentives were offered to participants or general practitioners to encourage participation. Overall, the recruitment process is somewhat pragmatic but may not fully reflect the diversity of individuals who would receive this intervention in a real-world setting.

   The eligibility criteria for this trial are relatively pragmatic, as they include patients who have been on natalizumab therapy for at least 24 months and are considering discontinuation. The exclusion criteria are also relatively pragmatic, as they only exclude patients with active disease at baseline. However, the trial does not explicitly state whether the participants are similar to those who would receive this intervention if it was part of usual care. Therefore, it is difficult to determine the exact level of pragmatism in this domain.

1. Eligibility:
   - "Fifty people with MS were randomized and completed allocated intervention (n = 26 center, n = 24 home), 47 com-
   pleted post-assessment and 44 follow-up assessment." [Page 2]
   - "Eligible participants were excluded from the study if they were already engaged in a formal exer-
   cise program lasting >30 minutes twice per week, experienced an exacerbation within the past 4 weeks, had their
   MS immunomodulation medications altered in the previ-
   ous 4 weeks or during the trial period, or declined to be
   randomly allocated." [Page 2]

   The participants in the trial are similar to those who would receive this intervention if it was part of usual care. The exclusion criteria are minimal and do not significantly limit the generalizability of the results. The trial includes people who are already engaged in exercise programs, those who have experienced exacerbations or medication changes in the past 4 weeks, and those who declined to be randomly allocated. These criteria are similar to those used in usual care.

   Score: [5]

2. Recruitment:
   - "Community dwelling people with MS were recruited
   through the Multiple Sclerosis Society of New South Wales
   and South Australia." [Page 2]
   - "Participants were assessed at two points at baseline (8 weeks apart)
   to establish stability of presentation, at the end of an
   8-week training period and at 8-week follow-up." [Page 2]

   The recruitment process is similar to that used in usual care. Participants were recruited through the Multiple Sclerosis Society of New South Wales and South Australia, and they were assessed at two points at baseline, at the end of an 8-week training period, and at 8-week follow-up. This process is similar to that used in usual care, where participants are typically recruited through healthcare providers and assessed at regular intervals.

5. Flexibility (delivery):
   - "Exercises were aimed at improving gait
   speed, endurance, and balance. They were individual-
   ized, specific, progressed in load, and performed at a
   moderate to high intensity." [Page 2]
   - "Guidelines were provided to physiotherapists
   and participants for exercises to be adapted and prog-
   ressed to suit individual functional ability via increasing
   repetitions, amplitude of movement, speed of move-
   ment, and modifying base of support." [Page 2]

   The flexibility in how the intervention is delivered is similar to that used in usual care. The exercises were individualized, specific, progressed in load, and performed at a moderate to high intensity. Guidelines were provided to physiotherapists and participants for exercises to be adapted and progressed to suit individual functional ability. This is similar to usual care, where exercises are typically individualized and progressed to suit individual functional ability.

6. Flexibility (adherence):
   - "Participants were encouraged
   to maintain their usual activity levels and engagement in
   any other exercise throughout the trial, with any varia-
   tion self-reported to the treating physiotherapist." [Page 2]

   The flexibility in how participants must adhere to the intervention is similar to that used in usual care. Participants were encouraged to maintain their usual activity levels and engagement in any other exercise throughout the trial, with any variation self-reported to the treating physiotherapist. This is similar to usual care, where participants are typically encouraged to maintain their usual activity levels and engagement in any other exercise.

   Score: [5]

7. Follow-up:
   - "Participants were assessed at two points at baseline (8 weeks apart)
   to establish stability of presentation, at the end of an
   8-week training period and at 8-week follow-up." [Page 2]

   The intensity of measurement and follow-up of participants in the trial is similar to that used in usual care. Participants were assessed at two points at baseline, at the end of an 8-week training period, and at 8-week follow-up. This is similar to usual care, where participants are typically assessed at regular intervals.

8. Primary outcome:
   - <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The primary outcome was gait speed (10-meter walk test).&quot;</span> [Page 2]

   The trial's primary outcome is relevant to participants. Gait speed is an important outcome for people with MS, as it can impact their mobility, balance, and function.

   Score: [5]

9. Primary analysis:
   - "Data were analyzed according to the intention-to-
   treat principle. Differences between groups at baseline
   were analyzed using analysis of variance (ANOVA) for
   continuous data and Mann-Whitney U tests for interval
   data. Differences in outcome measures between the
   baseline and pre-assessments were compared using paired
   samples t-tests. Data that violated normality assumptions
   were transformed for subsequent analysis. To determine
   group effects (home vs. group), time effects (pre, post,
   follow-up), and group x time interactions for the outcome
   variables, linear mixed-effects models with random slope
   (time) and covariates (baseline outcome measures) were
   performed. These analyses were repeated for subsets of
   disability levels (DS 0-2 and 3-5). All analyses were per-
   formed using the SPSS software package (version 24.0;
   SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) for Windows." [Page 3]

   All data were included in the analysis of the primary outcome. The trial used intention-to-treat analysis and included all participants who were randomized, regardless of whether they completed the intervention or not. This is similar to usual care, where all data are typically included in the analysis of the primary outcome.

18. The primary analysis in this trial is relatively pragmatic, as the sample size was determined from a paired comparison in either experimental or control group, and calculations to test whether there was a significant difference in the experimental group between zero, six and 12 months were made by repeated analysis of variance for variables that followed approximately normal distribution. The trial did not exclude ineligible post-randomisation participants, include only completers or those following the treatment protocol, or use central adjudication. Therefore, the primary analysis is likely to be similar to how the data would be analysed in a real-world setting. Score: [5]

In summary, the PRECIS-2 domains of this trial are generally pragmatic, with scores ranging from 4 to 5, indicating that the trial is likely to be similar to how the intervention would be delivered in a real-world setting. The trial includes a diverse group of patients with COPD, and the intervention is provided for 6 months with a subsequent follow-up for additional 6 months. The trial also uses research nurses to collect data, and the primary outcome is to evaluate the effectiveness of a partnership-based self-management programme for patients with mild and moderate COPD. The primary analysis is also pragmatic, using repeated analysis of variance for variables that followed approximately normal distribution. Therefore, the trial is likely to provide valuable insights into the effectiveness of the intervention in a real-world setting.</pre>

1. Eligibility:
   - <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants were randomised to either telephone review or face to face consultation with the asthma nurse.&quot;</span> [Pg. 2]
   - <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Patients were excluded if the diagnosis of asthma had been made within the previous year, if they had chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, if communication difficulties made a telephone consultation impossible, or (at the general practitioner’s request) for major social or medical reasons.&quot;</span> [Pg. 2]
   - <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants were older than the overall eligible population (mean age 55.5 versus 48.6 years; P < 0.001).&quot;</span> [Pg. 3]

2. The eligibility criteria for this trial are similar to those in usual care, with the exception of the age criteria. The trial excludes patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and communication difficulties, which are also common exclusion criteria in usual care. The trial also excludes patients at the general practitioner’s request, which is not a common exclusion criterion in usual care. However, the trial does not use any additional selection tests not used in usual care. The trial participants were slightly older than the overall eligible population, which may affect the generalizability of the results.

1. Eligibility:
   - <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants were 181 adults with RA randomly assigned to either NLC or rheumatologist-led care (RLC), both arms carrying out their normal practice.&quot;</span> [Page 1]
   - <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The primary outcome was the disease activity score (DAS28) assessed at baseline, weeks 13, 26, 39 and 52; the non-inferiority margin being DAS28 change of 0.6.&quot;</span> [Page 1]
   - <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The inclusion criteria were: a positive diagnosis of RA (1987 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria), age 18 years or older and the ability to complete questionnaires unaided.&quot;</span> [Page 2]

2. The eligibility criteria in this trial are similar to those in usual care, with participants being adults with a positive diagnosis of RA and the ability to complete questionnaires unaided. The trial does not mention any additional exclusion criteria beyond those typically used in usual care. The primary outcome is assessed using the DAS28 score, which is a common measure used in clinical practice. The non-inferiority margin of 0.6 is also a pragmatic choice, as it is a commonly used threshold in clinical trials.

   Score: [5]

3. Recruitment:

4. The recruitment process in this trial is similar to that in usual care, with patients being randomly assigned to either NLC or RLC after giving consent. The independent assessors are masked, which is a pragmatic choice to reduce bias. The joint counts and self-reported measures are also commonly used in clinical practice.

9. Flexibility (adherence):
   - <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;At one extreme, patients ineligible for any concessions were charged the standard co-payment (approximately AUD$35/month for each medication). At the other extreme, the polypill was dispensed without charge at Indigenous health services operating under the Section 100 scheme of the National Health Act.&quot;</span> [Page 3]

9. The flexibility in adherence to the intervention is pragmatic, as it allows for participants to incur out-of-pocket expenses for the polypill that are identical to those for any other drug listed in the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. The trial does not impose any additional requirements or restrictions on adherence to the intervention.

   Score: [5]

10. Follow-up:

    - <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The relative risk of self-reported use of combination treatment at study end was calculated using log-binomial regression including randomized treatment. Analyses of change in systolic BP and total cholesterol were conducted using longitudinal linear mixed models including all values collected during follow-up. Models included treatment, visit, treatment-by-visit interaction, and the baseline systolic BP or total cholesterol. Correlations between repeated measurements were modelled using a compound-symmetry structure.&quot;</span> [Page 5]

12. The primary analysis of the trial is pragmatic, as it uses standard statistical methods to calculate the relative risk of self-reported use of combination treatment and changes in systolic BP and total cholesterol.

The degree of displacement had to be sufficient for the treating surgeon to consider surgical intervention but did not have to meet the displacement criteria of Neer for inclusion in the trial.&quot;</span>
   - <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Excluded patients had associated dislocation of the injured shoulder joint, open fracture, insufficient mental capacity to understand the trial or instructions for rehabilitation, comorbidities precluding surgery or anesthesia, clear indication for surgery such as severe soft-tissue compromise, multiple injuries (upper limb fractures), pathological fracture (other than osteoporotic), terminal illness, or were not a resident in the hospital catchment area.&quot;</span>

2. Reasoning:
   The eligibility criteria for this trial are relatively pragmatic, as they allow for a wide range of patients to be included. The only specific requirement is that the patient presents within 3 weeks of sustaining a displaced fracture of the proxical humerus that involves the surgical neck. The exclusion criteria are also relatively pragmatic, as they only exclude patients who have clear contraindications for surgery or who are not residents in the hospital catchment area.

However, the full text does not provide information on the number of primary analysis methods used or the similarity of the primary analysis methods to those used in usual care, making it difficult to accurately assess the pragmatism of the primary analysis domain.

1. Eligibility:
   - <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;People with multiple sclerosis were screened on the General Health Questionnaire 12 and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, and those with low mood were recruited.&quot;</span> [Pg. 2]
   - <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants were included who scored >2 on the General Health Questionnaire 12, 7 on the anxiety and depression subscales of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale.&quot;</span> [Pg. 3]
   - <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Those who were not able to complete the outcome measures, such as people with visual problems, were visited by a researcher who was unaware of their group allocation, who completed the questionnaires with them.&quot;</span> [Pg. 4]

2. The eligibility criteria in this trial are relatively pragmatic, as they focus on low mood, which is a common symptom in multiple sclerosis patients. The screening process is straightforward and does not involve any complex or invasive tests. Additionally, the researchers made an effort to accommodate participants who were unable to complete the outcome measures themselves. However, the exclusion of people with visual problems may limit the generalizability of the trial results. Score: [4]

3. Recruitment:
   - <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants were recruited for a randomized trial of adjustment groups for people with multiple sclerosis and low mood between June 2008 and September 2009.&quot;</span> [Pg. 3]

1. Eligibility:

   Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The inclusion criteria were being definitely diagnosed with MS and having records in the Society and the exclusion criteria having history of other psychiatric disorders including major depressive disorder (according to the medical records and the physician's examinations) or bipolar disorder (except for cognitive disorders by which MS is characterized), substance dependency, any neurological disorders, history of taking corticosteroids or the disease recurrence within the previous six months.&quot;</span>

   Explanation: The inclusion and exclusion criteria for the study are quite specific, but they do not seem to deviate significantly from what would be used in usual care. The criteria are based on medical records and physician examinations, which suggests that they are evidence-based and clinically relevant. However, the criteria are not overly restrictive, as they allow for a range of MS patients to be included in the study. Overall, the eligibility criteria seem to be fairly pragmatic, with a score of <span style='background-color: #ff9e81' title='Added score prefix during extraction'>Score: [4]</span>.

2. Recruitment:

   Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Because the patients were not hospitalized and regularly referred to the Association, to follow randomized assignment, we decided to run the sampling within two consecutive months until we enrolled an adequate number of participants. Accordingly, 70 numbers, equal to the number of people required in each group, were developed and the numbers 1e70 were randomly assigned to two groups: experimental and control. After eligible patients referred to the Association, a number was randomly assigned to each patient according to his/her referring time and the patients were assigned to the two groups.&quot;</span>

   Explanation: The recruitment process for the study appears to be quite pragmatic. The researchers used a simple randomization method to assign patients to the experimental or control group, which is a common and straightforward approach. The fact that patients were not hospitalized and regularly referred to the Association suggests that the recruitment process may have been similar to what would be used in usual care. However, it is unclear whether any extra effort was made to recruit participants beyond what would be typical in usual care. Therefore, a score of <span style='background-color: #ff9e81' title='Added score prefix during extraction'>Score: [3]</span> is appropriate for the recruitment domain.

3. Setting:

   Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The intervention was implemented within two days a week. For the control group, a routine protocol was conducted. For blinding, the patients of the control group referred to the Society on certain days of week and those of the experimental on other days.&quot;</span>

   Explanation: The setting of the study appears to be quite pragmatic, as the intervention was implemented in a community-based setting that is similar to what would be used in usual care. The researchers used a simple blinding method to ensure that the control group was not aware of the intervention, which is a common and straightforward approach. However, it is unclear whether the setting of the study differed significantly from the usual care setting. Therefore, a score of <span style='background-color: #ff9e81' title='Added score prefix during extraction'>Score: [4]</span> is appropriate for the setting domain.

4. Organization:

   Quote: <span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 99.9%):

The intervention consisted of: defining depression, stress, anxiety, and their symptoms, defining happiness, and explaining its necessity, reviewing the results of previous studies on happiness (the first session); the technique of increasing physical activity, the technique of being productive, and doing useful and meaningful things (the second session); the principles of planning and better organization–the technique of removing concerns, the technique of reducing expectations and wishes (the third session); the technique of enhancing creativity, the technique of living at present (the F. Khayeri et al. / Complementary Therapies in Clinical Practice 25 (2016) 130e135 131 fourth session; the technique of increasing social relationships, the technique of being the real self (the fifth session).

   Explanation: The organization of the intervention appears to be quite pragmatic, as it is based on a structured curriculum that is designed to teach patients specific skills and techniques for managing their depression, stress, anxiety, and fatigue. The intervention is delivered in eight sessions, which is a reasonable length of time for a behavioral intervention. The intervention is also delivered in a group format, which is a common and cost-effective approach. However, it is unclear whether the organization of the intervention differs significantly from what would be used in usual care. Therefore, a score of <span style='background-color: #ff9e81' title='Added score prefix during extraction'>Score: [4]</span> is appropriate for the organization domain.

   Explanation: The flexibility of the intervention appears to be quite pragmatic, as it is based on a structured curriculum that is designed to teach patients specific skills and techniques for managing their depression, stress, anxiety, and fatigue. The intervention is delivered in eight sessions, which is a reasonable length of time for a behavioral intervention. The intervention is also delivered in a group format, which is a common and cost-effective approach. However, it is unclear whether the flexibility of the intervention differs significantly from what would be used in usual care. Therefore, a score of <span style='background-color: #ff9e81' title='Added score prefix during extraction'>Score: [4]</span> is appropriate for the flexibility (delivery) domain.

6. Flexibility (adherence):

   Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;At completion of the training program, all happy techniques were briefly reviewed with the participants, the participants were asked some questions about their current happiness and optimism levels, and their questions, if any, were answered. Then, DASS-21 and Piper Scale were administered to the participants.&quot;</span>

   Explanation: The flexibility of adherence to the intervention appears to be quite pragmatic, as the researchers did not exclude any participants based on their adherence to the intervention. The researchers also reviewed the happy techniques with the participants at the end of the training program and asked them about their current happiness and optimism levels. This suggests that the researchers were flexible in their approach to adherence and were willing to work with participants to ensure that they were able to benefit from the intervention. However, it is unclear whether the flexibility of adherence differed significantly from what would be used in usual care. Therefore, a score of <span style='background-color: #ff9e81' title='Added score prefix during extraction'>Score: [4]</span> is appropriate for the flexibility (adherence) domain.

7. Follow-up:

   Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;At completion of the training program, all happy techniques were briefly reviewed with the participants, the participants were asked some questions about their current happiness and optimism levels, and their questions, if any, were answered. Then, DASS-21 and Piper Scale were administered to the participants. The participants were acknowledged for their participation in the study and the follow-up session was decided to be held three months later. Moreover, to investigate the efficacy of the FHM, the DASS-21 and Piper Standard Scale were administered to the experimental group in the follow-up session.&quot;</span>

   Explanation: The follow-up process for the study appears to be quite pragmatic, as the researchers administered the DASS-21 and Piper Standard Scale to the experimental group in a follow-up session that was held three months after the completion of the training program. This is a reasonable length of time for a follow-up period, as it allows for enough time to assess the long-term effects of the intervention. The fact that the researchers administered the same measures in the follow-up session that were used in the initial assessment also suggests that the follow-up process is consistent with what would be used in usual care. Therefore, a score of <span style='background-color: #ff9e81' title='Added score prefix during extraction'>Score: [4]</span> is appropriate for the follow-up domain.

8. Primary outcome:

   Explanation: The primary outcome of the study appears to be quite pragmatic, as it is focused on depression, stress, anxiety, and fatigue, which are common symptoms experienced by MS patients. The fact that the researchers used validated measures (DASS-21 and Piper Standard Scale) to assess these symptoms also suggests that the primary outcome is consistent with what would be used in usual care. However, it is unclear whether the primary outcome differs significantly from what would be used in usual care. Therefore, a score of <span style='background-color: #ff9e81' title='Added score prefix during extraction'>Score: [4]</span> is appropriate for the primary outcome domain.

   Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The data obtained before and after conduction of the program were analyzed by chi-square test, Mann-Whitney, covariance statistics, repeated measures ANOVA, and independent t-test in SPSS 18.&quot;</span>

   Explanation: The primary analysis of the study appears to be quite pragmatic, as the researchers used a range of statistical tests to analyze the data. The fact that the researchers used SPSS 18, which is a commonly used statistical software package, also suggests that the primary analysis is consistent with what would be used in usual care. However, it is unclear whether the primary analysis differs significantly from what would be used in usual care. Therefore, a score of <span style='background-color: #ff9e81' title='Added score prefix during extraction'>Score: [4]</span> is appropriate for the primary analysis domain.

Overall, the PRECIS-2 domains for this study appear to be fairly pragmatic, with scores ranging from 3 to 5. The eligibility, setting, and primary outcome domains received the highest scores, while the recruitment and primary analysis domains received the lowest scores. This suggests that the study is generally consistent with what would be used in usual care, but there may be some areas where the study could be improved to make it more pragmatic. For example, the researchers could consider using more convenient recruitment methods or using more straightforward statistical analyses to make the study more pragmatic.</pre>

1. Eligibility:
   - <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Patients were recruited in collaboration with six Danish regional MS clinics and The Danish MS Society. Inclusion criteria were (1) 18–60 years of age, (2) ⩽2 years since clinical diagnosis with relapsing remitting MS (RRMS) and (3) no relapses or changes in medication status 8 weeks prior to inclusion.&quot;</span> [Page 1621]
   - <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Eligibility was confirmed by project nurses based on patients’ medical records. Patients gave informed written consent prior to inclusion.&quot;</span> [Page 1621]

2. The eligibility criteria for this trial are relatively pragmatic, as they only require a recent diagnosis of RRMS and no relapses or medication changes in the past 8 weeks. The age range is also quite broad, which increases the generalizability of the trial. However, the fact that patients were recruited through MS clinics and the Danish MS Society may introduce some selection bias, as these patients may be more motivated or have more severe symptoms than the general MS population. Additionally, the requirement for written consent may exclude some patients who are unable to provide it. Overall, I would rate the eligibility domain as moderately pragmatic: Score: [4]

3. Recruitment:
   - <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Patients were recruited in collaboration with six Danish regional MS clinics and The Danish MS Society.&quot;</span> [Page 1621]

None of the dropouts were, to the knowledge of the authors, related to the exercise intervention.' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: red'>&quot;The flow of patients through the different study phases is presented in Figure 1. None of the dropouts were, to the knowledge of the authors, related to the exercise intervention.&quot;</span> [Page 1623]

4. The recruitment process for this trial is relatively pragmatic, as it involves collaboration with multiple MS clinics and the Danish MS Society to reach a diverse group of patients. The fact that none of the dropouts were related to the exercise intervention suggests that the recruitment process was successful in identifying patients who were willing and able to participate in the trial. However, the full text does not provide enough information to determine whether any extra effort was made to recruit participants beyond what would be used in the usual care setting. Therefore, I would rate the recruitment domain as moderately pragmatic: Score: [3]

5. Setting:
   - <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The study period covers 48 weeks with outcome assessment at baseline (T0), after 24 weeks (T24), and after 48 weeks (T48).&quot;</span> [Page 1621]

6. The setting of this trial is relatively pragmatic, as it involves a single location and a consistent MRI scanner for all timepoints. The 48-week study period is also similar to the duration of many other clinical trials. However, the full text does not provide enough information to determine whether the setting is identical to the usual care setting. Therefore, I would rate the setting domain as moderately pragmatic: Score: [3]

7. Organization:
   - <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The supervised exercise sessions were performed twice weekly for the full study period of 48 weeks, and was planned on the basis of four principles (adapted from Stathopoulos and Felson Duchan) 13: (1) individual tailoring, (2) application of exercise types matching the goal of the intervention, (3) progressive overload and (4) sufficient intensity to induce the desired effects of the intervention.&quot;</span> [Page 1622]

8. The organization of this trial is relatively pragmatic, as it involves a consistent exercise intervention that is tailored to individual patients and progressively overloaded over time. The fact that the exercise intervention is performed in addition to usual care also increases the generalizability of the trial. However, the full text does not provide enough information to determine whether the resources, provider expertise, and organization of care delivery in the intervention arm of the trial are identical to those available in usual care. Therefore, I would rate the organization domain as moderately pragmatic: Score: [3]

10. The flexibility of the exercise intervention in this trial is relatively pragmatic, as it allows for individual tailoring and progressive overload over time. The fact that the intervention is based on high-intensity aerobic exercise also increases the generalizability of the trial. However, the full text does not provide enough information to determine whether there is a strict protocol, monitoring, or measures to improve compliance in the intervention arm of the trial. Therefore, I would rate the flexibility (delivery) domain as moderately pragmatic: Score: [3]

11. Flexibility (adherence):

   - <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The purpose of providing health educational sessions were primarily to facilitate adherence in the control group, as a previous study showed no effect of health education on MS-related symptoms and a null effect on the outcomes of the present study was therefore expected.&quot;</span> [Page 1622]

12. The flexibility of adherence in this trial is relatively pragmatic, as it allows for individual tailoring and progressive overload over time. The fact that the intervention is based on high-intensity aerobic exercise also increases the generalizability of the trial. However, the full text does not provide enough information to determine whether there is a strict protocol, monitoring, or measures to improve compliance in the intervention arm of the trial.

   - <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Global brain atrophy rate was quantified by the two most common methods found in the MS literature. First, as percentage brain volume change (PBVC) determined by the automated longitudinal brain change analysis tool, SIENA, part of FSL, 15 using improved brain masks 16 and second as percentage change of brain parenchymal fraction (BPF).&quot;</span> [Page 1622]

14. The follow-up process in this trial is relatively pragmatic, as it involves consistent MRI scans at multiple timepoints. The fact that the scans are performed using the same MRI scanner and location for all patients also increases the generalizability of the trial. However, the full text does not provide enough information to determine whether the intensity of measurement and follow-up of participants in the trial is identical to the likely follow-up in usual care. Therefore, I would rate the follow-up domain as moderately pragmatic: Score: [3]

15. Primary outcome:
   - <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The relapse rate and the global brain atrophy rate were the primary outcomes of this study.&quot;</span> [Page 1623]
   - <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The number of relapses in the study period was obtained from the medical records of the included patients in the RCT by project nurses (blinded to group allocation) and from The Danish MS Registry for the population-based control group. All relapses were confirmed by neurologists (also blinded to group allocation) according to the guidelines from the Danish National Neurological Association.&quot;</span> [Page 1623]

16. The primary outcome of this trial is relatively pragmatic, as it focuses on the relapse rate and global brain atrophy rate, which are both important outcomes in MS research. The fact that the relapse rate is obtained from medical records and confirmed by neurologists also increases the generalizability of the trial. However, the full text does not provide enough information to determine whether the trial's primary outcome is relevant to participants or whether it is measured at an earlier time than in usual care. Therefore, I would rate the primary outcome domain as moderately pragmatic: Score: [3]

17. Primary analysis:
   - <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;A Poisson regression controlling for a priori defined potential confounding variables (age, gender and time since diagnosis) and expressed as an incidence-rate-ratio was applied to compare the annual relapse rate between the RCT groups.&quot;</span> [Page 1624]
   - <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Only for the two RCT groups, a multivariate repeated measurements mixed effects regression model was used to analyse longitudinal data with time and group as fixed effects. Time is incorporated in PBVC as a result of the SIENA analysis, and the model for this outcome therefore only included group as fixed effect.&quot;</span> [Page 1624]

18. The primary analysis of this trial is relatively pragmatic, as it uses a Poisson regression and a multivariate repeated measurements mixed effects regression model to compare the annual relapse rate between the RCT groups. The fact that the analysis controls for potential confounding variables also increases the generalizability of the trial. However, the full text does not provide enough information to determine whether all data are included in the analysis of the primary outcome. Therefore, I would rate the primary analysis domain as moderately pragmatic: Score: [3]

Overall, the PRECIS-2 domains for this trial are moderately pragmatic, with scores ranging from 3 to 4. The eligibility, recruitment, and primary outcome domains are relatively pragmatic, while the setting, organization, flexibility (delivery), flexibility (adherence), follow-up, primary analysis, and recruitment domains are moderately pragmatic. The flexibility (delivery) and flexibility (adherence) domains are the least pragmatic, as the full text does not provide enough information to determine whether there is a strict protocol, monitoring, or measures to improve compliance in the intervention arm of the trial. However, the trial is still relatively pragmatic overall, as it focuses on important outcomes in MS research and involves a consistent exercise intervention that is tailored to individual patients and progressively overloaded over time.</pre>

2. The eligibility criteria for this trial are very strict and exclude many patients who would receive this intervention if it was part of usual care. The trial only includes patients who can walk with or without walking aids, and excludes patients with diabetes mellitus, hypertension, psychiatric illness, or peptic ulcer. Additionally, a glucose-tolerance test is required before starting the treatment. These criteria are not representative of the typical patient population with multiple sclerosis and are therefore very explanatory.

   Score: [1]

3. Recruitment:

4. The recruitment for this trial is moderately explanatory. While the trial is conducted in multiple centers, it is not a double-blind study and therefore may be subject to bias. Additionally, the fact that similar studies were carried out at the same time in three cities and could control one another suggests that extra effort was made to recruit participants.

   Score: [3]

5. Setting:
   - <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The treated group were given corticotrophin (’ Acthar ’ gel) in a dosage which varied between 15 and 25 units daily, potassium chloride orally, and a low-salt diet.&quot;</span> [3]

8. The organization of this trial is moderately explanatory. The trial uses a specific treatment protocol and includes a control group that receives a placebo injection. However, the trial does not specify the resources, provider expertise, or organization of care delivery in the intervention arm of the trial.

   Score: [3]

9. Flexibility (delivery):
   - <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The dose of corticotrophin was adjusted to produce just enough 'mooning' of the face to be appreciated by the physician in charge of the trial and the dose was not increased during a relapse.&quot;</span> [4]

10. The flexibility in how the intervention is delivered in this trial is moderately pragmatic. The dose of corticotrophin is adjusted to produce a specific effect and is not increased during a relapse. Additionally, X-rays are taken at specific intervals to monitor for osteoporosis. However, the trial does not specify whether there are any measures to improve compliance or specific advice on allowed co-interventions and complications.

12. The flexibility in how participants must adhere to the intervention in this trial is moderately pragmatic. The trial only includes patients who have relapsed in the previous eighteen months and uses a specific treatment protocol. However, the trial does not specify whether there are any measures to improve adherence if found wanting.

For inclusion and exclusion criteria, see LangeskovChristensen et al. 24 At inclusion, a neurologist examined participants to determine the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score, unless a recent score (<6 months) followed by a disease stable period existed.' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;Eighty-six participants were recruited from Danish MS clinics (Aarhus University Hospital, Viborg Regional Hospital, Odense University Hospital, and the MS Clinic of Southern Jutland (Kolding)). For inclusion and exclusion criteria, see Langeskov-Christensen et al. (24). At inclusion, a neurologist examined participants to determine the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score, unless a recent score (<6 months) followed by a disease stable period existed.&quot;</span>

   Reasoning: The inclusion criteria are not specified in the full text, but it is mentioned that participants were recruited from MS clinics and examined by a neurologist to determine the EDSS score. This suggests that the participants in the trial are similar to those who would receive this intervention if it was part of usual care, indicating a pragmatic approach. However, the full text does not provide enough information to determine the extent of similarity between the trial participants and those in usual care.

   Score: [4]

2. Recruitment:

   Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants were recruited between April 2016 and October 2017. From a total of 148 patients invited to participate, 86 were enrolled.&quot;</span>

   Reasoning: The full text does not provide enough information to determine the extent of extra effort made to recruit participants over and above what would be used in the usual care setting.

   Score: [NA]

3. Setting:

   Quote: <span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 99.4%):

Supervised PAE sessions were conducted twice weekly during the 24 weeks, with one continuous and one interval exercise session performed each week. In brief, the session volume increased from 30 to 60 minutes during the intervention while the intensity M Langeskov-Christensen, LG Hvid et al. journals.sagepub.com/home/msj 3 increased from 65% to 95% of individual maximum heart rate (HR max ).

For further details on exercise modality options and the progressing volume and intensity of the exercise sessions, see Langeskov-Christensen et al. (23).&quot;</span>

   Reasoning: The setting of the trial is a supervised exercise intervention, which is similar to the usual care setting where exercise is often supervised by a healthcare professional. The trial uses identical settings to usual care, indicating a pragmatic approach.

   Score: [5]

4. Organization:

   Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The present study conforms to the CONSORT 2010 guidelines. It represents secondary data analysis from a randomized controlled trial investigating the effects of aerobic exercise on brain health and cognition in pwMS. This trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02661555).&quot;</span>

   Reasoning: The trial is a randomized controlled trial, which is a common and well-established research design in the field of clinical trials. The trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, indicating that the trial is conducted in a transparent and accountable manner. This suggests that the resources, provider expertise, and organization of care delivery in the intervention arm of the trial are similar to those available in usual care, indicating a pragmatic approach.

For further details on exercise modality options and the progressing volume and intensity of the exercise sessions, see Langeskov-Christensen et al. (23).&quot;</span>

   Reasoning: The trial uses a structured exercise intervention with a fixed volume and intensity, which is similar to the usual care setting where exercise is often structured and supervised by a healthcare professional. The trial does not allow for much flexibility in how the intervention is delivered, indicating a less pragmatic approach.

   Score: [2]

6. Flexibility (adherence):

   Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Exercise adherence was high with 44.8 ± 2.6 completed sessions, corresponding to 93.3 ± 5.4% of the planned sessions.&quot;</span>

   Reasoning: The trial measures exercise adherence and reports a high level of adherence, indicating that participants are encouraged to adhere to the intervention. However, the full text does not provide enough information to determine the extent of flexibility in how participants must adhere to the intervention and the flexibility likely in usual care.

   Score: [NA]

7. Follow-up:

   Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;At baseline (T0), after 24 (T24) and after 48 (T48) weeks, participants performed the BRB-N, the Major Depression Inventory (MDI), and a cardiorespiratory fitness test (VO2-max test). Each test session was separated by at least 48 hours from the last exercise bout.&quot;</span>

   Reasoning: The trial measures cognitive performance, depression score, and cardiorespiratory fitness at multiple time points, indicating a pragmatic approach. However, the full text does not provide enough information to determine the intensity of measurement and follow-up of participants in the trial and the likely follow-up in usual care.

   Score: [NA]

8. Primary outcome:

2. The eligibility criteria for this trial are relatively pragmatic, as they allow for a broad range of patients with relapsing forms of MS to participate, including those with an inadequate response to or inability to tolerate one or more therapies for MS. However, the exclusion criteria are quite extensive and specific, which may limit the generalizability of the trial results to a wider population. Additionally, the requirement for patients to be naïve to fingolimod treatment suggests a more explanatory approach. Overall, the eligibility criteria appear to strike a balance between pragmatism and explanatory rigor, with a slight lean towards the latter. Score: [3]

4. The recruitment process for this trial appears to be relatively pragmatic, as it involves recruiting patients from both the USA and Canada, and randomizing them to either fingolimod or an iDMT without any intervening washout period. The fact that patients were allowed to switch immediately to another approved iDMT suggests a more pragmatic approach. However, the specific inclusion and exclusion criteria may have influenced the recruitment process and limited the generalizability of the trial results. Overall, the recruitment process appears to be moderately pragmatic. Score: [4]

6. The setting of this trial appears to be relatively pragmatic, as it involves multiple centers in the USA and Canada, and was conducted in a real-world scenario without any blinding or placebo control. However, the trial was still conducted under the supervision of an institutional review board and required written informed consent from every patient, which suggests a more explanatory approach.

12. The flexibility of this trial appears to be relatively pragmatic, as it allows for patients to switch immediately to another approved iDMT if necessary. However, the specific inclusion and exclusion criteria, as well as the requirement for patients to be naïve to fingolimod treatment, suggest a more explanatory approach. Additionally, the fact that patients were required to have received a single iDMT continuously for at least 6 months prior to study initiation and to be candidates for therapy change may have influenced the flexibility of the trial. Overall, the flexibility of the trial appears to be moderately pragmatic. Score: [4]

<pre>
1. Eligibility:

   Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;All participants were recruited among six MS rehabilitation centers within the region of Castilla y Le´on (Spain)&quot;</span> [...] <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot; After a medical evaluation that confirmed patients’ aptitude and absence of contraindications to carry out the procedures involved in the study, subjects signed a written informed consent form to participate.&quot;</span>

   Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants were randomly assigned to two different groups, the exercise group (EG) or the control group (CG). The EG, which included 16 women and 14 men (49.6 ± 11.0 yr), performed 12 weeks of resistance training followed by a detraining period where resistance exercise or other structured physical activity was avoided. The CG, which did not follow any resistance training during the study period, included 7 women and 5 men (46.2 ± 7.5 yr).&quot;</span>

   Reasoning: The eligibility criteria for this trial are similar to those used in usual care, with participants being recruited from MS rehabilitation centers and undergoing a medical evaluation to confirm their aptitude for the study. The random assignment of participants to either the exercise or control group also increases the pragmatism of the trial. However, the exclusion of participants with contraindications to the study procedures may limit the generalizability of the trial to a wider population of MS patients. Score: [4]

2. Recruitment:

   Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;After a group meeting where the details of the investigation were described to the patients, including possible risks and discomfort associated to the intervention, a formal invitation to take part in the study was offered.&quot;</span>

   Reasoning: The recruitment process for this trial is similar to that used in usual care, with patients being informed about the study and invited to participate. However, the use of a group meeting to provide information about the study may limit the pragmatism of the trial, as this approach may not be feasible in a usual care setting. Score: [3]

3. Setting:

   Quote: <span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 97.4%):

performed 12 weeks of resistance training followed by a detraining period where resistance exercise or other structured physical activity was avoided. The CG, which did not follow any resistance training during the study period,' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;The EG performed 12 weeks of resistance training followed by a detraining period where resistance exercise or other structured physical activity was avoided. The CG did not follow any resistance training during the study period.&quot;</span>

   Reasoning: The setting of this trial is similar to that used in usual care, with participants performing resistance training or not, depending on their group assignment. However, the use of a controlled research setting may limit the pragmatism of the trial, as it may not reflect the variability and unpredictability of a usual care setting. Score: [3]

4. Organization:

   Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;All testing procedures were selected according to previous studies&quot;</span> [...] <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot; Each participant completed the tests in a single session. Subjects were individually informed about the test procedures before initiating them.&quot;</span>

   Reasoning: The organization of this trial is similar to that used in usual care, with participants undergoing testing procedures that are selected based on previous studies. The individualized nature of the testing procedures also increases the pragmatism of the trial. However, the use of a controlled research setting may limit the generalizability of the trial to a wider population of MS patients. Score: [4]

5. Flexibility (delivery):

   Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Subjects performed coupled concentric-eccentric bilateral seated knee extension training using a weight stack machine&quot;</span> [...] <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot; The patients were continuously supervised by physical therapists.&quot;</span>

   Reasoning: The flexibility in the delivery of the intervention in this trial is similar to that used in usual care, with participants performing resistance training using a weight stack machine and being supervised by physical therapists. However, the use of a controlled research setting may limit the pragmatism of the trial, as it may not reflect the variability and unpredictability of a usual care setting. Score: [4]

6. Flexibility (adherence):

   Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Adherence to the training intervention (e.g. EG) averaged 22.9 ± 1.5 sessions from a total of 24 planned sessions&quot;</span> [...] <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot; All participants from the EG completed more than 75% of the sessions included in the resistance training program.&quot;</span>

   Reasoning: The flexibility in adherence to the intervention in this trial is similar to that used in usual care, with participants being encouraged to complete as many sessions as possible. The high adherence rate of the EG also increases the pragmatism of the trial. However, the use of a controlled research setting may limit the generalizability of the trial to a wider population of MS patients. Score: [4]

7. Follow-up:

   Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Testing was performed on three different occasions: before (week 0) and after (week 12) the training program, and after the detraining period (week 24).&quot;</span>

   Reasoning: The follow-up procedures in this trial are similar to those used in usual care, with participants undergoing testing at multiple time points. However, the use of a controlled research setting may limit the pragmatism of the trial, as it may not reflect the variability and unpredictability of a usual care setting. Score: [4]

8. Primary outcome:

   Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The EG increased MVIC and muscle power after the training period, although the training did not affect muscle endurance. After 12 weeks of detraining, MVIC returned to pre-training values but muscle power was still greater than pre-training values in the EG.&quot;</span>

   Reasoning: The primary outcome of this trial is relevant to participants, as it demonstrates the effects of resistance training and detraining on muscle strength and power in MS patients. However, the use of a controlled research setting may limit the pragmatism of the trial, as it may not reflect the variability and unpredictability of a usual care setting. Score: [4]

9. Primary analysis:

   Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Two-way ANOVA with repeated measurements for group and time&quot;</span> [...] <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot; Bonferroni post-hoc comparisons.&quot;</span>

   Reasoning: The primary analysis of this trial is similar to that used in usual care, with statistical tests being used to compare the effects of the intervention between groups and time points. However, the use of a controlled research setting may limit the pragmatism of the trial, as it may not reflect the variability and unpredictability of a usual care setting. Score: [4]

You are an expert in clinical trial design and are tasked to assess the PRECIS-2 scores of a trial based on the full text of its publication. You have the following briefing:

# PRECIS-2 Domains
* Eligibility: To what extent are the participants in the trial similar to those who would receive this intervention if it was part of usual care? For example, score 5 for very pragmatic criteria essentially identical to those in usual care; score 1 for a very explanatory approach with lots of exclusions (e.g. those who don’t comply, respond to treatment, or are not at high risk for primary outcome, are children or elderly), or uses many selection tests not used in usual care.
* Recruitment: How much extra effort is made to recruit participants over and above what that would be used in the usual care setting to engage with patients? For example, score 5 for very pragmatic recruitment through usual appointments or clinic; score 1 for a very explanatory approach with targeted invitation letters, advertising in newspapers, radio plus incentives and other routes that would not be used in usual care.
* Setting: How different is the setting of the trial and the usual care setting? For example, score 5 for a very pragmatic choice using identical settings to usual care; score 1, for a very explanatory approach with only a single centre, or only specialised trial or academic centres.
* Organisation: How different are the resources, provider expertise and the organisation of care delivery in the intervention arm of the trial and those available in usual care? For example, score 5 for a very pragmatic choice that uses identical organisation to usual care; score 1 for a very explanatory approach if the trial increases staff levels, gives additional training, require more than usual experience or certification and increase resources.
* Flexibility (delivery): How different is the flexibility in how the intervention is delivered and the flexibility likely in usual care? For example, score 5 for a very pragmatic choice with identical flexibility to usual care; score 1 for a very explanatory approach if there is a strict protocol, monitoring and measures to improve compliance, with specific advice on allowed co-interventions and complications.
* Flexibility (adherence): How different is the flexibility in how participants must adhere to the intervention and the flexibility likely in usual care? For example, score 5 for a very pragmatic choice involving no more than usual encouragement to adhere to the intervention; score 1 for a very explanatory approach that involves exclusion based on adherence, and measures to improve adherence if found wanting. In some trials eg surgical trials where patients are being operated on or Intensive Care Unit trials where patients are being given IV drug therapy, this domain is not applicable as there is no compliance issue after consent has been given, so this score should be left blank.
* Follow-up: How different is the intensity of measurement and follow-up of participants in the trial and the likely follow-up in usual care? For example, score 5 for a very pragmatic approach with no more than usual follow up; score 1 for a very explanatory approach with more frequent, longer visits, unscheduled visits triggered by primary outcome event or intervening event, and more extensive data collection.
* Primary outcome: To what extent is the trial's primary outcome relevant to participants? For example, score 5 for a very pragmatic choice where the outcome is of obvious importance to participants; score 1 for a very explanatory approach using a surrogate, physiological outcome, central adjudication or use assessment expertise that is not available in usual care, or the outcome is measured at an earlier time than in usual care.
* Primary analysis: To what extent are all data included in the analysis of the primary outcome? For example, score 5 for a very pragmatic approach using intention to treat with all available data; score 1 for a very explanatory analysis that excludes ineligible post-randomisation participants, includes only completers or those following the treatment protocol.

For each of the 9 domains of PRECIS-2, perform the following steps:
1. Extract 1-3 relevant quotes from the full text.
2. Explain your reasoning in 1 paragraph.
3. Give a score X from 1 (very explanatory) to 5 (very pragmatic) in square brackets like this: "Score: [X]". If the full text does not contain enough information to assess a specific domain, report "Score: [NA]".

Do not provide a final summary paragraph in the end.
