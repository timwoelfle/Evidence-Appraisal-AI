Eligibility for inclusion as a trial intervention was based on a range of criteria including the clinical importance of resolving the uncertainty for short-term and long-term Lancet 2013; 382: 234–48 Published Online May 28, 2013 http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/ S0140-6736(13)60441-9 This publication has been corrected.

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The CORONIS trial is registered with Current Controlled Trials: ISRCTN31089967.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: The eligibility criteria seem quite broad and pragmatic, aiming to resolve clinical uncertainties that are important for real-world outcomes. The trial was registered in a public database. However, some specific criteria were considered like feasibility of the interventions in the participating countries, which adds a slight explanatory angle.
Score: [4]

Recruitment:
Quotes: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Between May 20, 2007, and Dec 31, 2010, 15 935 women were recruited. There were no statistically significant differences within any of the intervention pairs for the primary outcome: blunt versus sharp entry risk ratio 1·03 (95% CI 0·91–1·17), exterior versus intra-abdominal repair 0·96 (0·84–1·08), single-layer versus double-layer closure 0·96 (0·85–1·08), closure versus non-closure 1·06 (0·94–1·20), and chromic catgut versus polyglactin-910 0·90 (0·78–1·04).&quot;</span>
Reasoning: The recruitment period was over 3.5 years and a very large sample of 15,935 women were recruited. No additional details are provided on the recruitment methods. Given the large sample size recruited over a long period, the recruitment approach seems to be on the pragmatic end, without utilizing special recruitment efforts that would not be done in usual care.
Score: [4]

Setting:
Quotes: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;CORONIS was a pragmatic international 2×2×2×2×2 non-regular fractional, factorial, unmasked, randomised controlled trial that examined five elements of the caesarean section technique in intervention pairs.&quot;</span>

C. Discussion CORONIS was a large randomised trial of caesarean section surgical techniques' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: red'>&quot;After widespread consultation and agreement at a workshop in Oxford, UK, to discuss the protocol for a randomised trial of caesarean section surgical techniques (CORONIS), five pairs of interventions were chosen.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: The trial was conducted in an international setting across multiple countries. The interventions were agreed upon through consultation at an international workshop. This suggests the setting had similarities to usual care, by conducting the trial in diverse real-world locations. However, the international coordination and protocol agreement workshop add some explanatory elements.
Score: [4] 

Organization:
Quotes: <span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 99.2%):

The trial was overseen by an independent trial steering commit tee. An independent data monitoring committee monitored effectiveness and safety annually. The data monitoring committee used the Haybittle–Peto 11,12 approach for interim analyses using three standard errors as the cutoff for consideration of early cessation, preserving the type-one error rate across the trial.' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;The trial was overseen by an independent trial steering committee. An independent data monitoring committee monitored effectiveness and safety annually. The data monitoring committee used the Haybittle–Peto14,15 approach to interim analyses using three standard errors as the cutoff for consideration of early cessation, preserving the type-one error rate across the trial.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: The trial had an independent steering committee and data monitoring committee that reviewed safety and effectiveness, which suggests increased resources and organization compared to usual care. However, the committees only reviewed data annually, which is not an overly intensive monitoring approach. The organization seems to have both pragmatic and explanatory aspects.

Flexibility (delivery):
Quotes: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;All investigators, surgeons, and participants were unmasked to treatment allocation.&quot;</span>
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Each regional coordinator (one per country, except India, which was split into two regions) started and documented a training programme that ensured that surgeons operating within the trial were familiar with the techniques being compared before participating.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: The trial was unmasked, allowing flexibility similar to usual care. However, surgeons underwent a training program to ensure they were familiar with the techniques before participating, which is a more explanatory approach to intervention delivery.

Follow-up:
Quotes: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Data were collected at trial entry, immediately after surgery, at hospital discharge (including hospital transfer or death), and at 6 weeks after delivery. Women who did not return at 6 weeks were located and interviewed by telephone or during a home visit. Serious adverse events were assessed by the chief investigator and data monitoring committee as soon as they were reported to the international coordinating centre.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: Follow-up data collection occurred at several time points, including trial entry, immediately post-surgery, at discharge, and at 6 weeks postpartum. Efforts were made to locate and interview women who did not return at 6 weeks. Serious adverse events were assessed as soon as reported. This represents a more intensive follow-up than usual care, but not excessively so.

Reasoning: The primary outcome is a composite of several important clinical outcomes that would be relevant to patients. However, it includes some explanatory elements like blood transfusion of >1 unit. The primary analysis focused on the main effects of the intervention pairs, with interactions only planned if significant differences were seen, which is a more explanatory approach.

Additionally, no interaction tests were done as there was no evidence of main effects, suggesting the analysis plan had some explanatory constraints.

GPs were asked to participate in the SMS project. Their PNs for diabetes care were randomly assigned to an intervention or control arm.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: The eligibility criteria were quite broad, including all family practices in one regional organization. GPs were asked to participate, and their practice nurses were then randomized. This is a fairly pragmatic approach, although limited to a specific region. There were no additional inclusion or exclusion criteria reported.
Score: [4]

Recruitment:
Quotes: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Practice nurses (PNs) in the Netherlands work according to guidelines that focus on medical and behavioural management. Furthermore, the financial reimbursement of care and patients' health outcomes are determined by biomedical targets.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: Recruitment occurred through the existing system of practice nurses working in family practices in the Netherlands. This is the same way patients would be recruited in usual care, so the approach is very pragmatic.

The starting point was a nurse-led minimal psychological intervention. A previous randomised trial has shown that this intervention was cost-effective for patients with diabetes with minor to moderate depression: 9 months after receiving the intervention, depressive symptoms were significantly lower, there was a positive effect on patients’ quality of life, and patients experienced less anxiety, possessed more selfefficacy skills, demonstrated better glycaemic control and showed more participation in comparison to control patients.' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;The starting point was a nurse-led minimal psychological intervention. A previous randomised trial has shown that this intervention was cost-effective for patients with diabetes with minor to moderate depression: 9 months after receiving the intervention, depressive symptoms were significantly lower, there was a positive effect on patients' quality of life, and patients experienced less anxiety, possessed more self-efficacy and demonstrated better glycaemic control and showed more participation in comparison to control patients.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: The intervention involved practice nurses delivering a psychological intervention after receiving training. This goes beyond the resources and expertise typically available in usual care. However, the intervention was still delivered by practice nurses in their existing setting, not requiring additional staff or facilities. This suggests an intermediate level of pragmatism.

The randomisation was performed by an independent research assistant who used a random number seed computer program to assign PNs to either condition.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: Practice nurses had some flexibility in working solo vs in teams and in different settings. However, they were instructed in how to deliver the intervention. The text does not describe any tailoring or flexibility in the actual delivery. Overall this suggests an explanatory approach, but there is limited information provided.
Score: [2]

Flexibility (adherence):
Quotes: No relevant quotes identified. The intervention was delivered by practice nurses to patients, but there is no information on if or how patient adherence was monitored or enforced.
Score: [NA]

Follow-up:
Quotes: <span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 96.4%):

The glycated haemoglobin in mmol/mol was measured during consultations. For the baseline measure, we used data from the first consultation after the patient’s baseline measurement (with a maximum interval of 3 months). The consultation following this first consultation was used as the 4-month follow-up measurement. The last measurement was the assessment approximately 1 year after the patient’s baseline measurement (at least more than 6 months after the first consultation).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;The glycaemic control of patients was measured during consultations. For the baseline measure, we used data from the first consultation after the patient's baseline measurement (within a maximum interval of 3 months). The consultation following this first consultation was used as the 4-month follow-up measurement. The last measurement was the assessment approximately 1 year after the patient's baseline measurement (at least more than 6 months after the first consultation).&quot;</span>
Reasoning: Follow-up assessments occurred during routine consultations at approximately 4 months and 1 year. This seems to align with the typical follow-up schedule for patients with diabetes in usual care. No extra follow-up visits were required. This is a pragmatic approach.
Score: [4]

Primary outcome:
Quotes: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The effect of SMS on patients' daily functioning was measured by means of the DFT. The DFT was dichotomised to compare the number of patients who were improved in their daily functioning and had apparently found a satisfactory way to live with the consequences of their diabetes (DFT ≤4) with patients who still perceived a burden of diabetes on their daily functioning (DFT >4).&quot;</span>
Reasoning: The primary outcome was a patient-reported measure of daily functioning, which is directly relevant to patients. The DFT questionnaire is not described in detail, so it is unclear if it is commonly used in usual care. Dichotomizing scores is also less pragmatic than using the full scale. Overall, the primary outcome is somewhat pragmatic but with some limitations.

Reasoning: The analysis included all available data from 90% of participants who completed all or most follow-up measurements. This is a fairly pragmatic approach, although it falls a bit short of a full intention-to-treat analysis including all randomized participants.

Eligible primary care patients 12 to 80 years of age had impaired asthmarelated quality of life (Mini Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire [MiniAQLQ] score ≤6) or inadequate asthma control (Asthma Control Questionnaire [ACQ] score ≥1).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;Eligible primary care patients 12 to 80 years of age had impaired asthma-related quality of life (Mini Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire [MiniAQLQ] score ≤6) or inadequate asthma control (Asthma Control Questionnaire [ACQ] score ≥1).&quot;</span>
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Other eligibility criteria for both trials included, at screening, a peak expiratory flow (PEF) greater than 50% of the predicted value after an inhaled beta2-agonist had been withheld for 4 hours or longer and, at the baseline visit, evidence of impaired asthma-related quality of life (a score ≤6 on the Mini Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire25,26 [MiniAQLQ]) or impaired asthma control (a score ≥1 on the Asthma Control Questionnaire27 [ACQ]).&quot;</span>

The eligibility criteria included patients with impaired asthma-related quality of life or inadequate asthma control based on validated questionnaires. While these criteria would identify patients likely to be treated in usual care, the specific thresholds used on the questionnaires are more stringent than what would typically be used in routine practice. The PEF criterion is also more specific than usual care. However, the age range of 12-80 years is quite broad and representative of asthma patients seen in primary care practice.

The trials were conducted at multiple centers and used an automated telephone system to randomly assign patients, which is different from the usual recruitment methods in routine care. However, the patients were all recruited from primary care practices, which is representative of real-world settings. No additional details are provided on extra recruitment efforts that would not be seen in usual care.

Double-blind treatment, although ideal for internal validity, would have severely affected the external validity (applicability) of this study.

First, not revealing treatment assignments to the patients and health care providers would have hampered our goal of assessing the effect of differential adherence to oral versus inhaled therapy under conditions of usual patient and physician behaviors and preferences.&quot;</span>

The treatments were open-label, allowing health care providers to deliver care with the flexibility seen in usual practice. Differential adherence between oral and inhaled treatments was allowed to occur naturally. This suggests care delivery had a pragmatic approach.

Adherence was not enforced, and differential adherence between treatment groups was allowed to occur naturally, as would happen in real-world practice. Poor adherence was common but was considered representative of usual care by the authors. No measures to improve adherence are mentioned.

Follow-up:
Quotes:
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Patients who met the eligibility criteria completed a validated asthma-symptom diary28 for 2 weeks before the baseline visit for an assessment of PEF variability and to record current symptoms. After the screening visit (week −2) and baseline visit (week 0), study assessments by telephone or in the clinic were scheduled at months 2, 6, 12, 18, and 24.&quot;</span>

The follow-up schedule involved both remote telephone assessments and in-person clinic visits over 2 years. This is more frequent and extensive than typical follow-up for asthma patients in usual care over this time period. However, the use of telephone visits provides some pragmatic approach compared to only in-person assessments.

The primary outcome measure was the MiniAQLQ score. 25,26 Secondary outcome measures included the ACQ score 27 ; the score on the not-yet-validated Royal College of Physicians 3-item asthma questionnaire (RCP3) (range of scores, 0 to 3, with higher scores indicating worse asthma control) 30 ; the score on the validated 14-item Mini Rhinoconjunctivitis Quality of Life Questionnaire (MiniRQLQ) (range of scores, 0 to 6, with higher scores indicating worse rhinitis-related impairment and with an MID of 0.7) 31 ; and the frequency of asthma exacerbations, which were defined as the need for an oral course of glucocorticoids or hospitalization for asthma.' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;The primary outcome measure was the MiniAQLQ score.25,26 Secondary outcome measures included the ACQ score27; the score on the not-yet-validated Royal College of Physicians 3-item asthma questionnaire (RCP3) (range of scores, 0 to 3, with higher scores indicating worse asthma control)30; the score on the validated 14-item Mini Rhino-conjunctivitis Quality of Life Questionnaire (MiniRQLQ) (range of scores, 0 to 6, with higher scores indicating worse rhinitis-related impairment and with an MID of 0.7)31; and the frequency of asthma exacerbations, which were defined as the need for an oral course of glucocorticoids or hospitalization for asthma.&quot;</span>

The primary outcome was the MiniAQLQ, a validated questionnaire assessing asthma-related quality of life. This is a patient-centered outcome that would be relevant to participants. Secondary outcomes included asthma control, rhinitis-related quality of life, and exacerbation frequency, which are also important to patients. The outcome measures are questionnaires that could be used in usual care, not requiring specialized assessment.

The primary analysis was intention-to-treat at the 2-month and 2-year timepoints. This pragmatic approach included all randomized participants. Equivalence testing was used, with a conservative margin pre-specified that was lower than the minimum important difference to account for uncertainty in real-world variability. Some secondary analyses used a per-protocol approach, which is less pragmatic, but the main analysis was intention-to-treat.

The eligibility criteria were quite broad, with patients advised to exercise regularly as usual care in the control group. The intervention group also received usual care with some additional assessments. This suggests the trial included a broad patient population similar to those who would receive the intervention as part of usual care.
Score: [4]

Recruitment:

Patients followed a home exercise program similar to what they did in the hospital, but had flexibility to complete it on their own schedule using a mobile device. Some monitoring of adherence to the schedule was done.
Score: [4]

Flexibility (adherence):
Quotes: <span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 99.5%):

patient in the IG arm was classified as a non-complier if he/she did not perform scheduled exercises for at least 8 consecutive weeks, unless there were clear clinical reasons not to.' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;A patient in the IG arm was classified as a non-complier if he/she did not perform scheduled exercises for at least 8 consecutive weeks, unless there were clear clinical reasons not to.&quot;</span>
Adherence was monitored and patients were considered non-compliant if they missed 8 consecutive weeks of exercise without clinical justification. However, there was no mention of excluding non-adherent patients. Adherence monitoring may be somewhat beyond what is done in usual care.
Score: [3]

Follow-up:
Quotes: <span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 95.7%):

Primary analysis:
Quotes: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Continuous variables are described using either the mean and standard deviation or the median and range, depending on the data distribution. Categorical variables are described using frequencies and percentages. The main efficacy analysis used analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) techniques to test for differences between groups in outcome variables at the 12-month visit, adjusted for baseline values.&quot;</span>
The primary analysis used ANCOVA adjusting for baseline values, which is consistent with an intent-to-treat approach. Missing data was imputed using a mixed model approach.

Eligibility:
Quotes: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Eighty people with Expanded Disability Status scores of 1 to 6.5 participated in this trial.&quot;</span>
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;At enrollment, all participants underwent a clinical examination by a neurologist (F.O.) to assess their EDSS scores and review their medical history, noting the type of MS, age, sex, weight, height, and medications.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: The trial included participants with EDSS scores of 1 to 6.5, which represents a fairly broad range of disability levels. However, all participants underwent a clinical examination by a neurologist to assess EDSS scores and medical history, which is more extensive than what would typically occur in usual care.
Score: [3]

Recruitment:
Quotes: <span title='Moderate quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 89.6%):

In August 2015, 1 of the MS nurses at the Department of Neurology, Nordland Hospital Trust in Bodø, Norway, sent out invitation letters with a consent form to 160 persons with MS who were registered at the MS outpatient clinic,' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ff9e81'>&quot;In August 2015, 1 of the 6 municipalities included in the study sent out invitation letters with a consent form to 160 persons with MS who were registered at the MS outpatient clinic.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: Recruitment was done by sending invitation letters to potential participants registered at the MS outpatient clinic. This is a more targeted approach than what would occur in usual care, where recruitment would likely occur through usual clinic visits without extra effort.
Score: [2]

Setting:
Quotes: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The GroupCoreDIST intervention was conducted by 6 physical therapists in 6 municipalities in Norway.

The training included practical and theoretical training.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: The intervention required specialized training of the physical therapists over 5 days, which differs from the resources and organization of usual care. However, the therapists were already neurological physical therapists, so some relevant expertise was present.
Score: [3]

Flexibility (delivery):
Quotes: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The physical therapists had varied experience in neurological physical therapy and were clinical specialists in neurological physical therapy, 1 was a clinical specialist in neurological physical therapy, and 3 were generalists in physical therapy.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: The physical therapists delivering the intervention had varied levels of experience and specialization, allowing some flexibility. However, they all underwent the same 5-day training, suggesting a degree of standardization beyond usual care.
Score: [3]

Flexibility (adherence):
Quotes: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants allocated to the intervention group were divided into 13 training groups by B.N. and E.C.A. according to geography. The physical therapists conducted an individual clinical examination of each participant.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: Participants were allocated to training groups based on geography and underwent individual examinations, allowing tailoring to individual needs. However, the intervention itself followed a set program with a specified dose.
Score: [3]

Follow-up:
Quotes: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Assessments were undertaken at baseline and at weeks 7, 18, and 30. Outcomes were measured with the Trunk Impairment Scale–Norwegian Version, Mini Balance Evaluation Systems Test, and Patient Global Impression of Change–Balance.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: Follow-up assessments occurred at baseline and 3 timepoints after the intervention, which is more extensive than typical follow-up in usual care. The assessments used a mix of standard and study-specific measures.
Score: [2]

n balance and trunk control in individuals with MS.' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: red'>&quot;The primary outcome was balance and trunk control in individuals with MS.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: Balance and trunk control is an outcome that is likely to be important to individuals with MS. The measures used (TIS-NV and Mini-BESTest) appear to have clinical relevance.
Score: [4]

Primary analysis:
Quotes: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;One individual missed all postintervention tests, leaving 79 participants in the intention-to-treat analysis.&quot;</span>

We administered the screening questionnaires via telephone. Inclusion criteria were the presence of PPMS or SPMS, Internet access and some level of distress determined by a score of 3 or greater on the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12).17&quot;</span>
Recruitment was done via telephone screening questionnaires to identify people with MS who had some distress. This method goes a bit beyond how recruitment would typically occur in usual care, but is not a highly targeted approach. The trial is somewhat pragmatic in terms of recruitment.
Score: [3]

Setting:
Quotes: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;We recruited potential participants through adverts on the MS Society website and from National Health Service (NHS) MS centres across the UK.&quot;</span>
The trial recruited from a mix of MS Society websites and multiple NHS MS centers across the UK. This appears to be a fairly typical mix of settings from which MS patients would be drawn in usual care. The trial is quite pragmatic in terms of setting.
Score: [4]

Organization:
Quotes: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The treatment phase took place between February 2013 and July 2013.

The intervention required videoconference sessions over Skype in groups over an 8 week period. This organization is quite different from what would be available in usual care, requiring additional technical setup and scheduling. The trial is quite explanatory in terms of organization.
Score: [2]

Flexibility (delivery):

The content of the manual was adapted from the Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) course book.22&quot;</span>
The intervention followed a set manual adapted from MBCT including specific session lengths and practices. This suggests a fairly inflexible, standardized delivery compared to usual care. The trial is quite explanatory in terms of flexibility of delivery.
Score: [2]

Flexibility (adherence):
Quotes: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Eighteen of the 19 participants completed the mindfulness intervention. One participant dropped out after the first session due to changes in personal circumstances but continued to complete the study questionnaires.&quot;</span>
Adherence to the intervention was very high, with 18/19 participants completing it. However, the one participant who dropped out early still completed study questionnaires. There is not enough information to determine if any measures were taken to improve or enforce adherence.

All the participants attended four or more of the eight mindfulness sessions and 14 (73.7%) attended six or more sessions.&quot;</span>
Follow-up occurred immediately post-intervention and at 3 months, with questionnaires on several outcomes. 14/19 participants attended 6 or more sessions. This follow-up is more intense than would typically occur in usual care over this timeframe. The trial is quite explanatory in terms of follow-up.

Primary analysis:

The overall sample was 55% female, predominantly white British (90%), with a mean age of 52.7 years (SD = 9.5), with the majority married or cohabiting (77.5%).&quot;</span>
The primary analysis appears to have included all randomized participants. No mention is made of excluding any participants from the analysis. This suggests an intent-to-treat approach was used, which is pragmatic.

Eligibility:
Quotes: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The inclusion criteria were as follows: age > 18, confirmed diagnosis of MS, Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS): 2.0–6.5, Six Spot Step Test (SSST) score > 8 seconds or Timed 25-Foot Walk (T25FW) > 5 seconds, relapse-free within the past 8 weeks, and no adjustment of disease-modifying medication or medication that affects gait performance and spasticity within the past 8 weeks.&quot;</span>
The trial had fairly strict inclusion criteria, including specific age range, disability level, gait impairment measures, and requirements for disease stability and medication use. While not as narrow as some highly explanatory trials, these criteria are more restrictive than what would typically be used in routine care for this patient population.
Score: [3]

Recruitment:
Quotes: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants were included from September 2016 to October 2018, after being invited via seven MS clinics (specified in &quot;</span>Acknowledgements<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot; section) and targeted advertisements sent out via the Danish MS Society.&quot;</span>
Recruitment was done through a combination of inviting patients from multiple MS clinics and targeted advertisements via the national MS society. This approach, while not as selective as some explanatory trials, is more involved than the usual recruitment that would occur in routine care.

Allocation of interventions was done by a cluster randomization conducted whenever a sufficient number of patients were established at three different participating clinics.&quot;</span>
The trial was conducted at multiple physiotherapy clinics, which is more representative of real-world settings than a single center. However, the cluster randomization by clinic and referral of groups of patients differs from routine care.
Score: [4] 

Organization:
Quotes: <span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 96.8%):

The therapists were instructed to aim for a level of difficulty, where the participants experienced failure but still reached successful execution in more than 50% of the attempts/time.' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;The therapists were instructed to aim for a level of difficulty, where the participants experienced failure but still completed successful execution in more than 50% of the attempts/time.&quot;</span>
The interventions required specialized training of the physical therapists and aimed for a specific level of intensity/difficulty. This represents a greater level of expertise and resources than would typically be available in routine care.
Score: [2]

Flexibility (delivery):
Quotes: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The exercises were conducted in machines that targeted the specified muscle groups, but type of machines could vary between centers. All training sessions were supervised by physiotherapists who were trained to deliver the intervention.&quot;</span>
While there was some flexibility in the specific exercise machines used, the interventions followed a defined protocol in terms of muscles targeted, supervision, and progression. All sessions were supervised by specially trained physiotherapists. This is less flexible than the delivery of these interventions would likely be in routine care.
Score: [2]

Flexibility (adherence):
The trial did not report any information on measures to improve or monitor patient adherence to the interventions. There is not enough information to assess flexibility of adherence.
Score: [NA]

Follow-up:
Quotes: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The follow-up test was performed within 7 days of the last intervention session or after the last day of being on the waitlist.&quot;</span>
A single follow-up assessment was performed within 7 days of completing the intervention. This is only a short-term follow-up, with a more rigid window than would be typical in routine care. However, the overall follow-up intensity is not greatly increased compared to routine.
Score: [3]

Primary outcome:
Quotes: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The primary outcomes were walking speed assessed by the T25FW20 and complex walking assessed by the SSST.21 Both outcomes were obtained at the fastest safe walking speed and conducted in accordance with the original descriptions.&quot;</span>
The primary outcomes of walking speed and complex walking ability are highly relevant to patients with MS. The measures used (T25FW and SSST) are well-established and do not require any specialized equipment or expertise beyond what could be available in routine care.
Score: [5]

Primary analysis:
Quotes: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Analyses were carried out as intention-to-treat, where all participants were included regardless of their adherence to the allocated intervention. Carry forward imputations were not used to replace missing data in the primary intention to treat analysis.&quot;</span>
The primary analysis was conducted as intention-to-treat, including all randomized participants regardless of adherence. No methods were used to impute missing data. This matches the typically pragmatic approach of including all available data with minimal imputation.

The trial had fairly broad eligibility criteria, inviting a large number of people with MS to be screened. However, there were several exclusion criteria that differ from usual care, such as cognitive function cutoffs, BDI score cutoffs, and restrictions on comorbid psychiatric disorders. The eligibility criteria were somewhat more stringent than would be typical in usual care.

Quotes: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;We invited 582 people diagnosed with MS to screen for a study evaluating an intervention for low mood by completing a screening questionnaire including prognostic and eligibility criteria and a copy of the Beck Depression Inventory II-21 item (BDI) [18].&quot;</span>
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Postal screening via the Walton Centre resulted in 10 participants in 5 months, face to face recruitment at STH resulted in 14 participants in 9 months. From this evidence a full trial of 180 participants would require at least 13 sites, particularly considering that recruitment may be slower in a full-scale trial, where a team is reliant on other centres.&quot;</span>

Recruitment was done via postal screening and face-to-face recruitment at specific MS centers. This differs somewhat from usual care, where patients would likely be approached during routine visits. The authors note that recruitment was slow and would require many sites for a full trial, suggesting recruitment involved more effort than would be typical in usual care.

We also highlighted the University's involvement in the study.&quot;</span>

The primary outcome was recruitment rate, based on completion of a screening questionnaire, which is not a directly patient-relevant outcome. The authors used some strategies to optimize response rates to questionnaires. Overall, the primary outcome is not one that would be available or relevant to decision-making in usual care.

Of these six patients, the median time (IQR) to complete all eight CCBT sessions was 15 (13 to 20) weeks against an intended eight weeks time frame.&quot;</span>

The primary analysis was intention-to-treat, including all randomized participants. Only 50% of participants in the CCBT arm completed all 8 intended sessions, but 75% completed at least 4 sessions, which the authors considered a reasonably high compliance rate. The analysis appears to be largely pragmatic, including all available data, though the completion rates of the intervention were suboptimal compared to the intended protocol.

Eligibility:
Quotes: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Patients who perceive their medication to be ineffective or inconvenient are less likely to be adherent to treatment, with potentially significant consequences on long-term clinical outcomes. Many patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) are nonadherent to treatment despite demonstrated efficacy of disease-modifying therapies (DMTs).&quot;</span>
Reasoning: The trial included patients who perceived their medication to be ineffective or inconvenient, which is likely similar to the real-world population of MS patients. However, it's not clear if there were any other exclusion criteria that may have made the trial population differ from those who would receive the intervention as part of usual care.
Score: [4]

Recruitment:
Quotes: None relevant to recruitment methods.
Reasoning: The full text does not provide any details on the recruitment methods used in this trial or how they compare to usual care recruitment. There is insufficient information to assess how pragmatic or explanatory the recruitment was.
Score: [NA] 

Setting:
Quotes: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;This study was conducted in full accordance with the International Council for Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH) Good Clinical Practice Consolidated Guideline (E6) and any applicable national and local laws and regulations.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: Conducting the trial in accordance with ICH Good Clinical Practice guidelines suggests the setting may have been more regulated and less reflective of usual care. However, no details are provided on the specific trial settings. There is insufficient information to fully assess how the trial setting compares to usual care.

In this phase 4, open-label, interventional study, we used the Medication Satisfaction Questionnaire (MSQ) (Canuso et al., 2010) to compare patient-reported medication satisfaction, and Multiple Sclerosis Treatment Adherence Questionnaire (MS-TAQ) (Wicks et al., 2011) to assess the adherence of patients with RRMS on GA40 versus those on GA20.' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;In this phase 4, open-label, interventional study, we used the Medication Satisfaction Questionnaire (MSQ) (Caruso et al., 2010) to compare patient-reported medication satisfaction, and Multiple Sclerosis Treatment Adherence Questionnaire (MS-TAQ) (Wicks et al., 2011) to assess the adherence of patients with RRMS on GA40 versus those on GA20.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: Use of questionnaires like the MSQ and MS-TAQ to assess medication satisfaction and adherence suggests a less flexible, more explanatory approach than usual care. The trial seems to have a set protocol for administering these questionnaires.
Score: [2]

Flexibility (adherence):
Quotes: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Patients' adherence to treatment measured at Months 1, 3, and 6 using the MS-TAQ questionnaire showed consistently greater adherence to treatment in patients receiving GA40 compared with those receiving GA20&quot;</span>
Reasoning: Patients' adherence to treatment was measured using a questionnaire at set timepoints, indicating a less flexible, more explanatory approach than usual care. However, no details are provided on if measures were taken to exclude patients based on adherence or improve their adherence.
Score: [2] 

Follow-up:
Quotes: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Safety assessments were recorded in clinic visits and included adverse events (AEs) throughout the study, vital sign measurements, concomitant medication usage, and clinical laboratory test results at screening and Months 1, 3, and 6. Safety variables monitored also included the percentage of early treatment discontinuation patients who prematurely discontinued from the study due to AEs, as well as the time to withdrawal.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: Safety assessments were conducted at multiple in-clinic visits with measurement of various outcomes like adverse events, vital signs, medications, and labs. This represents a more explanatory approach with more frequent and extensive follow-up than would be expected in usual care.

Reasoning: The primary outcome of patient-reported medication satisfaction using the MSQ questionnaire is likely relevant and important to patients. However, use of this questionnaire may not be typical in usual care across all the geographic regions in the trial. The outcome assessment has some explanatory elements but is still reasonably pragmatic.

The trial recruited participants through an MS organization and clinic, and had some exclusion criteria related to age, MS diagnosis, ambulation score, and medical clearance. While these criteria likely selected participants who are representative of the target population with relapsing-remitting MS and mild to moderate disability, the medical clearance requirement makes the eligibility slightly more restrictive than what would be typical in usual care.

The training intensity was based on the recommendations of the American College of Sports Medicine (2009)7 and consisted of two sets of 10–12 repetitions of each exercise, at a training intensity of 10–12 repetition maximum (that is, only 12 consecutive repetitions of each exercise could be completed before muscle fatigue was reached).&quot;</span>

The intervention followed a defined protocol in terms of frequency, intensity, and mode of strength training exercises. However, it allowed some flexibility by using different community gyms and basing the intensity on individualized repetition maximum rather than a strict percentage. The delivery appears to be somewhat less flexible than a typical gym program but more flexible than a rigid experimental protocol.

Flexibility (adherence):
Quotes: None relevant.

The paper does not appear to discuss any strategies to monitor or enforce participant adherence to the intervention. There is not enough information provided to assess flexibility of adherence.

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;After completing their 10-week intervention programs, participants were asked to return to their usual activities and not to continue or commence resistance training until after the follow-up assessment session.&quot;</span>

Outcome assessments were done at baseline, 10 weeks, and 22 weeks. Participants were asked to return to usual activities after the 10-week program ended. This follow-up is more extensive and structured than what would typically occur in a regular gym program, but less intensive than many explanatory trials.

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Changes in muscle strength were determined by the amount of weight that could be lifted in a single seated leg press (1RM, 1 repetition maximum) and a single reverse leg press (resistance of the combined movement of hip flexion, knee flexion and ankle dorsiflexion) (1RM). In adults with MS, a single 1RM leg press has been measured with high levels of retest reliability (r > 0.93).&quot;</span>

The primary outcomes were walking endurance and muscle strength, which are directly relevant to participants' functioning. The measures used (2-minute walk test and 1 repetition maximum strength tests) are objective and appear to have good reliability in people with MS. They likely have more relevance to participants than many surrogate measures.

The study used an intention-to-treat analysis, including all participants who started the intervention. However, the sample size calculation was based on an effect size from a pilot study, rather than targeting a clinically meaningful difference. Overall, the analysis seems to be fairly pragmatic but not maximally so.

Exclusion criteria were reports' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: red'>&quot;Exclusion criteria were reports of cardiovascular contra-indications, logistic problem or Automated segmentation of MRI.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: The eligibility criteria are somewhat stricter than what would be used in usual care, with ability to walk 5km unassisted required. However, the criteria are not overly strict, with recruitment from typical sources for MS patients. Some exclusion criteria like cardiovascular contraindications and logistical problems would likely also be applied in usual care.

Reasoning: Recruitment was done through typical channels where MS patients would be found, such as MS societies, rehabilitation centers, and sport programs. This is similar to how recruitment would likely occur in usual care. No additional efforts like targeted invitations or incentives are mentioned.
Score: [5]

Setting:
Quotes: No relevant quotes found. The setting of the intervention is not clearly described.

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The running intervention was successful to increase aerobic capacity. The 6% change in VO2max exceeded biological variability, while the 13% change in workload (in W) was in between the range of 6%–25% found during supervised bicycle training in pwMS with comparable or higher disability.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: The intervention involved supervised training, which may require more resources and expertise than typically available in usual care. However, the change in aerobic capacity and workload are noted to be similar to those found in previous supervised training in pwMS, suggesting the resources needed were not substantially greater than what has been done before in this population.

Reasoning: The participants were self-selected from a specific multiple sclerosis clinic population. While this represents the typical population that would receive the intervention, the self-selection aspect makes the eligibility criteria slightly more explanatory than a fully pragmatic approach.
Score: [4]

The research project was explained, and written informed consent was obtained.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: Participants were recruited through interviews at the clinic they were already attending. This is a relatively pragmatic approach, using a setting and procedure similar to usual care. However, the separate interviews and consent process is more effort than would be typical for usual care recruitment.

Flexibility (delivery):
Quotes: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The decision as to the length of the treatment series was pragmatic and related to the length of the students' specialty clinic rotations, which are scheduled over an eight week period.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: Treatment length was determined pragmatically based on the student clinicians' schedules, suggesting flexibility in delivery. However, a strict eight week period is still more structured than fully pragmatic usual care.
Score: [4]

Flexibility (adherence):
Quotes: No relevant quotes identified. The intervention studied was massage therapy delivered by therapists, so participant adherence is not applicable.

Reasoning: The standing frame intervention did not require additional resources, expertise or organization compared to usual care. The assessments were done by masked assessors which is an enhancement over usual care, but overall the organization closely mirrored a typical clinical setting.

At the end of the 20-week period, participants were encouraged to continue to regularly stand, although no further physiotherapy support was provided.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: Participants were given a recommended standing protocol of 30 minutes 3 times per week over 20 weeks, but had flexibility in how they implemented this. They were asked to document their standing in a diary, representing some additional monitoring. After the 20 week period, no further support was provided but participants were encouraged to continue standing regularly. Overall this represents a largely pragmatic approach with some minor enhancements over usual care flexibility.

Reasoning: Participants were asked to record their standing frequency and duration in a daily diary. This allowed monitoring of adherence, but no further measures to enhance or enforce adherence were mentioned. Participants were encouraged to continue standing after the initial 20 week period but this was not enforced. This represents a largely pragmatic approach that is similar to how adherence would be handled in usual care.

Follow-up:
Quotes: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Assessments were done independently and away from the participant's home.

Reasoning: Follow-up assessments were conducted at 20 and 36 weeks, which exceeds what would typically be done in usual care. The assessments were done independently away from the participant's home by masked assessors, which also represents an enhancement over usual care follow-up procedures. However, the follow-up intervals of 20 and 36 weeks are not dramatically different from typical care.

The primary clinical outcome was motor function measured by the Amended Motor Club Assessment (AMCA) score at week 36, analysed in the modified intention-to-treat population (excluding only patients who were deemed ineligible after randomisation, those who withdrew from the trial and were unwilling for their previously collected data to be used, or those who did not provide baseline and week 36 measurements).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;The primary clinical outcome was motor function as measured by the Amended Motor Club Assessment (AMCA) score at week 36, analysed in the modified intention-to-treat population (excluding only patients who were deemed ineligible after randomisation, those who did not provide baseline and week 36 measurements).&quot;</span>
Reasoning: The primary outcome was a clinician-rated measure of motor function (AMCA score) at 36 weeks. Motor function is an outcome that is meaningful to patients. The AMCA score requires some clinician expertise to administer that exceeds what is typically available in usual care, but does not represent an overly specialized or esoteric measure. The 36 week time point is longer than typical but still a reasonable time frame from a patient perspective.

Reasoning: The primary analysis used a modified intention-to-treat approach, including all participants who provided baseline and 36 week outcomes data. This excludes participants who were deemed ineligible after randomization or missing both baseline and follow-up measurements. While not a pure intention-to-treat analysis, this still represents a largely pragmatic approach that includes most participants.

Eligibility:
Quotes: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Eligible participants were over 18 years of age and had a diagnosis of MS that was confirmed by a consultant physician or neurologist. Persons with MS were excluded if they had a previous relapse or began steroid therapy in the 12 weeks prior to participating in the first assessment, were pregnant, or had a comorbidity that severely impacted their ability to safely participate in exercise.&quot;</span>
The eligibility criteria are somewhat stricter than what would be used in usual care, excluding those with recent relapses, steroid therapy, pregnancy or severe comorbidities that impact exercise participation. However, the population is still fairly broad, including anyone over 18 with confirmed MS.

The CG was asked not to change their exercise habit for the 10-week period between assessments.&quot;</span>
The organization of the intervention, using existing community centers and group classes led by physiotherapists and fitness/yoga instructors, is very similar to what would be available in usual care. The control group was simply asked to continue their usual habits. No additional resources or expertise beyond usual care were required.

Flexibility (delivery):
Quotes: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The PT-led exercise provided was pre-defined. It consisted of a circuit-style class of exercises that were either resisted by body weight or by the addition of free weights. The exercises were to sit to stand/squat, bridging, resisted shoulder flexion, walking/cycling, resisted elbow flexion, lunges or resisted knee extension, hip extension and calf raises; working to an intensity whereby the aim was to be failing on the 12th repetition of the exercise, with the load increased by 2–5%, when 12 repetitions were achieved with ease.&quot;</span>
The PT-led intervention had a pre-defined circuit of specific exercises, with progressions based on number of repetitions achieved. This suggests a fairly strict, explanatory protocol for delivery. However, some flexibility remained as the load was increased based on individual performance.
Score: [2]

Flexibility (adherence):
Quotes: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The yoga intervention was also not predefined, and detailed descriptions of the classes were gathered by nine of the instructors. Seven out of the nine instructors who returned details on the intervention commenced the class with breathing exercises, relaxation or 'body centering.'&quot;</span>
Participant adherence flexibility is not explicitly addressed in the text. The yoga intervention not being pre-defined and varying somewhat between instructors suggests there was likely flexibility in adherence similar to usual care yoga classes. However, there is insufficient information to fully judge adherence flexibility.

Follow-up:
Quotes: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Outcome was assessed at week 24 for the intervention groups only, as it was felt that withholding a potentially beneficial treatment for longer than 12 weeks, from the controls, could be considered unethical. As all groups were not treated similarly between weeks 12 and 24, and due to the high attrition rates at weeks 12 and 24, the results of our follow-up phase will be presented in a separate paper.&quot;</span>
The 10-week intervention period with assessment at weeks 1, 12 and 24 is more frequent and longer than typical follow-up for a community exercise program. Controls were only ethically able to be untreated for 12 weeks. This follow-up is more intensive than usual care.

The primary analysis used repeated measures ANOVA on the physical subscale of the MSIS-29. This appears to be an intent-to-treat analysis using all participant data, which is a pragmatic approach. However, the distribution of data was first checked and non-parametric tests were considered, which is more explanatory. On balance, the primary analysis leans pragmatic.

The trial compared alemtuzumab to an active control (interferon-β-1a) in patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis who had an inadequate response to prior therapy. While some exclusion criteria were applied, the patient population appears to be fairly representative of the types of MS patients who would receive alemtuzumab in usual care. The trial was not overly selective.

Only patients with baseline EDSS ≥2.0 were included in the analysis of CDI; 154 (alemtuzumab, n = 105; subcutaneous interferon-β-1a [SC IFN-β-1a], n = 49) patients were excluded from the analysis for not meeting this criterion.&quot;</span>
The primary analysis used Kaplan-Meier estimates of the risk of achieving 6-month confirmed disability improvement (CDI). Patients with baseline EDSS <2.0 were excluded. While not a fully intention-to-treat approach, the analysis included most randomized patients and estimated a pragmatic outcome. Some exclusions were made for patients with lower baseline disability.

<pre>
Eligibility:
Quotes: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;We examined effects of a mindfulness-based intervention (MBI) compared to usual care (UC) upon HRQOL, depression, and fatigue among adults with relapsing-remitting or secondary progressive MS.&quot;</span>
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;A total of 150 patients were randomly assigned to the intervention (n = 76) or to UC (n = 74).&quot;</span>
Reasoning: The study included patients with relapsing-remitting or secondary progressive MS, which represents a fairly broad and representative sample of MS patients. However, some exclusion criteria were applied, such as excluding those refusing to participate or with other reasons. Overall, the eligibility criteria seem moderately pragmatic, but not as broad as what would be seen in usual care.
Score: [3]

Recruitment:
Quotes: No specific quotes related to recruitment methods.
Reasoning: The full text does not provide details on the recruitment methods used in this trial, such as whether recruitment was done through usual clinic visits or if more explanatory methods like targeted invitations were used. There is not enough information to assess how pragmatic or explanatory the recruitment was.
Score: [NA] 

Setting:
Quotes: No specific quotes describing the trial setting.
Reasoning: The full text does not describe the setting in which this trial was conducted, such as whether it used typical community clinics or specialized academic centers. Without this information, the pragmatism of the setting cannot be evaluated.
Score: [NA]

Organization:
Quotes: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;MBI consisted of a structured 8-week program of mindfulness training.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: The intervention involved an 8-week structured mindfulness training program, which likely required additional training and resources beyond what is typically available in usual care. This suggests a more explanatory approach in terms of organization. However, without more details on the training and resources required compared to usual care, a precise assessment is difficult.
Score: [2] 

Flexibility (delivery):
Quotes: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;MBI closely followed the program of mindfulness-based stress reduction and included 1) a personal intake interview to define realistic goals of participants and establish personal rapport; 2) 8 weekly 2.5-hour classes in mindfulness practices (10–15 participants/group; exercise did not exceed patients' level of functioning); 3) one Saturday, 7-hour session at week 6; 4) homework assignments (approximately 40 minutes/day); emphasized as essential to success of the program; 5) a postintervention interview to evaluate personal experiences, goal attainment, and future maintenance of acquired skills.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: The MBI intervention followed a structured program with multiple sessions, a full-day retreat, and homework assignments. This suggests a fairly inflexible, explanatory approach to intervention delivery compared to usual care. However, some pragmatic elements were present, like the personal interviews to establish rapport and personalized goals.
Score: [2]

Flexibility (adherence):
Quotes: No specific quotes related to flexibility in participant adherence.
Reasoning: The article does not provide clear information on how strictly participant adherence was monitored or enforced (e.g. if there were exclusions based on adherence). The personal intake interviews to establish goals suggest some pragmatism, but overall there is insufficient information to fully judge flexibility in adherence.
Score: [NA]

Follow-up:
Quotes: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Assessments were made at baseline, postintervention, and 6 months follow-up.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: Participants were followed up immediately post-intervention and at 6 months. This schedule does not seem overly burdensome compared to usual care, but is likely somewhat more intensive than typical follow-up for an educational intervention. The 6-month follow-up in particular adds a layer of follow-up that may exceed usual care.
Score: [3]

Primary outcome:
Quotes: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Primary outcomes included disease-specific and disease-aspecific HRQOL, depression, and fatigue.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: The primary outcomes of quality of life, depression and fatigue are likely to be meaningful and important to patients. These outcomes don't seem to require specialized assessment not available in usual care. This suggests a fairly pragmatic approach to primary outcome selection.
Score: [4]

Primary analysis:
Quotes: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Employing intention-to-treat analysis, MBI, compared with UC, improved nonphysical dimensions of primary outcomes at postintervention and follow-up (p < 0.002); effect sizes, 0.4–0.9 posttreatment and 0.3–0.5 at follow-up.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: The use of an intention-to-treat analysis preserves the pragmatic design and avoids explanatory exclusions from the analysis. No mention is made of excluding participants from the primary analysis.

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The hypothesis is that the H-CAD system is at least as effective as the usual care for arm/hand function, measured with outcome measures for arm/hand function, given to the stroke, TBI and MS patients when they are living at home.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: The trial included a broad range of patients with stroke, TBI, and MS, which is fairly representative of the target population for this intervention. However, the inclusion of only patients living at home and able to do the training suggests some selection criteria that differ from usual care.
Score: [4]

Recruitment:
Quotes: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Patients were recruited from Unità Organica di Riabilitazione Intensiva Neuromotoria (UORIN, Italy), Foundation Institute Guttmann (FPING, Spain) and from National Multiple Sclerosis Centre (NMSC, Belgium).&quot;</span>
Reasoning: Patients were recruited from specialized rehabilitation centers in multiple countries. While this is likely more effort than recruitment in usual care, the centers themselves treat the target population. The full text does not provide enough details to determine how much extra effort was made to recruit participants.

Reasoning: The trial provided the H-CAD system and specialized desks to patients' homes, which differs from the resources available in usual care. However, the actual organization of care delivery was kept similar, with patients continuing to receive some usual care. The training frequency and duration was specified but allowed some flexibility.

Inclusion criteria were patients in South East London, living with MS and deemed by clinicians) to have one or more of unresolved symptoms, psychosocial concerns, end-of-life issues, progressive illness, or complex needs (i.e., palliative care needs).&quot;</span>
The eligibility criteria were quite broad, including patients with various unresolved symptoms, psychosocial concerns, end-of-life issues, progressive illness, or complex needs related to MS. This represents a relatively pragmatic approach, although limiting to a specific geographic area (South East London) and requiring clinician judgment of palliative care needs adds some explanatory elements.
Score: [4]

Recruitment:
Quotes: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Patients in South East London who were severely affected by MS were referred by clinicians to the trial. After baseline interview, patients were randomly allocated to either a multiprofessional palliative care team (PCT) immediately (fast track) or the control care group who continued best usual care for three months and then were offered the PCT.&quot;</span>
Patients were recruited through referrals from clinicians, which is similar to how patients would be identified for palliative care services in usual care. No additional efforts beyond usual care procedures appear to have been made to recruit patients.

The trial was limited to a single geographic area (South East London), but recruited from multiple clinicians seeing MS patients in that area. This leans more explanatory than recruiting from multiple centers that are representative of a wider usual care setting.

The delivery of palliative care by the PCT appears to be an increase in resources and expertise compared to usual care. Patients in the control group continued usual best practice care. The PCT undertook assessments and provided specialist welfare benefits advice and bereavement support beyond what is likely in usual care.

Interestingly, contrary to initial concerns, input from MS nurses was not lower in the fast-track group—in fact there was a nonsignificant trend for it to be higher.&quot;</span>
There are no details provided on flexibility of the PCT intervention protocol. It seems treatment was recommended after initial assessment, but the degree of flexibility is unclear. Much of the PCT care occurred in patients' homes which suggests some flexibility to adapt to the setting. On balance, there is insufficient information to score this domain.
Score: [NA]

Flexibility (adherence):
The full text does not mention any information about flexibility in how participants could engage with or adhere to the palliative care intervention. This domain does not appear to be applicable, as the intervention was a service provided to patients rather than requiring particular adherence on their part.

We conducted face-to-face interviews with patients and gave self-complete questionnaires to caregivers. At baseline, we collected demographic and clinical data, and the patient’s functional status (both self-report, using the United Kingdom Neurological Disability Scale [UNDS] 22 and interviewer-assessed using the Expanded Disability Status Scale [EDSS], 23 administered by a consultant neurologist [E.

The primary palliative care outcome measures (POS-8, pain score, caregiver burden) are directly relevant to patients and caregivers. However, using standardized questionnaires and scales represents a more explanatory approach than would typically be captured in routine usual care.

Primary analysis:
Quotes: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;We planned an intention-to-treat analysis, irrespective of whether patients were assessed as having palliative care needs or the nature of contact with the PCT. We tested the differences between the two arms (expressed as differences between follow-up and baseline interviews) using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), checking statistical assumptions and adjusting for baseline scores. Our primary point of analysis was at 12 weeks (before the control group received the PCT).&quot;</span>
The primary analysis was planned as an intention-to-treat analysis, which is a pragmatic approach that includes all randomized participants regardless of their contact with the intervention. However, the analysis used ANOVA adjusting for baseline scores, which is a more explanatory approach than would be used in usual care settings.

Eligibility:
Quotes: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Eligibility criteria for patients: diagnosis RRMS since at least one year, EDSS score ≤4.0, no symptoms suggestive of a relapse, no relapse in the preceding four weeks, willing and capable of participating in the investigations, and having access to the internet.&quot;</span>
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The study population was low-disability RRMS patients with or without support partner.&quot;</span>

The eligibility criteria are fairly pragmatic, including low-disability RRMS patients diagnosed at least one year ago with EDSS ≤4.0 and no recent relapses. This represents a typical population that would receive the intervention in usual care. However, the requirement for internet access and willingness/capability to participate in investigations is slightly more restrictive than usual care.
Score: [4]

Recruitment:
Quotes: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants were recruited from all over the Netherlands by the patient organisation NMSF, Rotterdam, the Netherlands. Interested patients were contacted by a registered nurse experienced in MS (MH) by phone to check diagnosis and eligibility criteria.&quot;</span>

Patients were recruited from all over the Netherlands by the patient organization NMSF, which is similar to how recruitment would occur in usual care. However, having a registered MS nurse contact patients by phone to check eligibility is a bit more effort than would typically be done in usual care recruitment.
Score: [4]

Setting:
Quotes: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;We did a single-centre, randomized (1:1), unmasked, parallel-group, controlled trial in the Netherlands.&quot;</span>

The trial was conducted at a single center in the Netherlands. While this is not explicitly stated to be different from a usual care setting, conducting the trial at a single center is likely somewhat more explanatory than the variety of settings that would be used for this intervention in usual care.
Score: [3]

Organization:
Quotes: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The multidisciplinary team included a psychiatrist, psychiatric nurse, neurologist, registered nurse specialized in MS, physiotherapist, dance therapist, and a person with MS [9]. All professional team members were formally trained in their respective disciplines and all members were experienced in the field of MS. The person with MS had experience with chronic symptoms and multiple disease-modifying treatments.&quot;</span>
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The members respected and understood the participants' individual qualities and differences, and they stimulated, defied and confronted them to explore and push their boundaries [9].&quot;</span>

The trial used a multidisciplinary team including several specialists (psychiatrist, MS nurse, physiotherapist, dance therapist, person with MS) who were all formally trained and experienced in MS care. This level of expertise and organization is likely beyond what would be consistently available in usual care. The team also made extra efforts to understand and motivate participants that go beyond usual care.
Score: [2] 

Flexibility (delivery):
Quotes: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;CDT focuses on the exploration of those stressors that confine patients to their physical, psychological or social roles regarding their disease and limitations; reduces relevant stressors; explores and pushes personal boundaries by making optimal use of the existing potential [9].&quot;</span>
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;After having identified and formulated individual stressors and aims, participants sign in for one or more group consultations, during which they verify whether their aims are realizable by asking the members of the multidisciplinary team for aim-related medical information [9].&quot;</span>

The delivery of the social cognitive treatment allowed flexibility to focus on each patient's individual stressors and goals. Participants could sign up for group consultations to get input on their personal aims. This suggests a good degree of flexibility in delivery tailored to each patient. However, the use of the full multidisciplinary team to provide input goes a bit beyond the flexibility likely in usual care.
Score: [4]

Flexibility (adherence):
No relevant quotes found. The intervention did not seem to have any particular requirements for participant adherence, as patients could flexibly choose which group sessions to attend. However, not enough information is provided to determine if adherence flexibility was greater than usual care.

The primary endpoint was at 6 months, with additional assessments at baseline, 1 month, and 3 months. This is more frequent follow-up than would be typical in usual care for this chronic condition. Additionally, the use of the Caregiver Strain Index at 6 months to assess strain on support partners is an additional follow-up measure beyond usual care.
Score: [2]

Primary outcome:
Quotes: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The primary study outcome was the change in control self-efficacy, assessed by the Multiple Sclerosis Self-Efficacy Scale (MSSES), at six months [12]. The MSSES is a specific and sensitive self-report questionnaire consisting of two 9-items subscales for control and functional self-efficacy, with a high internal consistency and test-retest reliability [12].&quot;</span>

The primary outcome was control self-efficacy, assessed by the Multiple Sclerosis Self-Efficacy Scale, which is a specific patient-reported outcome measure designed for MS. This outcome is relevant to participants. However, the MSSES is a specialized questionnaire that would not routinely be used to assess this outcome in usual MS care.

The primary analysis was a multiple regression adjusting for baseline characteristics. It defined improvement as an increase of at least 75 points (0.5 SD) on the MSSES-C scale compared to baseline. This is a reasonable definition of improvement, but is somewhat more generous than a strict intention-to-treat analysis. 15-20% of randomized patients were not included in the 6-month analysis.

The CBT intervention followed a manualized approach with 8 weekly modules focused on specific CBT principles and strategies. While some tailoring was done based on participant needs, the overall delivery appears to be quite structured and less flexible than typical therapy in usual care. This suggests an explanatory approach to flexibility of delivery.

Primary analysis:
Quotes: No relevant quotes identified. The paper does not explicitly state whether the primary analysis was intention-to-treat or per-protocol.

Insufficient information is provided to determine how pragmatic vs explanatory the primary analysis was. Key details about inclusion/exclusion of participants are missing.
Score: [NA]

In summary, this trial had very explanatory scores for setting and organization, and moderately explanatory scores in most other domains that could be evaluated. No domains were rated as clearly pragmatic. Flexibility of adherence and primary analysis could not be scored due to lack of information. The overall approach leans heavily towards the explanatory end of the pragmatic-explanatory continuum.</pre>

Eligibility:
Quotes: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Thirty-two participants with multiple sclerosis randomized into intervention or control groups.&quot;</span> <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Potential participants were excluded if they had experienced exacerbation of their multiple sclerosis symptoms three months prior to the study, or had any medical condition which may preclude them from taking part in the exercise intervention.&quot;</span>
The trial had some exclusion criteria related to recent MS exacerbations and medical conditions that could prevent exercise participation. However, the criteria seem reasonable and not overly restrictive compared to what would be used in usual care for this population. The number of participants (32) also suggests the criteria were not extremely narrow.
Score: [4]

Recruitment:
Quotes: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Of the 873 patients on the clinical register for multiple sclerosis 159 patients were deemed suitable for the study. These people were sent invitation letters and participant information sheets. Forty-three potential participants expressed an interest in participating.&quot;</span>
Recruitment was done by sending invitation letters to potentially suitable participants identified from a clinical register. This is a bit more effort than would be used in usual care, but still a relatively pragmatic approach, as the letters were sent to people already on the register, not a broader untargeted recruitment effort.
Score: [4]

Setting:
Quotes: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Two community leisure centres.&quot;</span>
The intervention was delivered in community leisure centres, which is likely a very similar setting to where such an exercise program would take place in usual care.
Score: [5]

Organization:
Quotes: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The intervention group received 12 weeks of twice weekly, 60-minute group exercise sessions, including mobility, balance and resistance exercises. The control group received usual care.&quot;</span>
The intervention involved 12 weeks of twice weekly 60-minute group exercise sessions. This is somewhat different from usual care, as the control group received usual care only. The intervention required additional organization of the exercise sessions.
Score: [3] 

Flexibility (delivery):
Quotes: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The intervention group received 12 weeks of twice weekly, 60-minute group exercise sessions, including mobility, balance and resistance exercises.&quot;</span>
The intervention followed a defined protocol of 60-minute group exercise sessions twice weekly for 12 weeks. However, the exercises included mobility, balance and resistance, allowing some flexibility in the specific exercises. The delivery flexibility seems somewhere between very explanatory and very pragmatic.
Score: [3]

Flexibility (adherence):
Quotes: <span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 99.7%):

For the primary outcome measure, the Timed 25-Foot Walk Test, the ANOVA results demonstrated no statistically significant difference over time (Table 2). Although there was no statistically significant improvement in the Timed 25-Foot Walk Test the mean scores improved by 7.2 seconds (24%) in the intervention group compared with the 3 seconds (19%) in the control group.' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;For the primary outcome measure, the Timed 25-Foot Walk Test, the ANOVA results demonstrated no statistically significant difference over time (Table 2). Although there was no statistically significant improvement in the Timed 25-Foot Walk Test, the mean scores improved by 7.2 seconds (24%) in the intervention group compared with the 3 seconds (19%) in the control group.&quot;</span>
The analysis mentions adherence descriptively, noting the mean improvement in scores, but does not seem to exclude participants based on adherence. This suggests a pragmatic approach to adherence flexibility.
Score: [4]

Follow-up:
Quotes: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Outcome measures were carried out within the local hospital's rehabilitation unit.

Outcome measures were assessed at the hospital's rehab unit at baseline, 8 weeks and 12 weeks. This is more frequent follow-up than would be typical in usual care. The primary outcome of the Timed 25-Foot Walk Test is a standard measure but not one routinely used in usual care.

Primary outcome:
Quotes: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The Timed 25-Foot Walk Test was chosen as the primary outcome measure.&quot;</span>
The primary outcome was the Timed 25-Foot Walk Test, which is a measure of mobility/walking speed. This has clear relevance to multiple sclerosis patients. However, it is not a direct measure of how patients feel, function or survive.
Score: [4]

Primary analysis:
The full text does not provide sufficient details on the primary analysis approach (e.g. intention-to-treat vs per-protocol) to assess this domain.

<pre>
Eligibility:
Quotes: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Specific inclusion criteria were (1) ambulatory (can walk 100 m, be capable of walking 100 metres without a walking aid corresponding to a classification of ⩽5.5 on the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS),10 even if they do use an aid for daily activities; and (2) self-reported to be sedentary or irregularly active at time of study entry (i.e. do not exercise 30 minutes or more twice per week of moderate to vigorous activity).&quot;</span>
The eligibility criteria are quite specific, requiring participants to be ambulatory with EDSS score ≤5.5, and sedentary or irregularly active. This is more restrictive than what would be typical in usual care for people with multiple sclerosis.
Score: [2]

Recruitment:
Quotes: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;People were recruited from four multiple sclerosis clinics in three Canadian cities and from posting on media sites. During the clinic visit, the treating neurologist introduced the study to their patients and referred them to the research assistant who further explained the study and assessed eligibility.&quot;</span>
Recruitment was done through multiple sclerosis clinics and media sites, with neurologists introducing the study to patients. This goes somewhat beyond what would occur in usual care recruitment.
Score: [3]

Setting:
Quotes: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The target population was community dwelling individuals aged 19 to 65 who have been diagnosed after 1994 with multiple sclerosis.&quot;</span>
The study was conducted in a community setting with participants in the target age range for MS. This matches what would be done in usual care.
Score: [5]

Organization:
Quotes: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Two different types of exercise interventions were contrasted. MSTEP©, a personally adapted exercise regimen including a variety of exercises targeting endurance, muscular, and core strength, balance, flexibility, muscular power, and speed of movement. The goal of the MSTEP© programme is to promote regular bouts of activity most days per week, encouraging a balance between rest and activity, and taking into consideration the physical and emotional status and capacity of the person.&quot;</span>
The MSTEP intervention involved a personalized, multimodal exercise program delivered by exercise therapists. The Guideline group received general exercise instructions. This organization goes beyond what would typically be available in usual care.
Score: [2]

Flexibility (delivery):
Quotes: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;On Push Days, participants were instructed to do short bursts of moderate-high intensity exercise to their own tolerance (e.g. for 1–3 minutes) and then reduce to a more comfortable pace for 5–7 minutes and repeat as they are possible.&quot;</span>
The MSTEP intervention allowed flexibility in the intensity and duration of exercise bouts based on the participant's tolerance. However, it still followed a specific protocol of Push and Recovery days. This is more flexible than a strict protocol but less flexible than what would be typical in usual care.
Score: [3]

Flexibility (adherence):
Quotes: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Activity monitoring, a valid way of ascertaining intensity of physical activity for people with multiple sclerosis,22 was carried out using activPAL™, a commercially available device with excellent validity.23 To enhance inter-person reliability, each person was given the same device for repeated measurements.&quot;</span>
Adherence was monitored using an activPAL device for all participants. No mention is made of any measures to improve adherence if found wanting. This represents greater attention to adherence than usual care but without being overly strict.
Score: [3]

Follow-up:
Quotes: <span title='Major quote deviation, possible hallucination. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 73.8%):

The intention was to follow participants for the first year of the intervention when the exercise programme was designed and adjusted as needed' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: red'>&quot;The intention was to follow participants for the first year of the intervention when the exercise programme was designed and adjusted as needed and have a further follow-up after the second year.&quot;</span>
Follow-up extended to 2 years after the initial 12-month intervention period. This is longer and more intensive than the follow-up that would typically occur in usual care after an exercise program.
Score: [2] 

Primary outcome:
Quotes: <span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 98.3%):

Primary outcome was peak oxygen consumption (VO 2peak ) at 12 months; secondary outcomes were composite measures of physical function, fatigue, and health-related quality of life.' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;The primary outcome was peak oxygen consumption (VO2peak) at 12 months; secondary outcomes were composite measures of physical function, fatigue, and health-related quality of life.&quot;</span>
The primary outcome of VO2peak at 12 months is a physiological measure that would not normally be assessed in usual care. The secondary outcomes of physical function, fatigue and quality of life are more relevant to participants.
Score: [2]

Primary analysis:
Quotes: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The primary analysis was of the proportion of people making an absolute improvement at the final time point, 12 months. The planned sample size was 240, 120 per group, based on 80% power, significance level of 0.05, and a hypothesized 20% response in the Guideline group and a 50% response in the MSTEP© group.9 A mixed effects model was used to analyse the results on average change in the primary outcome VO2peak.&quot;</span>
The primary analysis was done at 12 months on the absolute improvement. A mixed effects model was used to analyze the change in VO2peak. Missing data were imputed with 11 imputations. This represents a fairly pragmatic intention-to-treat approach, using all available data with imputation for missing data.

Quotes: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Subjects: Thirty people moderately to severely affected by MS (Extended Disability Status Score, EDSS, 6.5–8) were randomized to an intervention or control group.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: The trial included participants with moderate to severe MS, with EDSS scores between 6.5 and 8. This represents a moderately pragmatic approach, as it includes a specific subgroup of MS patients rather than all MS patients that would be seen in usual care. However, the EDSS eligibility criteria are likely routinely assessed in usual care.
Score: [3]

Recruitment:
Quotes: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;A total of 91 people were contacted, 41 agreed to participate and were screened. Of this group 11 were excluded; three people had poor cognition with a Mini Mental State Examination score less than 23, four had EDSS scores outside the required range, three were receiving regular physiotherapy and one person was unable to commit to the programme (see Figure 1).&quot;</span>
Reasoning: Potential participants were contacted and screened for eligibility. Those meeting criteria were invited to participate. This represents a moderately pragmatic approach, as some effort beyond usual care was made to recruit and screen potential participants. However, it does not appear that extraordinary efforts like targeted mailings or advertising were used.

Setting:
Quotes: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Setting: Community; subjects' homes.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: The intervention was delivered in the participants' homes. This is a highly pragmatic approach that matches the setting of usual care for this population.
Score: [5]

Organization:
Quotes: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The intervention group received twice weekly, home-based physiotherapy for eight weeks and the control group received usual care.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: The intervention involved a specialized physiotherapy program delivered by an experienced physiotherapist. This represents a somewhat explanatory approach, as it requires additional resources and expertise beyond what is typically available in usual care. However, the physiotherapy was delivered in subjects' homes, which is more pragmatic.

Reasoning: The intervention allowed some flexibility in the specific activities performed based on the participant's goals. However, the sessions were structured with specific types of exercises and equipment. This represents a balanced approach between full flexibility and rigid standardization.
Score: [3]

Flexibility (adherence):
Quotes: No relevant quotes identified.

Follow-up:
Quotes: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The following outcome measures were recorded at baseline, post-intervention (Week 8) and at follow-up (Week 16). Primary outcome measure: Multiple Sclerosis Impact Scale (MSIS29) and secondary outcome measures assessed physical impairment, MS symptoms, quality of life, mood, and disability.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: Follow-up assessments were conducted at 8 weeks (immediately post-intervention) and at 16 weeks. This schedule is more frequent than typical follow-up in usual care, but not excessively burdensome. The 16-week follow-up extends somewhat beyond the intervention period.

One hundred and eighty-nine people consented to take part (68%).&quot;</span>
The trial recruited people with MS living in the community, which is likely very similar to those who would receive the self-care intervention as part of usual care. A fairly high percentage (68%) of those invited consented to participate. No major exclusion criteria are mentioned. This suggests the eligibility was quite pragmatic.

Participants were recruited by inviting people with MS to volunteer through MS voluntary organizations. This approach leverages existing community channels and seems similar to how participants might be engaged in usual care, as opposed to more explanatory approaches like targeted invitations or advertising. However, the full details of the recruitment process are not provided.

The trial was conducted with participants living in the community, which is likely identical to the setting of usual care. No details are provided on the specific trial sites or centers used. The lack of exclusion criteria and sole inclusion criterion of a community-based MS diagnosis confirmed by the GP suggests the setting was highly pragmatic, but more details would be needed for a definitive assessment.
Score: [4]

Organization:
Quotes: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The intervention comprised discussion of self-care based on client priorities, using an information booklet about self-care.&quot;</span> <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The discussions lasted between 1 and 2 hours and were conducted on two occasions, over a one month period.&quot;</span>
The intervention involved 1-2 hours of discussion on two occasions over one month, aided by an information booklet. This is somewhat more than what would likely occur in usual care, but does not require major additional resources, staff, or training. The organization appears to be largely pragmatic but not identical to usual care.

The delivery involved some flexibility, with discussions lasting 1-2 hours over 2 sessions in a 1 month period. The information booklet covered many domains and topics, allowing some tailoring to individuals' interests and concerns. However, the 2 session structure over 1 month appears to be a fixed protocol. Overall the delivery flexibility seems intermediate between very explanatory and very pragmatic.
Score: [3]

Flexibility (adherence):
There are no relevant quotes about monitoring or promoting participants' adherence to the self-care intervention. Participants engaged in 1-2 hour discussions but did not have to adhere to any specific behaviors after that.
Score: [NA] 

Follow-up:

However, at follow-up the intervention group had better SF-36 health scores, in mental health (p = 0.04), and vitality (p = 0.05) and considered help with daily activities to be less essential, as measured by the SDDR (p = 0.04), than the control group.&quot;</span>
Participants were assessed at baseline and again after 6 months. The 6-month follow-up is likely longer than what would occur in usual care for this type of self-care intervention. The range of follow-up measures is also more extensive than usual care. However, the timing and measures do not seem as burdensome as some explanatory trials.
Score: [3]

Primary outcome:
Quotes: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;A range of physical and psychological scales was included in order to obtain a comprehensive evaluation of the intervention. Total scores on a postal version of the Barthel Index,11 a scale measuring mobility,12 the United Kingdom version of the SF-3613 and one measure developed for the study; the Standard Day Dependency Record (SDDR), were the main outcome measures.&quot;</span>
The trial used a range of physical and psychological outcome measures that appear to be important to participants, including mobility, activities of daily living, and quality of life. This suggests a pragmatic approach. However, the development of a new scale specifically for the study (the SDDR) is less pragmatic. Overall the primary outcomes seem to be a mix of pragmatic and explanatory.

The trial used random number tables for allocation and had a high completion rate of 92.3%. However, the analysis excluded 6 participants who were randomized but did not begin the study. It's not explicitly stated that intention-to-treat analysis was used. Given the high completion rate, the analysis appears to be fairly pragmatic, but not as pragmatic as a full intention-to-treat approach.

Inclusion criteria were: having MS (MacDonald criteria); being able to complete a questionnaire; and being in need for a multidisciplinary approach, defined by the requirement, in addition to the neurology specialist, of at least two different medical (rehabilitation specialist, neuro-urology specialist, psychiatrist) or allied health professionals (physiotherapist, occupational therapist, social worker, psychologist, and neuropsychologist).&quot;</span>
Reasoning: The eligibility criteria are somewhat stricter than what would be used in usual care, requiring patients to have MS, be able to complete a questionnaire, need a multidisciplinary approach, and require at least two different medical or allied health professionals. However, the criteria are not overly strict and would likely capture a majority of MS patients needing multidisciplinary care.

Reasoning: Patients were recruited prospectively from the outpatient clinic of the hospital's neurology department. This is a very pragmatic approach that mirrors how patients would be recruited in usual care, without any extra effort or routes that would not normally be used.
Score: [5]

Setting:
Quotes: No relevant quotes identified. The setting is not explicitly described beyond being the outpatient clinic of a hospital neurology department.
Reasoning: Insufficient information is provided to determine how different the trial setting is from the usual care setting. It's unclear if this outpatient neurology clinic has any specialized features that differ from a typical clinic seeing MS patients.
Score: [NA] 

Organization:
Quotes: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;An integrated intervention within a multidisciplinary outpatient clinic gathering the different team members is thought to offer the best management of MS. However, whether this multidisciplinary approach is more beneficial for the patient than more usual type of care, where interventions are not integrated but proposed through successive referrals to needed medical and allied health professionals, is unknown.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: The integrated multidisciplinary clinic involves gathering different team members to provide coordinated care, in contrast to usual successive referrals to individual providers. This suggests the resources and organization of care delivery differ from usual practice.
Score: [2]

Flexibility (delivery):
Quotes: No relevant quotes identified. The flexibility of the intervention delivery is not described.
Reasoning: There is insufficient information provided to assess how the flexibility of intervention delivery compares to usual care. No details are given about the protocol for delivering the multidisciplinary care.

For patients in the IMD group, the multidisciplinary integrated outpatient clinic was planned at our MS clinic within a maximum three-month period after inclusion.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: Follow-up in the IMD group occurred within 3 months at the MS clinic. For the control group it occurred over an unspecified timeframe at different times and sites with non-integrated providers. This suggests follow-up was more intensive and structured in the IMD group compared to usual care, but the difference is not drastic.

patients with clinically definite multiple sclerosis were studied. They were randomised in a ratio 2:1 to an intervention group (133) or a control group (68).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ff9e81'>&quot;Ninety-seven consecutive patients with clinically definite multiple sclerosis were studied. They were randomised in a ratio 2:1 to an intervention group (133) or a control group (68).&quot;</span>
Reasoning: The study included 97 consecutive patients with clinically definite multiple sclerosis. This represents a fairly broad inclusion criteria without many exclusions that would differ from usual care. However, the full inclusion/exclusion criteria are not provided, so it's unclear if there were additional criteria that differed from usual care.
Score: [4]

Recruitment:
Quotes: No relevant quotes identified.
Reasoning: The full text does not provide any information on how patients were recruited for the trial. Without knowing if recruitment was done through usual care visits or required extra effort, this domain cannot be scored.
Score: [NA]

Setting:
Quotes: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Rome service area. Eligible patients were assessed for suitability by the coordinator of the home based care team (LP). Written informed consent was obtained for entry into the trial from the patients and, when appropriate, from their carers.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: The trial was conducted in the Rome service area, implying it took place in a usual care setting. Patients were assessed by the home care team coordinator, also suggesting the setting was similar to usual care. However, no further details are provided on the exact setting.
Score: [4]

Organization:
Quotes: <span title='Moderate quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 94.8%):

After 5 pm and during the weekend an answering machine was on, and recorded messages were regularly listened to by the operator. The home based care multidisciplinary team included two neurologists, a urologist, a rehabilitation physician, a psychologist, a physical therapist, a nurse, a social worker, and a coordinator.' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ff9e81'>&quot;After 5 pm and during weekends and holidays the telephone was on, and recorded messages were regularly listened to by the operator. The home based care multidisciplinary team included two neurologists, a urologist, a rehabilitation physician, a psychologist, a physical therapist, a nurse, a social worker, and a coordinator.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: The intervention involved a multidisciplinary home care team available 24/7 to address patient needs. This level of organization and expertise seems to exceed what would typically be available in usual care for multiple sclerosis patients.
Score: [2]

Flexibility (delivery):
Quotes: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Patients randomised to routine hospital care were followed as usual in the multiple sclerosis referral centres. A brief monitoring phone call once a month was used to obtain information about the patient's medical visits and hospital admissions in the previous month.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: For the intervention group, no information is provided on flexibility of delivery. The control group received routine hospital care, but also had a monthly monitoring phone call, which is likely more than usual care. Overall there is insufficient information to score this domain.
Score: [NA] 

Flexibility (adherence):
Quotes: No relevant quotes identified.
Reasoning: The study does not discuss any measures of participant adherence to the intervention or if adherence differed between groups. There is not enough information provided to score this domain.
Score: [NA]

Follow-up:
Quotes: <span title='Major quote deviation, possible hallucination. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 63.6%):

Reasoning: Follow-up assessments were done at baseline and 12 months. This appears to be a typical follow-up schedule for a 1-year study and is likely similar to usual care follow-up intensity.
Score: [4]

Primary outcome:
Quotes: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Functional outcomes were calculated as the mean change of scores from baseline to the final follow up at 12 months. No significant differences between intervention and control groups were detected for outcome measures, including EDSS, FIM, MMSE, CDQ, FSS, STAI, and STAXI.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: The primary outcomes were functional status measures that appear highly relevant to multiple sclerosis patients. The measures include disability (EDSS), quality of life (FIM), cognition (MMSE), depression (CDQ), and fatigue (FSS) - all important outcomes for this population.

Reasoning: The trial included treatment-naïve Multiple Sclerosis patients with persistent foot drop, which is a specific subpopulation. However, no additional exclusion criteria or selection tests not used in usual care were mentioned. The eligibility criteria are somewhat more restrictive than what would be used in usual care for this condition.

Reasoning: Participants were recruited from multiple outpatient centers across Scotland, which likely represents the usual care setting for this population. Using multiple typical practice settings suggests a pragmatic approach.
Score: [4]

Organization:
Quotes: No relevant quotes identified.
Reasoning: The full text does not describe the resources, provider expertise, or organization of care delivery in the intervention arm and how they compare to usual care. There is insufficient information to determine if the trial used additional resources or provider expertise beyond what is typical in usual care.

Reasoning: The study followed participants for 12 months, but the intensity of follow-up is not described in detail. Five participants withdrew before the baseline assessment, but it's unclear if this attrition rate differs from usual care. There is insufficient information to determine how pragmatic or explanatory the follow-up was compared to usual care.

Reasoning: The primary outcome was walking speed, which is an outcome that is directly relevant and important to patients with foot drop due to Multiple Sclerosis. A patient-centered, pragmatic outcome measure was used.
Score: [5]

Primary analysis:
Quotes: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Eighty-five participants met the criteria for inclusion and consented to participate in the study between September 2014 and January 2017 (Figure 1, and the baseline demographic data are detailed in Table 1. Thirty three participants dropped out over the course of the study and although there was no statistically significant difference in drop-out rates between the groups, the proportion was higher in the ankle-foot orthoses group.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: While the primary analysis included all 85 participants who were randomized, 33 participants (39%) dropped out over the course of the 12 month study. The high drop-out rate and lack of detail on how missing data was handled suggests the analysis may lean more explanatory than pragmatic.

The primary outcomes of quality of life and symptom burden are highly relevant to patients. The SEIQoL-DW in particular directly measures patient's quality of life priorities. These outcomes do not seem far removed from what would be collected in routine care.

Reasoning: The trial included participants who would likely receive the intervention as part of usual care, with only those who recently attended a fatigue management program being excluded. This suggests a pragmatic approach to eligibility, though the exclusion of recent fatigue program attendees makes it not maximally pragmatic.

The eligibility criteria are somewhat selective, excluding those currently in rehabilitation/therapy, those unable to do PA without risk factors, and those outside the 18-65 age range. However, the participants are still recruited from hospitals where they receive normal MS outpatient services. The criteria strike a balance between explanatory and pragmatic.

The trial required oversight from research ethics committees and a national regulatory agency, which differs from usual care. Measurements were carried out at two timepoints, which may involve more organizational effort than usual. However, the intervention itself was delivered by an internet application, which may not require much additional organization. Overall, the organization has some explanatory elements but is still reasonably close to usual care.

Effects of practicing were unrelated to degree of impairment (i.e., EDSS level).&quot;</span>

The primary outcomes of mobility, fatigue and impact of MS on patients' lives appear to be important to participants. The measures used (6MWT, MFIS, MSIS-29) are validated instruments that do not require major additional expertise beyond usual MS care. This represents a pragmatic approach.

In the Mazes subtest we measured and evaluated the time for the completion of maze tasks with increasing difficulties.&quot;</span>
The use of a psychologist to administer executive function tests before and after the intervention is more extensive follow-up than would typically occur in usual care. The frequency is not clear but having the same psychologist perform testing suggests it was beyond usual follow-up.
Score: [2]

Primary Outcome:
Quotes: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Objectives: Spasticity, cognitive impairment, depression and fatigue significantly reduce the quality of life in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients. To find out whether nonpharmalogical treatment approaches can reduce these symptoms we investigated effects of sports climbing (SC) and yoga on spasticity, cognitive impairment, mood change and fatigue in MS patients.&quot;</span>
The primary outcomes of spasticity, cognitive function, mood and fatigue are relevant to MS patients. However, some of the measures like the psychologist-administered executive function tests may be less directly meaningful to participants than measures of daily activities or quality of life would be.

Eligibility:
Quotes: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;MS patients older than 18 years who had a confirmed MS with spasticity of the lower limbs and an Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS)9 score between 4 and 6.5 were eligible for inclusion. Patients who had received hippotherapy within the last 12 months, a body weight over 90 kg, no balance while sitting, and acute exacerbation during the 4-week period before start of the therapy were excluded.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: The trial had some exclusion criteria like EDSS score range, recent hippotherapy, high body weight, poor balance, and recent exacerbation that differ from the typical MS population seen in usual care. However, the key inclusion criteria of confirmed MS with lower limb spasticity are quite broad and reflective of the usual care population.
Score: [3]

Recruitment:
Quotes: No relevant quotes identified.
Reasoning: The full text does not provide any details on the recruitment methods used in the trial and how they compare to usual care recruitment. There is insufficient information to assess this domain.
Score: [NA] 

Setting:
Quotes: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;A total of 70 adults with MS were recruited in five German centers and randomly allocated to the intervention group (12 weeks of hippotherapy) or the control group.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: The trial was conducted at five centers in one country (Germany). While this is more reflective of usual care than a single center trial, it still may not fully represent the range of settings that MS patients are treated in as part of usual care.
Score: [3]

Organization:
Quotes: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Hippotherapy as a complementary treatment can be defined as one-patient-one-horse physiotherapy treatment with and on the horse. The primary goals of hippotherapy are regulating muscle tone (reduction in spasticity) and breathing, strengthening the torso muscles, improving balance control and coordination, as well as gait. In addition, hippotherapy promotes social communication in the patients' lives and strengthens their self-esteem.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: The hippotherapy intervention involved specialized training and a one-on-one patient to horse/therapist ratio that likely requires greater resources and expertise than is typically available in usual care. However, hippotherapy is an established complementary therapy for MS, so the organization is not completely foreign to usual care.

Over the study period, symptomatic drug treatment, immunotherapy, and physiotherapy were kept unchanged in both groups.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: The intervention followed a defined protocol of 12 weekly hippotherapy sessions, but allowed participants' standard care to continue unchanged. This represents a moderate level of flexibility in delivery compared to usual care.
Score: [3]

Flexibility (adherence):
Quotes: No relevant quotes identified. 
Reasoning: The study does not report any information on measures taken to monitor or enforce participant adherence to the hippotherapy intervention. Adherence flexibility cannot be assessed based on the details provided.
Score: [NA]

Follow-up:
Quotes: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Examinations and questionnaires were completed prior to the first hippotherapy session (baseline), after 6–7 weeks (interim assessment) and after 12 weeks (final assessment). Physiotherapists who assessed the endpoints in a separate room were blinded and explicitly trained not to question patients or hippotherapists. Patients were individually instructed to keep confidentiality of their allocation group.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: Participants underwent an assessment at baseline, 6-7 weeks, and 12 weeks. This is more intensive follow-up than would be typical in usual care. Physiotherapists performing the assessments were also blinded which differs from usual care.

Reasoning: The primary outcome was change in Berg Balance Scale from baseline to 12 weeks. This is a patient-relevant outcome that assesses balance, an important symptom for MS patients. The Berg Balance Scale is a standard, well-established measure that would likely be used in usual care as well.

Reasoning: The primary analysis was conducted on a modified intention-to-treat population that included all randomized participants with a valid baseline measurement. Missing data was handled using last observation carried forward. While not as rigorous as a full intention-to-treat analysis, this represents a reasonable compromise between pragmatic and explanatory approaches.

Fifty patients with relapsing MS, followed at the Jacobs MS Center for Treatment and Research, Department of Neurology, University at Buffalo, Buffalo New York, USA, were enrolled in this study. Inclusion criteria consisted of: a diagnosis of relapsing MS according to McDonald criteria, 19 being on natalizumab therapy for 24 months or longer, aged between 18 and 65 years and an EDSS score of ≤7.0. 20 Candidates were excluded from the study if active disease was identified at baseline per clinical ( presence of a relapse during the previous 30 days) and/or MRI evaluation (active gadolinium (Gd)-enhancing lesions).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;Fifty patients with relapsing MS, followed at the Jacobs MS Center for Treatment and Research, Department of Neurology, University at Buffalo, Buffalo New York, USA, were enrolled in this study. Inclusion criteria consisted of: a diagnosis of relapsing MS according to McDonald criteria,1,2 being on natalizumab therapy for 24 months or longer, aged between 18 and 65 years and an EDSS score of ≤7.0.30 Candidates were excluded from the study if active disease was identified at baseline per clinical (presence of a relapse during the previous 30 days) and/or MRI evaluation (active gadolinium (Gd)-enhancing lesions).&quot;</span>
The eligibility criteria are somewhat stricter than what would be used in usual care for MS patients on natalizumab. The study excluded patients with active disease in the past 30 days or Gd-enhancing lesions on baseline MRI, as well as those with EDSS > 7.0. While these criteria help obtain a more homogeneous sample, they are more restrictive than the usual care setting which would include a broader MS population on natalizumab.

The study recruited participants from a single MS center. No additional details are provided on the recruitment methods. Recruiting from a specialized MS center is likely not too different from how natalizumab patients would be recruited in usual care, but the lack of details makes it difficult to assess how pragmatic the recruitment was.

For the TG, the MRI schedule was: baseline, 6 and 12 months after the last infusion.&quot;</span>
The study used a standardized MRI protocol with a fixed schedule, which is likely more structured than what is done in usual care. However, the use of MRI to monitor patients discontinuing natalizumab is not too different from usual practice.

IDG: Patients who discontinued natalizumab therapy at once and initiated another DMT (interferon, GA therapy or an oral DMTfingolimod, dimethyl fumatate or teriflunomide) at 1–6 months following the last natalizumab infusion (1–2 months for the injectable DMTs and 3–6 months for the oral DMTs) and tapered group (TG): patients administered two additional natalizumab infusions, one at 6 weeks and one at 8 weeks (14 weeks from study entry).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;IDG: Patients who discontinued natalizumab therapy at once and initiated another DMT (interferon, GA therapy or an oral DMT: fingolimod, dimethyl fumarate or teriflunomide) at 1–6 months following the last natalizumab infusion (1–2 months for the injectable DMTs and 3–6 months for the oral DMTs) and tapered group (TG): patients administered two additional natalizumab infusions, one at 6 weeks and one at 8 weeks (14 weeks from study entry).&quot;</span>
The study had two predefined treatment protocols (immediate discontinuation with another DMT or a short taper) with specific timelines. This is more rigid than the flexibility likely in usual care where the transition plan after stopping natalizumab would be individualized.

Inclusion criteria were the following: diagnosis of MS made by a neurologist, able to walk 10 meters with or without an aid within 2 minutes, no relapse of their MS in the past 4 weeks, and no other neurological or orthopedic condition that would affect their function.&quot;</span>
The eligibility criteria were fairly broad, including anyone with a diagnosis of MS who could walk 10m within 2 minutes and had no relapse in the past 4 weeks. This is similar to the population that would receive the intervention as part of usual care. The only additional criteria were no other neurological/orthopedic conditions affecting function, which may be a bit more restrictive than usual care.

The trial recruited overweight/obese male hockey fans from two specific teams in Ontario. While this represents the population of interest, the eligibility criteria are more restrictive than what would be used in usual care, as they focus on a specific demographic group.

The pregnant women were randomly divided into three groups at a university hospital in the suburbs of Sao Paulo, Brazil, in order to receive either acupressure treatment, a placebo or participate as part of a control group.&quot;</span>
The eligibility criteria are quite broad, including pregnant women at 37+ weeks with cervical dilation ≥4cm and 2+ contractions in 10 minutes. This represents a fairly typical population that would receive acupressure during labor in usual care. However, the study was conducted at a single university hospital in Sao Paulo, which may limit generalizability somewhat compared to a wider range of usual care settings.

Recruitment was done through sequential allocation from a list of random numbers, which is similar to how patients would be enrolled in usual care. No additional efforts beyond usual care procedures were made to recruit participants.

The trial was conducted at a single university hospital in Sao Paulo. While this is a real-world setting, the restriction to one center makes the setting somewhat different from the full spectrum of usual care settings where acupressure might be used during labor.
Score: [3]

Organization:
Quotes: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The study was evaluated and approved by the Ethics Committee on Local Research (Opinion Case Number 182.421). All of the participants in the study agreed to take part in the tests and they signed a consent form demonstrating that they had decided to take part based on their own free will in accordance with the country's laws.&quot;</span>
The study procedures, including obtaining informed consent and following a protocol, likely required some additional training and organization compared to usual care. However, the intervention itself did not require additional resources or changes to the care team.
Score: [3]

Flexibility (delivery):
Quotes: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The acupressure was applied on the sanyinjiao point during the contractions for 20 minutes. Then the intensity of the pain was evaluated using the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS).&quot;</span>
The intervention involved a strict protocol of applying acupressure at SP6 for 20 minutes during contractions and evaluating pain with the VAS. This allowed little flexibility in delivery compared to usual care.
Score: [2]

Flexibility (adherence):
There are no relevant quotes about flexibility of participant adherence to the intervention. Once participants were enrolled and randomized, adherence does not appear to be an issue, as the intervention was delivered by the researchers at a single time point.
Score: [NA] 

Follow-up:

Pain was evaluated using the VAS at three time points: before, immediately after, and 60 minutes after the 20-minute acupressure intervention. This represents a short-term follow-up focused on the intervention period, rather than longer-term outcomes that would be assessed in usual care.
Score: [2]

Primary outcome:

The primary outcome was pain measured by the VAS, which is patient-reported and directly relevant to the women in labor. The VAS is widely used in usual care settings. However, the focus on short-term pain immediately after the intervention is somewhat different from the key labor outcomes that would be prioritized in usual care.

The primary analysis included all participants according to their original group allocation. 44 out of the original 52 in the acupressure group were analyzed for the primary outcome at 60 minutes. While not a full intention-to-treat approach, this represents a largely pragmatic analysis consistent with usual care.

The trial enrolled a broad patient population from primary care and private lung physician offices, with few eligibility criteria other than age and COPD severity. No additional criteria were set for accompanying family members. This suggests the trial population is fairly representative of the patients who would receive the self-management intervention as part of usual care.

The intervention was delivered at a single clinical research center affiliated with a university hospital, rather than across all the primary care and private practice sites from which patients were recruited.

The self-management intervention was an addition to usual care, suggesting it required extra resources and organization compared to usual care alone. It was based on a theoretical framework that was adjusted to the needs of the specific patient population, likely requiring some additional expertise to deliver compared to usual care.

The intervention followed a defined 6-month protocol with 6-month follow-up. While the authors note a need for patient-centered approaches, the description does not explicitly mention flexibility or tailoring of the intervention delivery.

The primary outcomes included a mix of objective measures (carbon monoxide monitoring for smoking abstinence) and self-reported measures (exacerbations, satisfaction, health-related quality of life). The SGRQ-C quality of life measure is a validated and repeatable patient-reported outcome specifically designed for COPD patients. While the self-report measures introduce some subjectivity, overall the outcomes assessed appear to be directly relevant to patients. The use of a COPD-specific QoL measure supports this relevance.

The trial recruited a broad population of asthma patients from general practices, with the main eligibility criteria being adults on the asthma register who had requested a bronchodilator in the past 6 months. This is a fairly pragmatic approach, as it includes a population similar to those who would receive the intervention as part of usual care. However, the requirement for a recent bronchodilator request adds an additional criterion that makes it somewhat less pragmatic than using just the asthma register alone.

Of these 1200 were randomised to either telephone review or face to face consultation with the asthma nurse.&quot;</span>
Patients were recruited from the practices' asthma registers, which is how they would be identified for reviews in usual care. However, they were then randomized to the telephone or face-to-face consultation arms, which differs from usual care where patients would not be randomized. The recruitment process is still largely pragmatic as it occurred through the practices' usual mechanisms.

The trial was conducted across four general practices in England, which is the same setting where asthma reviews would typically occur in usual care. Patients were those who had not been reviewed in the past 11 months, which also reflects the typical population who would be due for an asthma review in primary care.

The intervention was delivered by nurses in the general practices, which matches usual care. The nurses were given no special instructions beyond conducting the reviews as per their normal practice. The only difference from usual care appears to be the 20 minute suggested duration. Overall, the organization of care delivery in the trial closely mirrored usual practice.

The primary outcome data on whether patients were reviewed came from the practices' medical records, which is the same data source that would be used in usual care to track asthma reviews. Additional outcome measures were collected via questionnaires at 3 months, which is a short, pragmatic timeframe, though the questionnaires themselves go beyond what would be typical in usual care follow-up.

The two primary outcomes were the proportion of patients completing an asthma review and the change in asthma-related quality of life. The review completion outcome is highly relevant to participants and is routinely collected in usual care. The quality of life outcome, while important to patients, goes somewhat beyond what would typically be measured in usual care at a routine asthma review.

The primary analysis of asthma review completion was based on medical record data for all randomized participants, which is an intention-to-treat approach using data that would be available in usual care. The analysis of quality of life data may have excluded some participants due to missing questionnaire responses, but still represents a largely pragmatic approach.

<pre>
Eligibility:
Quotes: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The inclusion criteria were: a positive diagnosis of RA (1987 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria); 18 years or older and the ability to complete questionnaires unaided. Exclusions were: unstabilised concomitant disease, awaiting surgery and already receiving care from the practitioners involved in the study.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: The eligibility criteria are somewhat stricter than what would be used in usual care, with some exclusions like unstabilized concomitant disease and already receiving care from the study practitioners. However, the inclusion criteria of a diagnosis of RA and being 18 or older are not overly restrictive compared to usual care.

Reasoning: Patients were recruited through usual care visits and consented to participate, which is similar to how recruitment would occur in usual care. The use of a remote telephone randomization service is a bit more effort than would be typical in usual care.
Score: [4]

Setting:
Quotes: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;This study required three practitioners at each centre; a CNS, a rheumatologist and a blind independent assessor. Nine CNS and 10 rheumatologists delivered the interventions. The CNS had a median experience of 10 years in their current post while the rheumatologists had a median of 9 years at consultant level. The CNS have experience in running nurse-led clinics and usually have a postgraduate qualification in rheumatology nursing and/or prescribing.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: The trial took place at typical rheumatology clinics with experienced practitioners who usually run nurse-led clinics. This setting appears very similar to usual care.

Reasoning: The trial included a broad population of participants, with over half being Indigenous Australians and a majority having established cardiovascular disease. This suggests the eligibility criteria were quite pragmatic and representative of the real-world patient population. However, the full details of the eligibility criteria are not provided, so it's difficult to fully assess how pragmatic they were.

Failure to recruit the planned number of participants reflected insufficient resources to continue enrolment.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: Participants were recruited from a moderately large number of centers, including 12 Aboriginal Medical Services, suggesting recruitment procedures were somewhat pragmatic. However, recruitment had to be stopped early due to insufficient resources, which differs from usual care. Overall, the recruitment procedures appear to be a mix of pragmatic and explanatory elements.

Reasoning: The trial was conducted in primary healthcare centers, which is likely similar to the usual care setting for this patient population. This suggests a pragmatic approach. However, it's unclear if these centers were typical of all primary care centers or if they were specialized trial centers. More details would be needed to give a higher pragmatism score.

Reasoning: The organizational procedures seem to be a mix of pragmatic and explanatory elements. Reviewing participants at 6 month intervals could be part of usual care, but the one month post-randomization review is likely an additional element. Conducting some reviews by telephone is a pragmatic approach. Without more details on how the care was delivered, a moderate score seems appropriate.

Flexibility (delivery):
Quotes: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;At one extreme, patients ineligible for any concessions were charged the standard co-payment (approximately AUD$35/month for each medication). At the other extreme, the polypill was dispensed without charge at Indigenous health services operating under the Section 100 scheme of the National Health Act.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: The flexibility in delivery appears to be quite pragmatic. Patients were charged standard co-payments if ineligible for concessions, but the polypill was dispensed for free to some patients, which mirrors the variability likely in usual care based on insurance status and health service policies. The delivery does not seem to be strictly protocol-driven.

However, since combination BP lowering versus placebo achieves around a 10mmHg systolic BP (SBP) difference in patients with similar BP profiles, this 18% absolute difference would be expected to result in only a 1.8mmHg difference in SBP.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: Adherence to the polypill was encouraged and monitored, with a 18% absolute improvement seen. However, this is described as a <span title='Moderate quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 82.9%):

BP (measured with the Omron 705CP II device) and fasting blood samples (measured at local laboratories) were obtained at baseline, 12 months, 24 months and the final visit.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: The follow-up procedures are more intensive than usual care, with reviews every 6 months, sometimes by telephone but also in-person to obtain BP and blood samples. A one-month post-randomization review was also conducted. This frequency of visits and the one-month review suggest a more explanatory approach to follow-up.

Quotes: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Analyses of change in systolic BP and total cholesterol were conducted using longitudinal linear mixed models including all values collected during follow-up. Models included treatment, visit, treatment-by-visit interaction, and the baseline systolic BP or total cholesterol.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: The use of longitudinal mixed models including all collected values suggests an intent-to-treat approach, which is pragmatic. However, it appears that only participants with baseline and follow-up BP/cholesterol measures were included, rather than all randomized participants. This suggests the analysis may not be as pragmatic as a full intention-to-treat approach.

Eligibility:
Quotes: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;To evaluate the clinical effectiveness of surgical vs nonsurgical treatment for adults with displaced fractures of the proximal humerus involving the surgical neck.&quot;</span>
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;A pragmatic, multicenter, parallel-group, randomized clinical trial, the Proximal Fracture of the Humerus Evaluation by Randomization (PROFHER) trial, recruited 250 patients aged 16 years or older (mean age, 66 years [range, 24-92 years]; 192 [77%] were female; and 249 [99.6%] were white) who presented at the orthopedic departments of 32 acute UK National Health Service hospitals between September 2008 and April 2011 within 3 weeks after sustaining a displaced fracture of the proximal humerus involving the surgical neck.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: The eligibility criteria are quite broad, including adults aged 16 years or older who sustained a displaced proximal humerus fracture involving the surgical neck within 3 weeks. The mean age of 66 years, with 77% being female and 99.6% being white, suggests the study population is representative of the typical patient population for this condition. No additional exclusion criteria are mentioned that would make the study population differ from those treated in usual care.
Score: [5]

Reasoning: Patients were recruited from the orthopedic departments of 32 UK National Health Service hospitals when they presented within 3 weeks of sustaining the fracture. This suggests recruitment occurred through usual care pathways when patients sought treatment for their injury, without extra effort beyond what would occur in usual care.

Nonsurgical treatment was sling immobilization. Standardized outpatient and community-based rehabilitation was provided to both groups.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: The surgical interventions were performed by surgeons already experienced in the procedures, suggesting no additional training or expertise beyond usual care was required. Nonsurgical treatment was sling immobilization, which is a standard treatment. Both groups received standardized rehabilitation in outpatient and community settings, which is likely similar to what would be provided in usual care.

Flexibility (Delivery):
Quotes: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Fracture fixation or humeral head replacement were performed by surgeons experienced in these techniques. Nonsurgical treatment was sling immobilization. Standardized outpatient and community-based rehabilitation was provided to both groups.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: The delivery of surgical and nonsurgical interventions is described in broad terms, without mentioning specific protocols, monitoring procedures, or restrictions on co-interventions that would differ from usual care. Surgeons used techniques they were already experienced in. Standardized rehabilitation was provided but not described in detail. This suggests flexibility in intervention delivery was similar to usual care.
Score: [4]

Flexibility (Adherence):
Quotes: No relevant quotes identified. The study does not discuss participant adherence to the assigned treatments.
Reasoning: There is insufficient information provided to assess how participant adherence was monitored or encouraged compared to usual care. Surgical interventions took place in the hospital, while nonsurgical treatment was sling immobilization, but adherence is not explicitly discussed.
Score: [NA] 

Follow-up:
Quotes: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The data for 231 patients (114 in surgical group and 117 in nonsurgical group) were included in the primary analysis.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: Follow-up assessments were conducted at 6, 12, and 24 months, with retention rates of 93%, 90%, and 86% at those time points. This follow-up schedule is likely somewhat more frequent and intense than what would occur in usual care after proximal humerus fracture. However, the timing of assessments at 6 month intervals is not excessively burdensome.

Primary Outcome:
Quotes: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Primary outcome was the Oxford Shoulder Score (OSS), which is a shoulder-specific outcome measure validated in a UK population.12 The OSS provides a total score based on the patient's subjective assessment of pain and function. It contains 12 items, each with 5 categories of response, and a range of total scores of 0 (worst outcome) to 48 (best outcome).13 The OSS was collected by postal questionnaires at 6, 12, and 24 months.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: The Oxford Shoulder Score is a validated, patient-reported outcome measure assessing shoulder pain and function. It is likely relevant to patients with proximal humerus fractures. Collecting the outcome via postal questionnaires at 6, 12 and 24 months is a pragmatic approach that does not require additional clinic visits. No adjudication of outcomes is mentioned.

This model adjusted for the fixed effects of treatment group, time (6, 12, or 24 months), treatment × time interaction, tuberosity involvement at baseline (yes or no), age (<65 years or ≥65 years), sex, and health status at baseline (EuroQol 5D).

Reasoning: The primary analysis used a mixed-effects model to compare OSS scores between groups over 2 years, accounting for missing data using age, sex and baseline health status. This represents an intention-to-treat approach including all randomized participants. 250 out of 563 eligible patients (44%) consented and were included, which is a fairly high participation rate. Some ineligible patients were excluded due to comorbidities precluding surgery or anesthesia, but the eligible patients were randomized.

2. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Patients were excluded if they: • had experienced ≥3 falls in the previous year; • had unstable clinical conditions; • would be unable to follow instructions about exercise safely; or • were receiving palliative care.&quot;</span>

The trial recruited participants from primary care practices with assistance from research networks. The eligibility criteria were fairly broad, including community-dwelling older adults who were independently mobile and physically able to participate in group exercise. However, there were some exclusions that differ from usual care, such as those with ≥3 falls in the previous year, unstable clinical conditions, inability to follow exercise instructions, or receiving palliative care. These criteria are somewhat more restrictive than the general older adult population seen in usual care.

Recruitment was done through primary care practices with the assistance of research networks, which is similar to how patients would be identified for an intervention in usual care. Patients were identified through searches of computerized medical records and invited to participate, which is a pragmatic approach not requiring much additional effort beyond usual care processes. However, the involvement of research networks to help recruit practices is somewhat beyond what would occur in usual care.

The OEP was undertaken at home, unsupervised, and comprised exercises to be done three times per week.&quot;</span>

The intervention was delivered through general practices in three geographic areas, which is similar to a usual care setting. The group exercise component took place once weekly in this setting, while the home-based component was carried out unsupervised by participants in their homes. Delivering the intervention through general practices and participants' homes closely mirrors a usual care scenario.

Both interventions were delivered for 24 weeks. Participants in the usual-care arm were not offered either programme.&quot;</span>

The interventions were delivered by postural stability instructors for the group classes and volunteer peer mentors for the home-based OEP program. This organization goes somewhat beyond what would be routinely available in usual care, as it requires specialized exercise instructors and organized volunteer support. However, the interventions still utilized existing general practice and community settings and resources. The intensity of organization appears to be intermediate between an explanatory trial and a fully pragmatic approach.

The interventions had specified frequencies for the group classes and home exercises, but these were implemented in relatively flexible community and home-based settings. Participants carried out home exercises unsupervised, allowing for some flexibility in how these were completed. However, the trial protocol did dictate the overall dose and schedule of the interventions, which is less flexible than what might occur in usual care. Usual care participants did not receive either intervention, suggesting some deviation from typical care.

Participants were asked to record falls in daily diaries and adherence was tracked through class registers and self-completion diaries during the intervention period. Follow-up on adherence continued after the intervention ended via diaries and phone interviews. This level of monitoring and follow-up exceeds what would typically occur in usual care. However, no mention is made of excluding participants based on adherence. The adherence procedures are more intensive than usual care but not as rigid as a very explanatory trial focused on adherence.

Participants were followed for 12 months after randomization, with falls data collected continuously through daily diaries. Assessments occurred at baseline, 6 months (intervention end), and 12 months through questionnaires and physical assessments. This frequency of follow-up exceeds what would typically occur in usual care, especially the daily recording of falls. However, the 6 and 12 month assessment schedule is not overly burdensome compared to an intensive explanatory approach. The follow-up procedures are intermediate between very explanatory and very pragmatic.

The primary outcome of falls is highly relevant to the older adult participants, as falls are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in this population. Falls were assessed in a pragmatic way through daily diaries recorded by participants over 12 months. This prospective data collection approach is more intensive than usual care, but the self-reported nature of the outcome keeps it pragmatic and close to how falls might be tracked in a real-world setting.

The primary analysis examined the proportion of participants meeting the target of 150 minutes of falls per person-year during the intervention period. No evidence of a difference between adherers and non-adherers was found, suggesting all participants were included regardless of adherence. While not explicitly stated, this implies an intent-to-treat approach with all available data, which is consistent with a pragmatic analysis. However, some secondary analyses (not extracted here) looked at only adherers or compliers, which is less pragmatic.

This booklet included the measures administered at baseline, the General Health Questionnaire 12 and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, and in addition the BDI-II,6 a measure of the severity of depression.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: The trial used screening questionnaires (GHQ-12 and HADS) to identify eligible participants with low mood, which would not be done as part of usual care. The outcome measures also included questionnaires that go beyond usual care assessments.
Score: [2]

Recruitment:
Quotes: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The CONSORT14 diagram of the recruitment and follow-up of participants is shown in Figure 1.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: The CONSORT diagram shows the flow of participants through the trial. However, no specific details are provided in the text on how recruitment differed from usual care. There is not enough information to assess how pragmatic or explanatory the recruitment was.
Score: [NA]

Setting:

Reasoning: Participants were recruited from a community setting by screening people with multiple sclerosis. This appears to be a setting similar to where the intervention would be delivered in usual care, rather than a specialized trial setting. However, limited details are provided to fully assess this domain.

Reasoning: The primary outcome measures were the EQ-5D quality of life questionnaire and a questionnaire assessing NHS service use and medication to determine costs. These outcomes, especially service use and costs, are relevant to participants, but the EQ-5D is a generic measure not specific to multiple sclerosis.

Eligibility:
Quotes: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The inclusion criteria were being definitely diagnosed with MS and having records in the Society and the exclusion criteria having history of other psychiatric disorders including major depressive disorder (according to the medical records and the physician's examinations) or bipolar disorder (except for cognitive disorders by which MS is characterized), substance dependency, any neurological disorders, history of taking corticosteroids or the disease recurrence within the previous six months.&quot;</span>
The eligibility criteria excluded patients with major psychiatric disorders other than those caused by MS, as well as those with substance dependence, neurological disorders, recent corticosteroid use or disease recurrence. This represents a more explanatory than pragmatic approach, as these criteria are more restrictive than what would likely be used in routine care of MS patients.

Depression, anxiety, stress, and fatigue were measured by Depression Anxiety Stress Scale-21 and Piper Standard Scale before and immediately and three months after the implementation of FHM.&quot;</span>
The full text does not provide details on the recruitment methods used. The number of participants (140) suggests recruitment may have required some efforts beyond routine care, but there is insufficient information to assess how pragmatic or explanatory the recruitment was.

The intervention involved defining concepts, reviewing study results, and teaching techniques for managing depression, stress, anxiety and increasing happiness. This organization of care delivery seems to require additional training and expertise beyond what is typically available in routine care for MS patients.
Score: [2]

Flexibility (delivery):
Quotes: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The intervention was implemented within two days a week. For the control group, a routine protocol was conducted. For blinding, the patients of the control group referred to the Society on certain days of week and those of the experimental on other days.&quot;</span>
The intervention was delivered twice a week on specific days, suggesting a fairly rigid protocol rather than the flexibility that would be seen in routine care. The delivery of the intervention and control on separate days for blinding also points to an explanatory approach.
Score: [2]

Flexibility (adherence):
The full text does not discuss any measures related to participant adherence to the intervention or how it compares to routine care expectations.
Score: [NA]

Follow-up:
Quotes: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Depression, anxiety, stress, and fatigue were measured by Depression Anxiety Stress Scale-21 and Piper Standard Scale before and immediately and three months after the implementation of FHM.&quot;</span>
Participants were assessed with standard questionnaires at baseline, immediately post-intervention, and at 3 months follow-up. This level of follow-up is somewhat more intense than typical for routine MS care, but not overly burdensome. It leans slightly explanatory but still has some pragmatic elements.
Score: [3]

Primary outcome:
Quotes: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Depression, anxiety, stress, and fatigue were measured by Depression Anxiety Stress Scale-21 and Piper Standard Scale&quot;</span>
The primary outcomes of depression, anxiety, stress and fatigue are highly relevant to MS patients and measured using standard questionnaires. This represents a pragmatic approach focusing on outcomes important to patients.
Score: [5]

Participants were recruited via physician referral, targeted mailings to persons with MS on the mailing list of the National MS Society, contact with support groups, and notices in MS newsletters and web sites.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: The trial recruited participants from three large metropolitan communities via various methods including physician referrals, targeted mailings, support groups, and newsletters/websites. This represents a fairly pragmatic approach, as it does not involve extensive exclusion criteria or selection tests not used in usual care. However, recruiting from MS-specific sources like support groups and newsletters may select for a somewhat more engaged MS population compared to usual care.

Reasoning: Recruitment methods included physician referrals, which would be part of usual care. However, the trial also made extra efforts to recruit through targeted mailings to MS society lists, support groups, and MS-specific media. This goes somewhat beyond what would typically occur in usual care for MS.

Reasoning: The intervention was delivered via teleconference or in-person group sessions led by a neuropsychologist. While this is not a highly specialized research setting, it does require some additional resources and organization compared to a typical usual care setting for MS. The involvement of neuropsychologists and structured group sessions represents a slight deviation from usual MS care.

Randomization assignment was recorded on a letter sealed in an opaque envelope. Following the completion of baseline testing, the project manager opened the next envelope in the sequence and assigned the participant to either the active intervention or the usual care comparison group.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: The intervention required neuropsychologists to lead structured 2-hour group sessions for 8 weeks, which goes beyond the resources and expertise typically available in usual MS care. The randomization procedures also required some additional organization compared to usual care. However, the intervention was integrated into participants' regular care rather than being provided as a separate research protocol.

Following approval by the Institutional Review Board for the University of Texas at Austin, participants were recruited from three large metropolitan communities in Texas: Houston, San Antonio and Dallas. Participants were recruited via physician referral, targeted mailings to persons with MS on the mailing list of the National MS Society, contact with support groups, and notices in MS newsletters and web sites.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: The study does not explicitly discuss follow-up intensity. However, based on the sample size calculation and recruitment methods described, it appears the follow-up was more extensive than would typically occur in usual care, in order to achieve sufficient statistical power. Participants were actively followed via mailings, support group contacts, etc.

Reasoning: The primary outcomes were a battery of 5 neuropsychological tests assessing various cognitive domains relevant to MS. These appear to be validated, MS-specific measures that would be meaningful to participants. However, a 70-minute battery of 5 neuropsych tests goes beyond what would typically be assessed in usual care.

Reasoning: The primary analysis appears to be a standard intention-to-treat approach including all randomized participants with available data. There is no mention of excluding participants based on adherence or protocol deviations. Missing data management is not explicitly discussed but does not appear to involve complex imputation methods. This represents a fairly pragmatic approach to analysis.

Inclusion criteria were (1) 18–60 years of age, (2) ⩾2 years since clinical diagnosis with relapsing remitting MS (RRMS) and (3) no relapses or changes in medication status 8 weeks prior to inclusion.&quot;</span>
The eligibility criteria are somewhat stricter than what would be used in usual care, with an upper age limit of 60 and requiring no recent relapses or medication changes. However, the criteria are not overly narrow and patients were recruited from multiple MS clinics, making the population more representative of typical MS patients compared to a highly selective trial population.

The eligibility criteria are somewhat stricter than what would likely be used in usual care for MS patients. The age range is limited to 14-50 years, and there are several exclusion criteria related to comorbidities and abnormal lab values that may not be routinely used to determine MS treatment eligibility in practice. However, the core diagnosis is still based on standard clinical manifestations and MRI findings.

There was no evidence that treatment prevented deterioration or reduced the number or severity of the relapses when compared with 169 control patients observed and scored in a similar way for the same period of time.' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;181 patients with multiple sclerosis were treated with corticotrophin daily for eighteen months. There was no evidence that treatment prevented deterioration or reduced the number or severity of the relapses when compared with 169 control patients observed and scored in a similar way for the same period of time.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: The trial included a broad population of multiple sclerosis patients treated for 18 months and compared to controls observed over the same period. No additional eligibility criteria are mentioned, suggesting the participants are similar to those who would receive the intervention as part of usual care.
Score: [4]

Recruitment:
Quotes: None relevant.
Reasoning: The full text does not provide any details on how participants were recruited for the trial. There is insufficient information to assess how pragmatic or explanatory the recruitment procedures were compared to usual care.
Score: [NA]

Reasoning: The trial was conducted across three cities, but the full text does not specify the exact settings within those cities. It's unclear if the settings mirror those where the intervention would be delivered as part of usual care. More information is needed to fully assess this domain.
Score: [NA] 

Organization:
Quotes: None relevant.
Reasoning: The full text does not describe the resources, expertise or organization of care delivery in the intervention arm compared to usual care. There are no details on any extra staff training, certification or resources provided. Insufficient information is available to score this domain.

She was admitted to hospital on May 6, 1966, in bacteraemic shock; temperature 103°F (39-3°C), pulse-rate 120 per minute, blood-pressure 70/40 mm. Hg. Despite intravenous hydrocortisone and other drugs, the muscular cortisone acetate, and chloromycetin she died the following day.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: The description of modifying the intervention delivery based on a patient's clinical status suggests some flexibility was allowed, similar to usual care. However, the full text lacks other details needed to comprehensively assess the flexibility of intervention delivery compared to usual care.
Score: [3]

Flexibility (adherence):
Quotes: None relevant. 
Reasoning: The publication does not discuss participant adherence to the intervention or if any special measures were used to monitor and enforce compliance that differ from usual care. There is not enough information provided to evaluate the flexibility of participant adherence.
Score: [NA]

Follow-up:
Quotes: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The treated and control groups did not differ either in the amount of deterioration of the disease or in the reduction in number or severity of relapses.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: The trial followed participants for 18 months and compared deterioration and relapse outcomes between groups. This follow-up duration appears similar to what would be done in usual care for a chronic condition like multiple sclerosis. However, the intensity of visits and data collection is not described in detail.
Score: [4]

Primary outcome:
Quotes: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The clinical experience with these patients are similar in general to those recorded at the other centres.

Reasoning: The primary outcomes of deterioration and relapses are relevant to multiple sclerosis patients. Measuring these over an 18 month period also matches the natural history of the condition. The outcomes do not appear to require any special training or central adjudication that differs from usual care assessment of multiple sclerosis patients.

Reasoning: The results mention that some patients had side effects or excessive weight gain, but these participants do not seem to be excluded from the analysis. However, the full text does not explicitly state that an intention-to-treat approach was used or specify how missing data was handled. More details are needed to fully judge how pragmatic the analysis was.

Reasoning: The trial used specific diagnostic criteria (Poser criteria) and only included patients suffering from a relapse of MS. This represents a more explanatory approach, as the eligibility criteria are narrower than what would be used in usual care for all MS patients.
Score: [2]

Reasoning: The trial was conducted in three neurological departments in the Netherlands. This likely represents a usual care setting for MS patients. However, with only three centers involved, the setting is somewhat more explanatory than a trial conducted across many centers that would be more representative of usual care.

Reasoning: The treatment protocol involved a specific ACTH preparation, dosing, and tapering schedule over 12 weeks, along with Vitamin B injections. This suggests a strict protocol was followed, which is a more explanatory approach compared to the flexibility likely in usual care.
Score: [2]

Flexibility (adherence):
Quotes: No relevant quotes identified. 
Reasoning: The text does not discuss any measures taken to monitor or enforce patient adherence to the intervention protocol. No information is provided on if patients were withdrawn for non-adherence. There is insufficient information to determine how pragmatic or explanatory the flexibility in adherence was.

These superior results in the ACTH group were no longer present at 6 months.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: Follow-up lasted one year, which is likely longer than usual care for an MS relapse. Assessments were done using specific scales like the Kurtzke Functional Systems and Ambulation Index. This represents a more explanatory approach with more extensive data collection than usual care.
Score: [2]

Primary outcome:

Reasoning: The primary outcomes appear to be disease stages and scores on various functional/ambulation scales. While these outcomes are relevant to MS patients, the use of specific scales and categorizations makes the assessment more explanatory than the outcomes likely used in usual care.
Score: [3]

Primary analysis:
Quotes: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Only 29 patients entered the trial. The number of patients was much smaller than was hoped for when the study was envisaged. This was due to a changing attitude towards bed rest and the introduction of short term high dose methylprednisolone treatment (9), which rapidly has gained a wide acceptance among neurologists.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: The small sample size and change in usual care during the trial suggests the primary analysis was likely per-protocol rather than intention-to-treat. However, no details are provided on whether the analysis included all randomized participants or only those who completed the protocol.

Recruitment:
Quotes: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants were recruited between April 2016 and October 2017. From a total of 148 patients invited to participate, 86 were enrolled (Figure 1) and randomly assigned to the PAE or waitlist group (Table 1).&quot;</span>
Reasoning: Recruitment was done through inviting patients from MS clinics, which is similar to how it would be done in usual care. However, the full text does not provide details on the recruitment methods (e.g. if any additional effort beyond usual care was made). Without more information, the recruitment appears to be a mix of pragmatic and explanatory.

Reasoning: The intervention group underwent supervised exercise, which differs from usual care. However, the waitlist control group continued their usual lifestyle including any ongoing physiotherapy, which is likely similar to usual care. Overall, the organization appears to be a mix of pragmatic and explanatory elements, but leans more explanatory due to the supervised exercise intervention.

There were 13 dropouts after 24 weeks (RCT dropout=15.1%), with no difference between PAE and waitlist (7 and 6 dropouts, respectively). The PAE intervention was well tolerated, with no serious adverse events.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: The intervention had a defined protocol in terms of session volume and intensity. Adherence was high with 84.8% of planned sessions completed. This suggests a more explanatory approach with limited flexibility in delivery. However, the intervention was well tolerated with no serious adverse events, supporting some pragmatism.

Follow-up:
Quotes: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Total group. For the initial exercise group, results at T48 showed that after 24 weeks of self-guided physical exercise, the improvements in cardiorespiratory fitness following PAE disappeared (−2.8 (−3.8 to −1.8) mL O2/min/kg; p < 0.01).&quot;</span>
Reasoning: Follow-up assessments were done at 48 weeks, 24 weeks after the end of the supervised intervention. This longer-term follow-up exceeds what is typically done in usual care, supporting an explanatory approach. However, after the intervention, participants self-guided their exercise, which has some pragmatic elements.

Primary outcome:
Quotes: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants underwent the BRB-N which is a cognitive performance test battery purposely developed to examine cognitive performance in specific cognitive domains in pwMS.25 In order to avoid a training effect from T0 to T24, two alternative Danish versions (A or B) of the BRB-N were administered in a randomized and stratified alternating order (i.e. A-B-A or B-A-B) under the same circumstances.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: The primary outcome was cognitive performance assessed using a MS-specific validated battery of neuropsychological tests (BRB-N). This outcome is relevant to pwMS. However, the BRB-N is a specialized battery unlikely to be routinely used in usual care, and alternate versions were used to avoid learning effects, supporting an explanatory approach.

a Men and women aged 18–65 years with relapsing forms of MS, as defined by the 2005 revised McDonald criteria [14], and an Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) Calkwood et al.

Reasoning: The eligibility criteria are fairly broad, including a wide age range of 18-65 years and EDSS scores up to 5.5, which is moderately disabled. However, the study is restricted to relapsing forms of MS and excludes patients with higher disability. This represents a compromise between the explanatory and pragmatic approaches.
Score: [3]

Recruitment:
Quotes: None relevant to recruitment methods.
Reasoning: The full text does not provide any information on the recruitment methods used in this trial, such as whether participants were recruited through usual clinic visits or if extra effort was made. There is insufficient information to assess how pragmatic or explanatory the recruitment was.
Score: [NA]

Setting:
Quotes: None relevant to setting.
Reasoning: The full text does not specify the trial setting, such as whether it was conducted in usual care settings or specialized trial centers. Without this information, the level of similarity to usual care cannot be assessed.
Score: [NA] 

Organization:
Quotes: None relevant to differences in organization between trial and usual care.
Reasoning: No details are provided in the full text on how the organization of care delivery in the trial may have differed from usual care, such as any extra staffing, training or resources. There is a lack of information to determine if the organization was pragmatic or explanatory.

Patients randomized to the iDMT group either remained on the same therapy or, following consultation with a physician, were switched immediately to another approved iDMT.' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ff9e81'>&quot;Patients randomized to the iDMT group either remained on the iDMT they were taking at randomization or were switched immediately to another approved iDMT.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: The delivery of the intervention allowed for some flexibility, as patients could either remain on their current iDMT or switch to another approved one. However, the choice of iDMTs was restricted to those that were approved, rather than any iDMT. This represents a balance between explanatory and pragmatic approaches.
Score: [3]

Flexibility (adherence):
Quotes: None relevant to flexibility in participant adherence.
Reasoning: The full text does not discuss any measures taken to monitor or enforce participant adherence to the assigned treatment, or if this was any different from usual care expectations. There is insufficient information to judge how pragmatic or explanatory the approach to adherence was.

This was measured using the Global Satisfaction subscale score on the TSQM v1.4, where higher scores indicate greater satisfaction.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: The follow-up involved completing a questionnaire at 6 months, which is only moderately more intensive than typical follow-up in usual care for MS. However, the TSQM is a specialized questionnaire not routinely used in usual care. Overall, the follow-up has both pragmatic and explanatory aspects.
Score: [3]

Reasoning: Treatment satisfaction is an outcome that is relevant to participants and reflects their direct experience. However, it is assessed using a specialized TSQM questionnaire that would not be typical in usual care. The primary outcome therefore has both pragmatic and explanatory characteristics.
Score: [3]

Primary analysis:
Quotes: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;For the primary endpoint, enrollment of 1000 patients (750 fingolimod; 250 iDMT) would provide 90% power to detect a significant difference between fingolimod and each iDMT group in the change from baseline, assuming an effect size of 0.25, a significance level of 5% and a 10% rate of unevaluable patients.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: The primary analysis planned to include all randomized patients, except for 10% considered unevaluable, which is a modified intention-to-treat approach. This is more pragmatic than a strict per-protocol or complete case analysis. However, 10% of patients being unevaluable is still a notable proportion.

You are an expert in clinical trial design and are tasked to assess the PRECIS-2 scores of a trial based on the full text of its publication. You have the following briefing:

# PRECIS-2 Domains
* Eligibility: To what extent are the participants in the trial similar to those who would receive this intervention if it was part of usual care? For example, score 5 for very pragmatic criteria essentially identical to those in usual care; score 1 for a very explanatory approach with lots of exclusions (e.g. those who don’t comply, respond to treatment, or are not at high risk for primary outcome, are children or elderly), or uses many selection tests not used in usual care.
* Recruitment: How much extra effort is made to recruit participants over and above what that would be used in the usual care setting to engage with patients? For example, score 5 for very pragmatic recruitment through usual appointments or clinic; score 1 for a very explanatory approach with targeted invitation letters, advertising in newspapers, radio plus incentives and other routes that would not be used in usual care.
* Setting: How different is the setting of the trial and the usual care setting? For example, score 5 for a very pragmatic choice using identical settings to usual care; score 1, for a very explanatory approach with only a single centre, or only specialised trial or academic centres.
* Organisation: How different are the resources, provider expertise and the organisation of care delivery in the intervention arm of the trial and those available in usual care? For example, score 5 for a very pragmatic choice that uses identical organisation to usual care; score 1 for a very explanatory approach if the trial increases staff levels, gives additional training, require more than usual experience or certification and increase resources.
* Flexibility (delivery): How different is the flexibility in how the intervention is delivered and the flexibility likely in usual care? For example, score 5 for a very pragmatic choice with identical flexibility to usual care; score 1 for a very explanatory approach if there is a strict protocol, monitoring and measures to improve compliance, with specific advice on allowed co-interventions and complications.
* Flexibility (adherence): How different is the flexibility in how participants must adhere to the intervention and the flexibility likely in usual care? For example, score 5 for a very pragmatic choice involving no more than usual encouragement to adhere to the intervention; score 1 for a very explanatory approach that involves exclusion based on adherence, and measures to improve adherence if found wanting. In some trials eg surgical trials where patients are being operated on or Intensive Care Unit trials where patients are being given IV drug therapy, this domain is not applicable as there is no compliance issue after consent has been given, so this score should be left blank.
* Follow-up: How different is the intensity of measurement and follow-up of participants in the trial and the likely follow-up in usual care? For example, score 5 for a very pragmatic approach with no more than usual follow up; score 1 for a very explanatory approach with more frequent, longer visits, unscheduled visits triggered by primary outcome event or intervening event, and more extensive data collection.
* Primary outcome: To what extent is the trial's primary outcome relevant to participants? For example, score 5 for a very pragmatic choice where the outcome is of obvious importance to participants; score 1 for a very explanatory approach using a surrogate, physiological outcome, central adjudication or use assessment expertise that is not available in usual care, or the outcome is measured at an earlier time than in usual care.
* Primary analysis: To what extent are all data included in the analysis of the primary outcome? For example, score 5 for a very pragmatic approach using intention to treat with all available data; score 1 for a very explanatory analysis that excludes ineligible post-randomisation participants, includes only completers or those following the treatment protocol.

For each of the 9 domains of PRECIS-2, perform the following steps:
1. Extract 1-3 relevant quotes from the full text.
2. Explain your reasoning in 1 paragraph.
3. Give a score X from 1 (very explanatory) to 5 (very pragmatic) in square brackets like this: "Score: [X]". If the full text does not contain enough information to assess a specific domain, report "Score: [NA]".

Do not provide a final summary paragraph in the end.
