</th>
<th style="text-align:left;">
<span style="border-bottom: 1px dashed black"
title="A1. Was an &#39;a priori&#39; design provided? The research question and inclusion criteria should be established before the conduct of the review. Note: Need to refer to a protocol, ethics approval, or pre-determined/a priori published research objectives to score a “yes.”">
A1</span>
</th>
<th style="text-align:left;">
<span style="border-bottom: 1px dashed black"
title="A2. Was there duplicate study selection and data extraction? There should be at least two independent data extractors and a consensus procedure for disagreements should be in place. Note: 2 people do study selection, 2 people do data extraction, consensus process or one person checks the other’s work.">
A2</span>
</th>
<th style="text-align:left;">
<span style="border-bottom: 1px dashed black"
title="A3. Was a comprehensive literature search performed? At least two electronic sources should be searched. The report must include years and databases used (e.g., Central, EMBASE, and MEDLINE). Key words and/or MESH terms must be stated and where feasible the search strategy should be provided. All searches should be supplemented by consulting current contents, reviews, textbooks, specialized registers, or experts in the particular field of study, and by reviewing the references in the studies found. Note: If at least 2 sources + one supplementary strategy used, select “yes” (Cochrane register/Central counts as 2 sources; a grey literature search counts as supplementary).">
A3</span>
</th>
<th style="text-align:left;">
<span style="border-bottom: 1px dashed black"
title="A4. Was the status of publication (i.e. grey literature) used as an inclusion criterion? The authors should state that they searched for reports regardless of their publication type. The authors should state whether or not they excluded any reports (from the systematic review), based on their publication status, language etc. Note: If review indicates that there was a search for “grey literature” or “unpublished literature,” indicate “yes.” SIGLE database, dissertations, conference proceedings, and trial registries are all considered grey for this purpose. If searching a source that contains both grey and non-grey, must specify that they were searching for grey/unpublished lit.">
A4</span>
</th>
<th style="text-align:left;">
<span style="border-bottom: 1px dashed black"
title="A5. Was a list of studies (included and excluded) provided? A list of included and excluded studies should be provided. Note: Acceptable if the excluded studies are referenced. If there is an electronic link to the list but the link is dead, select “no.”">
A5</span>
</th>
<th style="text-align:left;">
<span style="border-bottom: 1px dashed black"
title="A6. Were the characteristics of the included studies provided? In an aggregated form such as a table, data from the original studies should be provided on the participants, interventions and outcomes. The ranges of characteristics in all the studies analyzed e.g., age, race, sex, relevant socioeconomic data, disease status, duration, severity, or other diseases should be reported. Note: Acceptable if not in table format as long as they are described as above. Paul &quot;Follow-up poorly reported in general&quot;">
A6</span>
</th>
<th style="text-align:left;">
<span style="border-bottom: 1px dashed black"
title="A7. Was the scientific quality of the included studies assessed and documented? &#39;A priori&#39; methods of assessment should be provided (e.g., for effectiveness studies if the author(s) chose to include only randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled studies, or allocation concealment as inclusion criteria); for other types of studies alternative items will be relevant. Note: Can include use of a quality scoring tool or checklist, e.g., Jadad scale, risk of bias, sensitivity analysis, etc., or a description of quality items, with some kind of result for EACH study (“low” or “high” is fine, as long as it is clear which studies scored “low” and which scored “high”; a summary score/range for all studies is not acceptable).">
A7</span>
</th>
<th style="text-align:left;">
<span style="border-bottom: 1px dashed black"
title="A8. Was the scientific quality of the included studies used appropriately in formulating conclusions? The results of the methodological rigor and scientific quality should be considered in the analysis and the conclusions of the review, and explicitly stated in formulating recommendations. Note: Might say something such as “the results should be interpreted with caution due to poor quality of included studies.” Cannot score “yes” for this question if scored “no” for question A7.">
A8</span>
</th>
<th style="text-align:left;">
<span style="border-bottom: 1px dashed black"
title="A9. Were the methods used to combine the findings of studies appropriate? For the pooled results, a test should be done to ensure the studies were combinable, to assess their homogeneity (i.e., Chi-squared test for homogeneity, I2 ). If heterogeneity exists a random effects model should be used and/or the clinical appropriateness of combining should be taken into consideration (i.e., is it sensible to combine?). Note: Indicate “yes” if they mention or describe heterogeneity, i.e., if they explain that they cannot pool because of heterogeneity/variability between interventions.">
A9</span>
</th>
<th style="text-align:left;">
<span style="border-bottom: 1px dashed black"
title="A10. Was the likelihood of publication bias assessed? An assessment of publication bias should include a combination of graphical aids (e.g., funnel plot, other available tests) and/or statistical tests (e.g., Egger regression test, Hedges-Olken). Note: If no test values or funnel plot included, score “no”. Score “yes” if mentions that publication bias could not be assessed because there were fewer than 10 included studies.">
A10</span>
</th>
<th style="text-align:left;">
<span style="border-bottom: 1px dashed black"
title="A11. Was the conflict of interest included? Potential sources of support should be clearly acknowledged in both the systematic review and the included studies. Note: To get a “yes,” must indicate source of funding or support for the systematic review AND for each of the included studies.">

A3. <span style='background-color: #ffe9e2' title='Added squared brackets during extraction'>[Yes]</span> - <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎The search strategy yielded 3724 citations of which 273 articles were identified as potentially relevant.&quot;</span> Search methods, databases, and date ranges are provided. 

A4. <span style='background-color: #ffe9e2' title='Added squared brackets during extraction'>[Yes]</span> - <span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎The authors should state that they searched for reports regardless of their publication type.&quot;</span> The review searched for abstracts in English but full text could be in Danish, English, French or Norwegian. This indicates no exclusion based on publication status.

A5. <span style='background-color: #ffe9e2' title='Added squared brackets during extraction'>[No]</span> - A flow diagram of included/excluded studies is provided but no list of excluded studies. 

A6. <span style='background-color: #ffe9e2' title='Added squared brackets during extraction'>[Yes]</span> - <span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎In an aggregated form such as a table, data from the original studies should be provided on the participants, interventions and outcomes.&quot;</span> Results tables include sample size, age, BMI, follow-up period, etc.

Here are the relevant quotes, reasoning, and responses for each AMSTAR question:

A1. Was an 'a priori' design provided?

Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of the existing evidence.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The review protocol was not pre-registered.

[No]

A2. Was there duplicate study selection and data extraction? 

Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎Retrieved articles were assessed for eligibility and data on patients, intervention, control, outcomes and methodological quality were abstracted independently by two authors.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: Two authors independently performed study selection and data extraction. 

[Yes]

A3. Was a comprehensive literature search performed?

Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎All potential publications from Medline (1950–June 2010), Embase (1980–June 2010), The Cochrane Library (issue 2, 2010) and ongoing trials through http://www.clinicaltrials.gov website were identified.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: Searched at least two databases plus other sources.

[Yes]  

A4. Was the status of publication used as an inclusion criterion?

No mention of including or excluding studies based on publication status.

[No]

A5. Was a list of studies (included and excluded) provided?

Included studies listed in Table 1. Excluded studies not listed.

[No]

A6. Were the characteristics of the included studies provided? 

Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎Data on patients, intervention, control, outcomes and methodological quality were abstracted independently by two authors.&quot;</span> 

And study characteristics described in text.

Reasoning: Characteristics of included studies provided.

[Yes]

A7. Was the scientific quality of the included studies assessed and documented?

Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎The quality of the included comparative studies was assessed independently by two authors.&quot;</span> And quality assessment described for each study.

Reasoning: Quality assessment performed and documented.

[Yes]

A8. Was the scientific quality of the included studies used appropriately in formulating conclusions?

No explicit statement about incorporating study quality in conclusions.

[No]

A9. Were the methods used to combine the findings of studies appropriate?

Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎For dichotomous outcomes, odds ratio (OR) and its associated confidence interval were calculated. For continuous outcomes, treatment effect was expressed as mean difference and its calculated standard deviation. If appropriate, meta-analysis of pooled data of the comparative studies was performed using a fixed effect model.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: Appropriate methods used for meta-analysis. Heterogeneity assessed. 

[Yes]

A10. Was the likelihood of publication bias assessed?

No assessment of publication bias.

[No]

A11. Was the conflict of interest included?

A1. [Yes] <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎We used the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis (PRISMA) statement to report our findings.&quot;</span> They mentioned using PRISMA guidelines which require an a priori protocol.

A2. [Yes] <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎Two authors (Hsu and Chang) of the current study independently searched and reviewed the articles.&quot;</span> Two authors independently selected studies. 

A3. [Yes] <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎We searched PubMed® for comparative studies (from January 1990 to 2014 September) that compared the efficacy and safety of robotic versus open pyeloplasty. Searches were limited to studies published in English. We used the following keywords: robotic, pyeloplasty, ureteropelvic junction obstruction, children, and pediatric.&quot;</span> They searched PubMed and provided search terms.

A4. [No] No mention of searching for or including grey literature.

A5. [Yes] Figure 1 provides a flow chart showing included and excluded studies.

A6. [Yes] Table 1 provides characteristics of included studies. 

A7. [No] They did not assess quality of individual studies.

A8. [NA] No quality assessment done, so using it in formulating conclusions not applicable.

A9. [Yes] <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎The meta-analysis was performed using the fixed effect method when there was no statistically significant heterogeneity. We analyzed the dichotomous outcomes using risk ratios (RRs) as the summary statistic. Chi-square statistical tests (Q statistics) and the I2 test were used to test the heterogeneity between the trials.&quot;</span> They assessed heterogeneity and used appropriate methods.

A10. [No] No assessment of publication bias mentioned. 

A11. [No] No mention of conflicts of interest or funding sources for included studies.

Here are my AMSTAR quality assessment responses for the given systematic review:

A1. Was an 'a priori' design provided? 
<span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎The research question and inclusion criteria should be established before the conduct of the review.&quot;</span>
[No] The review does not mention an a priori design or protocol.

A2. Was there duplicate study selection and data extraction?
<span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎There should be at least two independent data extractors and a consensus procedure for disagreements should be in place.&quot;</span>  
<span title='Moderate quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 91%):

Literature reviews, individual case reports, exclusively adult studies (age >20 years), and small case series of fewer than three paediatric patients were excluded. Paediatric data from combined adult and paediatric studies were included only if it was possible to select out the paediatric data. The inclusion of publications was decided by both the study authors and data were extracted independently by both study authors' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ff9e81'>&quot;‎Literature reviews, case reports, series of <3 children and adult studies (age >20 years) were excluded. The inclusion of publications was decided by both the study authors and data were extracted independently by both study authors.&quot;</span>
[Yes] The review states that two authors performed study selection and data extraction.

Here are the AMSTAR assessments based on the provided full text:

A1. Was an 'a priori' design provided? 
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎Despite the publication of a number of observational studies examining bariatric surgery in young people under 18 years (Black 2013), only one RCT was identified (O'Brien 2010).&quot;</span> [No] 
The review did not mention a protocol, ethics approval, or pre-determined objectives.

A2. Was there duplicate study selection and data extraction?
[NA] Not mentioned in the text.

A3. Was a comprehensive literature search performed?  
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎We searched the following sources on the 30th of March 2015 from inception to the specified database date and placed no restrictions on the language of publication.&quot;</span> [Yes]
The review searched multiple databases and other sources without language restrictions. 

A4. Was the status of publication used as an inclusion criterion?
[NA] Publication status was not mentioned as an inclusion criterion.

A5. Was a list of studies (included and excluded) provided?
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎Six studies had to be excluded after careful evaluation of the full publication (Aikenhead 2011; Black 2013; Farina 2012; Gloy 2013; Picot 2009; Tyvonchuk 2009; see Figure 1).&quot;</span> [Yes] 
The review provided a list of included and excluded studies.

A6. Were the characteristics of the included studies provided?
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎A detailed description of the characteristics of included studies is presented elsewhere (see Characteristics of included studies and appendices).&quot;</span> [Yes]
The review provided details on the characteristics of the included study.

A7. Was the scientific quality of the included studies assessed and documented?
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎Whilst the included study was well conducted and provides much needed evidence in this field, further studies are required to strengthen the evidence base.&quot;</span> [Yes]
The review assessed risk of bias in the included study. 

A8. Was the scientific quality of the included studies used appropriately in formulating conclusions? 
[NA] Only one study was included, so this question is not applicable.

A9. Were the methods used to combine the findings of studies appropriate?
[NA] No meta-analysis was performed since only one study was included.

A10. Was the likelihood of publication bias assessed?
[NA] Assessment of publication bias is not applicable with only one included study.

A11. Was the conflict of interest included?
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎The authors state their uncertainty as to whether the study population is an accurate reflection of the general obese adolescent population, since it may have attracted a subset of the community amenable to the availability of free treatment.&quot;</span> [No]
No statement about conflicts of interest for the included study or the review itself.

Here are the relevant quotes, reasoning, and responses for each AMSTAR question:

A1. Was an 'a priori' design provided? 

Relevant quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎We evaluated whether single stage or 2-stage FSO results in greater testicular viability in children younger than 18 years with intra-abdominal testes.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The research question and inclusion criteria were established before conducting the review.

Response: [Yes]

A2. Was there duplicate study selection and data extraction?

Relevant quotes: 
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎Each author was allocated roughly 10 articles, and independently abstracted the data and assessed the quality of the reports.&quot;</span>
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎Each article was evaluated by 2 of us independently and any disagreement was resolved by consensus with the help of a third reviewer.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: Two reviewers independently performed study selection and data extraction, with a third reviewer resolving disagreements. 

Response: [Yes]

A3. Was a comprehensive literature search performed?

Relevant quotes:  
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎We searched several electronic databases, including MEDLINE®, EMBASE®, CINAHL®, Cochrane Central Register of Control Trials, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects and ACP Journal Club®.&quot;</span>
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎Reference lists of the selected articles were hand searched for relevant citations, as was potentially relevant gray literature.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: Searched multiple databases, supplemented with other sources.

Response: [Yes] 

A4. Was the status of publication used as an inclusion criterion?

Relevant quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎This search was restricted to articles published in English and was dated to February 2009.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: Did not search for unpublished studies or state whether publication status was an inclusion criterion.  

Response: [No]

A5. Was a list of studies (included and excluded) provided?

Relevant quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎A total of 1,807 potentially relevant articles were retrieved from the initial electronic database search and an additional 13 studies from the gray literature search. After a thorough assessment 99 articles underwent a full review for evaluation of quality and data abstraction by the entire team. Ultimately 61 articles were included in the review (fig. 1).&quot;</span>

Reasoning: Provided details on included and excluded studies.

Response: [Yes]

A6. Were the characteristics of the included studies provided?

Relevant quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎The table summarizes the quality assessment results of the included articles.&quot;</span> 

Reasoning: Provided a table with characteristics of included studies.

Response: [Yes]

A7. Was the scientific quality of the included studies assessed and documented?

Relevant quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎Noncomparative case series were evaluated using a quality assessment instrument developed for this study.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: Assessed quality of included studies using a quality assessment tool. 

Response: [Yes]

A8. Was the scientific quality of the included studies used appropriately in formulating conclusions?

Relevant quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎The strength of this study was limited by several factors. This systematic review failed to identify any RCTs comparing success rates of single vs 2-stage FSO.&quot;</span> 

Reasoning: Limited quality of studies acknowledged in limitations and conclusions.

Response: [Yes]

A9. Were the methods used to combine the findings of studies appropriate?

Relevant quotes:  
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎Heterogeneity was assessed graphically by examining the forest plot and statistically using the I2 test.&quot;</span>
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎Meta-analysis using weighted mean difference (random effects model) was conducted using R software.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: Assessed heterogeneity statistically and used random effects model for meta-analysis.

Response: [Yes]

A10. Was the likelihood of publication bias assessed? 

Relevant quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎The funnel plot was roughly symmetrical, suggesting that publication bias was unlikely a significant factor (fig. 5).&quot;</span>

Reasoning: Assessed publication bias using a funnel plot.

Response: [Yes]

A11. Was the conflict of interest included?

Relevant quote: No mention of conflicts of interest or study funding.

Reasoning: Did not report on conflicts of interest or study funding.

Response: [No]

Here are my responses to the 11 AMSTAR questions for the given systematic review:

A1: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎Literature searches were conducted to identify studies having compared the laparoscopic splenectomy (LS) and open splenectomy (OS) for children.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: The research question and inclusion criteria were established before conducting the review.
[Yes]

A2: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎Included studies were independently reviewed by two reviewers, and a third reviewer was required for a final decision in the case of any discrepancies.&quot;</span>  
Reasoning: There were at least two independent data extractors.
[Yes]

A3: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎Published records were searched using the MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Web of Science from 1993 to 2015.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: At least two electronic sources were searched.
[Yes]  

A4: No relevant quotes.
Reasoning: The status of publication was not mentioned as an inclusion criteria.  
[No]

A5: No relevant quotes. 
Reasoning: A list of included and excluded studies was not provided.
[No]

A6: <span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎In an aggregated form such as a table, data from the original studies should be provided on the participants, interventions and outcomes.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: Characteristics of included studies were provided in Tables 1-3.
[Yes]

A7: No relevant quotes.
Reasoning: The quality of included studies was not assessed.
[No] 

A8: No relevant quotes.
Reasoning: Study quality was not used in formulating conclusions since it was not assessed.
[NA]

A9: No relevant quotes.  
Reasoning: This is not a meta-analysis so combining of findings is not applicable.
[NA]

A10: No relevant quotes.
Reasoning: Publication bias was not assessed.
[No]

A11: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎Acknowledgments: The manuscript had been proofread by Professor Xin-He Lai, Institute of Translational Medicine, the First Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou, China.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: Source of support was stated for the systematic review but not the included studies.
[No]

An assessment of publication bias should include a combination of graphical aids (e.g., funnel plot, other available tests) and/or statistical tests (e.g., Egger regression test, Hedges-Olken). Note: If no test values or funnel plot included, score “no”. Score “yes” if mentions that publication bias could not be assessed because there were fewer than 10 included studies.">

Here are my responses to the 11 AMSTAR questions based on the provided systematic review text:

A1. <span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎The research question and inclusion criteria should be established before the conduct of the review.&quot;</span>

Relevant quotes: 
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎This review was conducted in accordance with the systematic review guidelines provided by the Cochrane Collaboration and Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) checklist.&quot;</span>
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎To be included in this systematic review studies were required to have reported on at least 50 cases of paediatric patients (aged ≤18 years) who underwent URS for stone disease, and their outcomes.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The review mentions following systematic review guidelines and provides pre-determined inclusion criteria. 

Response: [Yes]

A2. <span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎There should be at least two independent data extractors and a consensus procedure for disagreements should be in place.&quot;</span>

Relevant quote:

Reasoning: Two independent reviewers performed data extraction.

Response: [Yes]

A3. <span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎At least two electronic sources should be searched. The report must include years and databases used (e.g., Central, EMBASE, and MEDLINE). Key words and/or MESH terms must be stated and where feasible the search strategy should be provided.&quot;</span> 

Relevant quotes:
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎The search involved finding relevant studies from MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, CINAHL, Google Scholar and individual urological journals, published between January 1990 and May 2013.&quot;</span>

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎The terms used in the search included the following: ‘ureteroscopy’, ‘paediatric’, ‘pediatric’, ‘paediatrics’, ‘pediatrics’, ‘children’, ‘calculi’, ‘stones’, ‘laser’, ‘laser therapy’ and ‘urolithiasis’.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: Multiple electronic databases searched with date ranges and search terms provided.

Response: [Yes]

A4. <span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎The authors should state that they searched for reports regardless of their publication type.

Relevant quote: 
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎Only papers written in the English language were considered for inclusion.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: They explicitly state only including English language papers. No mention of excluding based on publication status.

Response: [No] 

A5. <span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎A list of included and excluded studies should be provided.&quot;</span> 

Relevant quote: None found.

Reasoning: No explicit list of included/excluded studies provided.

Response: [No]

A6. <span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎In an aggregated form such as a table, data from the original studies should be provided on the participants, interventions and outcomes.&quot;</span>

Relevant quotes: 
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎The mean (range) age of the reported populations was 7.8 (0.25–18.0) years and the populations included 768 boys and 727 girls.&quot;</span>

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎Stone location was recorded in all studies, with the majority of stones lying in the ureter (n = 1427, 83.4%) and most commonly within the distal ureter (n = 862, 50.4%).&quot;</span> 

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎The mean (range) stone burden was 9.8 (1–30) mm with a mean (range) SFR of 87.5 (58–100)% after initial therapeutic URS.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: Participant demographics, stone locations, stone burden, and SFR reported in aggregated form.

Response: [Yes]

A7. <span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎'A priori' methods of assessment should be provided (e.g., for effectiveness studies if the author(s) chose to include only randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled studies, or allocation concealment as inclusion criteria); for other types of studies alternative items will be relevant.&quot;</span>

Relevant quote: None found.

Reasoning: No mention of quality assessment methods.

Response: [No]

There were two independent reviewers for study selection. 

A3. Was a comprehensive literature search performed?
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎The search terms used were “gastroschisis” and [(“treatment outcome” or “prognosis”) or randomized controlled trials].&quot;</span> [No]
Only two databases were searched so the literature search was not comprehensive.

A4. Was the status of publication used as an inclusion criterion? 
No mention of including or excluding based on publication status. [NA]

Table 1 provides relevant characteristics of included studies.

A7. Was the scientific quality of the included studies assessed and documented?
No mention of quality assessment for included studies. [No] 
No quality assessment is described.

A8. Was the scientific quality of the included studies used appropriately in formulating conclusions? [NA]
See A7.

A9. Were the methods used to combine the findings of studies appropriate?
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎For each study, treatment effects were calculated using a fixed effect model to obtain weighted mean difference and 95% confidence interval for continuous outcomes, and odds ratio and 95% confidence interval for dichotomous outcomes.&quot;</span> [Yes]
Appropriate quantitative synthesis methods are described. 

A10. Was the likelihood of publication bias assessed?
No mention of assessing publication bias. [No]
Publication bias not assessed.

Here are the AMSTAR assessments for the given systematic review:

A1. Was an 'a priori' design provided? 
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎We have therefore asked whether MIS approaches to neonatal CDH repair are associated with changes in survival, CDH recurrence risk, operative time, and/or prosthetic patch usage.&quot;</span> [Yes]
The review states the objectives and research questions.

A2. Was there duplicate study selection and data extraction?
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎Two independent reviewers reviewed all studies in abstract form.&quot;</span> [Yes] 
Two independent reviewers performed study selection.

A3. Was a comprehensive literature search performed?
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎MEDLINE (1950 to present), Embase (1980 to present) and Cochrane Controlled Trials Register databases were searched using the keywords ‘diaphragmatic hernia AND thoracoscopic,’ ‘diaphragmatic hernia AND laparoscopic,’ and ‘diaphragmatic hernia AND minimally-invasive.’ Relevant conference proceedings were also searched for abstracts of appropriate studies.&quot;</span> [Yes]
Multiple databases and conference proceedings were searched. 

A4. Was the status of publication used as an inclusion criterion?  
No mention of including or excluding based on publication status. [NA]
The review does not mention searching for or using unpublished literature.

A5. Was a list of studies (included and excluded) provided?
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎The electronic search identified a total of 292 studies. Exclusions were made as detailed in the flow chart (Fig. 2).&quot;</span> [Yes]
A flow chart of included and excluded studies is provided.

A6. Were the characteristics of the included studies provided?
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎Analyzing the demographic data in each study, there were no statistically significant differences in proportion of male sex, mean birth weight, proportion of left sided CDH, or proportion of cases with significant associated anomalies between open and endosurgical groups.&quot;</span> [Yes]
Relevant characteristics of included studies are described. 

A7. Was the scientific quality of the included studies assessed and documented?
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎No randomized controlled trials were found. The 3 included studies compare series of neonatal thoracoscopic and open CDH repairs performed at the same institutions.39,41,43 All are limited by their methodology, primarily due to the control (open surgery) groups being historical; there is therefore significant risk of case selection and performance bias.&quot;</span> [Yes]
The limitations and risk of bias of included studies are discussed.

A8. Was the scientific quality of the included studies used appropriately in formulating conclusions?  
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎However, these findings need to be considered in the context of the methodological limitations of the studies available for inclusion; for each outcome measure, we will discuss the potential for bias and other confounding factors.&quot;</span> [Yes]
The limitations of the studies are considered when interpreting the results.

A9. Were the methods used to combine the findings of studies appropriate?
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎Data meta-analysis was carried out using Review Manager (RevMan) Version 5.0 (The Nordic Cochrane Centre, The Cochrane Collaboration, 2008). Weighted treatment effect was calculated using the fixed effects model. Treatment effect sizes were calculated and presented as relative risk (RR) for dichotomous variables and weighted mean difference (WMD) for continuous variables; along with 95% confidence intervals in each case. Statistical heterogeneity was assessed using a χ2 test and the I2 statistic used to assess the impact of heterogeneity on the meta-analysis.&quot;</span> [Yes]
Appropriate meta-analysis methods are described.

A10. Was the likelihood of publication bias assessed?
No assessment of publication bias mentioned. [No]
Publication bias is not assessed.

A11. Was the conflict of interest included?
No mention of conflicts of interest. [No]
Conflicts of interest are not reported.

Here are my responses to the 11 AMSTAR questions based on the provided full text:

A1. [Yes] <span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎The research question and inclusion criteria should be established before the conduct of the review.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: The authors state that they used predefined inclusion criteria. 

A2. [Yes] <span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎There should be at least two independent data extractors and a consensus procedure for disagreements should be in place.&quot;</span>  
Reasoning: The authors state <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎The following data were extracted separately by the same two authors for all studies meeting the inclusion criteria.&quot;</span>

A3. [Yes] <span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎At least two electronic sources should be searched.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: The authors searched PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library.

A4. [Yes] <span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎The authors should state that they searched for reports regardless of their publication type.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: The authors state <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎Language restrictions and time horizons were not applied.&quot;</span>

A5. [No] <span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎A list of included and excluded studies should be provided.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: The authors do not provide a list of included and excluded studies.

A6. [Yes] <span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎In an aggregated form such as a table, data from the original studies should be provided on the participants, interventions and outcomes.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: Table 1 provides aggregated data on the included studies. 

A7. [No] <span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎A priori' methods of assessment should be provided (e.g., for effectiveness studies if the author(s) chose to include only randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled studies, or allocation concealment as inclusion criteria).&quot;</span>
Reasoning: The authors do not report using a priori quality assessment methods.

A8. [No] <span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎The results of the methodological rigor and scientific quality should be considered in the analysis and the conclusions of the review.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: The quality of included studies is not discussed in the conclusions.

A9. [Yes] <span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎For the pooled results, a test should be done to ensure the studies were combinable, to assess their homogeneity (i.e., Chi-squared test for homogeneity, I2).&quot;</span>
Reasoning: The authors assessed heterogeneity using I2 and Chi2 tests.

A10. [No] <span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎An assessment of publication bias should include a combination of graphical aids (e.g., funnel plot, other available tests) and/or statistical tests (e.g., Egger regression test, Hedges-Olken).&quot;</span> 
Reasoning: The authors only used funnel plots to assess publication bias.

A11. [No] <span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎Potential sources of support should be clearly acknowledged in both the systematic review and the included studies.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: Sources of support are only reported for the systematic review itself.

Here are the relevant quotes and brief explanations for the 11 AMSTAR criteria applied to the given systematic review text:

A1. Was an 'a priori' design provided? 
>The searches were performed independently for each question with the aid of a health sciences librarian who used broad Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) search terms that were inclusive and redundant, and included wildcard based searches to ensure completeness. [Yes] - Search strategy designed a priori using MeSH terms.

A2. Was there duplicate study selection and data extraction?
>Using bibliography management software, duplicates were removed, creating a master list of titles and abstracts. Two of the principal authors (P.P. and S.I.) independently scanned all titles as a first screen after which selected abstracts and/or full-length papers were collected for further review. [Yes] - Duplicate study selection done.

A3. Was a comprehensive literature search performed?
>Separate search terms were applied for each question using the MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane, and Web of Science databases. Searches were limited to articles published in the English language from January 1, 1980 through January 31, 2014. [Yes] - Multiple databases searched, with supplemental manual search of references. 

A4. Was the status of publication used as an inclusion criterion?
>Animal studies, case reports, non-English language publications, and review articles were excluded in addition to the articles that dealt with non-neonatal diaphragmatic conditions. [Yes] - Excluded non-English and other unpublished literature.

A5. Was a list of studies (included and excluded) provided? 
>A CONSORT diagram indicating inclusion and exclusion of articles used for systematic review. [Yes] - Inclusion/exclusion flow diagram provided.

A6. Were the characteristics of the included studies provided?
>Data compiled for each article included sample size, description of the procedures performed or medications used, method of ventilation, use of ECMO, timing of repair, outcomes including mortality and morbidity, and type of patch used. [Yes] - Relevant characteristics described for included studies. 

A7. Was the scientific quality of the included studies assessed and documented?
>[No] - No quality assessment described for included studies.

A8. Was the scientific quality of the included studies used appropriately in formulating conclusions? [NA]

A9. Were the methods used to combine the findings of studies appropriate? [NA] 

A10. Was the likelihood of publication bias assessed? [NA]

A11. Was the conflict of interest included? 
>Potential sources of support should be clearly acknowledged in both the systematic review and the included studies. [No] - No statement on conflicts of interest.

A2. [No] The review does not mention whether there were at least two independent data extractors. 

A3. [Yes] <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎We searched Medline, Embase and the Cochrane controlled trials register from inception to July 2014 using the terms ‘gastroschisis’, ‘gastroschisis and silo’, ‘preformed silo’ and ‘silastic silo’.&quot;</span> At least two databases were searched.

A4. [No] The review does not mention whether grey literature was searched or used as an inclusion criterion.

A5. [Yes] <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎The remaining 18 publications were included in this systematic review. Characteristics of included studies are shown in Table 1.&quot;</span> A list of included studies is provided. 

A6.

A7. [No] The review does not mention a quality assessment of the included studies.

A8. [NA] A quality assessment of included studies was not performed, so A8 is not applicable.

A9.

Here are my AMSTAR ratings for the systematic review:

A1. Was an 'a priori' design provided? 
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎[We performed a systematic review from the published literature. The Ovid (Ovid Technologies New York, NY) and Medline search engines were used to examine both the Pubmed and Cochrane libraries from January 2000 to December 2008.

Here are my responses to the 11 AMSTAR questions for the provided systematic review text:

A1. Was an 'a priori' design provided? 
-<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎A study protocol outlining the search strategy, outcomes, and methods of data extraction and statistical analysis was designed and prospectively registered with the Prospero database (CRD42013005698).&quot;</span>
[Yes] The authors registered a protocol.

A2. Was there duplicate study selection and data extraction?  
-<span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 97.9%):

Titles and abstracts of potentially relevant papers were screened by two independent authors (DT and BA). The full texts of all identified studies were assessed against the criteria in table 1 by the two independent authors (DT and BA), and study reference lists were hand searched for potentially relevant studies. Any discrepancies were resolved by consensus discussion with a third author (MK).
Data extraction

Data were extracted by the two independent authors (DT and BA) using a predesigned proforma' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;‎Titles and abstracts of potentially relevant papers were screened by two independent authors (DT and BA)...the full texts of all identified studies were assessed against the criteria in table 1 by the two independent authors (DT and BA)"..."Data were extracted by the two independent authors (DT and BA) using a predesigned proforma.&quot;</span>  
[Yes] Two independent authors performed study selection and data extraction.

A3. Was a comprehensive literature search performed?
-<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎We searched all publications from 1 January 1998 to 1 January 2014 from EMBASE, MEDLINE and Cochrane library databases using the search strategy detailed in online supplementary appendix I.&quot;</span>
[Yes] Multiple databases were searched with supplemental strategy. 

A4. Was the status of publication used as an inclusion criterion?

[Yes] Included and excluded studies shown in flow chart.

A6. Were the characteristics of the included studies provided?
- Table 2 provides characteristics of the included studies.
[Yes] Characteristics provided in table.

A7. Was the scientific quality of the included studies assessed and documented?
-<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎Study quality was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale for cohort studies.&quot;</span> 
[Yes] Quality assessed using a scale.

A8. Was the scientific quality of the included studies used appropriately in formulating conclusions? 
No mention of incorporating study quality in conclusions.
[No] Study quality not incorporated in conclusions.

A9. Were the methods used to combine the findings of studies appropriate?
- <span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 98%):

Continuous data were analysed using an inverse variance model to produce a mean difference. Dichotomous variables were analysed using a Mantel-Haenszel model to produce ORs. χ2 Test for heterogeneity was used to assess agreement within studies. Random-effects models were used when there was significant variation in outcome assessment measures between studies or when there was evidence of significant heterogeneity; otherwise, fixed-effects models were use' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;‎Continuous data were analysed using an inverse variance model...

Here are my responses for the 11 AMSTAR questions:

A1. Was an 'a priori' design provided?

Relevant quotes: 
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎This systematic review focused on randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and controlled clinical trials (CCTs).&quot;</span>
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or controlled clinical trials (CCTs) comparing minimally invasive surgery (MIS) and open surgery for the treatment of intra-thoracic or intra-abdominal solid neoplasms were considered for inclusion.&quot;</span>

The review had predefined inclusion criteria for study designs. [Yes]

A2. Was there duplicate study selection and data extraction?  

Relevant quote:
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎No eligible studies were identified, data extraction by two independent authors using a standardised form could not be performed.&quot;</span>

No eligible studies were found, so duplicate processes could not occur. [NA]

A3. Was a comprehensive literature search performed?

Relevant quotes:  
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎We searched the following electronic databases: CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library 2014, Issue 1), MEDLINE/PubMed (from 1966 to 18 February 2014) and EMBASE/Ovid (from 1980 to 18 February 2014).&quot;</span>
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎We searched the reference lists of relevant articles and reviews to identify additional studies.&quot;</span>

Multiple databases were searched with supplemental hand searching. [Yes]

A4. Was the status of publication used as an inclusion criterion?

Relevant quote: 
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎We imposed no language restriction.&quot;</span>

All publications were eligible regardless of language or publication status. [Yes]  

A5. Was a list of studies (included and excluded) provided?

Relevant quote:
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎However, these studies were not randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or controlled clinical trials (CCTs) evaluating MIS in children with solid intra-thoracic or intra-abdominal neoplasms and were thus not eligible for inclusion in this review (See Figure 1 and the Characteristics of excluded studies table).&quot;</span>

A list of excluded studies with reasons was provided. [Yes]

A6. Were the characteristics of the included studies provided?

Relevant quote: 
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎No eligible studies were identified, data extraction by two independent authors using a standardised form could not be performed.&quot;</span>

No studies met the inclusion criteria, so characteristics were not provided. [NA]

A7. Was the scientific quality of the included studies assessed?

Relevant quote:  
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎Since no eligible studies were identified, the assessment of the risk of bias in included studies was not applicable.&quot;</span>

No included studies, so quality assessment not done. [NA]

A8. Was the scientific quality of the included studies used appropriately in formulating conclusions? 

Relevant quote:
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎Since no eligible studies were identified, the effects of MIS versus open surgery for the treatment of solid intra-thoracic or intra-abdominal neoplasms in children remain unclear.&quot;</span>

No included studies, so quality not incorporated into conclusions. [NA]

A9. Were the methods used to combine the findings of studies appropriate?

Relevant quote: 
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎No eligible studies were identified. As a result, data analyses could not be performed.&quot;</span>

No meta-analysis done since no studies included. [NA]

A10. Was the likelihood of publication bias assessed?

No assessment of publication bias mentioned. [No]

A11. Was the conflict of interest stated?

Relevant quote:
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎Authors' declarations of interest&quot;</span>

Conflicts of interest were declared. [Yes]

[Yes] <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎The 2 reviewers, R.N.W.V. and E.N.B. independently reviewed all study abstracts in duplicate with disagreements resolved by the senior author (J.C.R.). Full-text articles appearing to meet selection criteria were reviewed, and study data was abstracted in the same manner.&quot;</span>

A3. <span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in prompt (Similarity 99.3%):

[No] The excluded studies are not listed.

A6. <span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎Acceptable if not in table format as long as they are described as above.&quot;</span>
[Yes] <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎In total, 4,022 patients were included. Of these, 1,632 children (41%) were male patients. Reported ages ranged from<1 month to 18 years. Bilateral tumors were present in 1,153 (29%) patients, including at least 4 metachronous contralateral tumors. The reported mean size of excised tumors ranged from 5 to 14 cm for RN and 1.5 to 9 cm for NSS.&quot;</span>

A7. <span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎Can include use of a quality scoring tool or checklist, e.g., Jadad scale, risk of bias, sensitivity analysis, etc., or a description of quality items, with some kind of result for EACH study (“low” or “high” is fine, as long as it is clear which studies scored “low” and which scored “high”; a summary score/range for all studies is not acceptable).&quot;</span> 
[No] The authors do not assess the quality of included studies.

Here are my responses to the 11 AMSTAR questions:

A1. Was an 'a priori' design provided? 

>[Patients and Methods, Systematic Review, Search Strategy] A systematic literature search was conducted in the PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science databases with the help of an experienced librarian.

The search strategy was defined prior to conducting the review. [Yes]

A2. Was there duplicate study selection and data extraction?

>[Patients and Methods, Systematic Review] Two investigators (D.H. and C.S.) independently screened titles and abstracts of retrieved citations, retrieved full texts of eligible articles, and selected relevant articles matching the selection criteria described below. 

Two independent reviewers performed study selection. [Yes]

A3. Was a comprehensive literature search performed?

>[Patients and Methods, Systematic Review, Search Strategy] The general search terms were the same for the three databases, which are as follows: anorectal malformations, Hirschsprung disease, colostomy, and children. The exact search strategies are shown in Appendix 1.

Search included multiple databases and supplementary searches. [Yes]

A4. Was the status of publication used as an inclusion criterion? 

>No mention of including or excluding based on publication status. [NA]

A5. Was a list of studies (included and excluded) provided?

>No list of included/excluded studies provided. [No] 

A6. Were the characteristics of the included studies provided?

>[Results, Systematic Review of the Literature, Study Selection] The eight studies included a total of 2,954 patients. In all studies, type and location of the stoma was determined by the discretion of the operating surgeon. 

Limited characteristics of included studies provided. [No]

A7. Was the scientific quality of the included studies assessed and documented?

>[Patients and Methods, Systematic Review, Quality Assessment] Methodological quality was assessed with the checklist proposed by Downs and Black,[5] with a maximum score of 32 for the optimal study quality.

Quality assessed but individual study results not reported. [No]

A8. Was the scientific quality of the included studies used appropriately in formulating conclusions? 

>No mention of incorporating study quality in conclusions. [No]

A9. Were the methods used to combine the findings of studies appropriate?

>No quantitative synthesis performed. [NA] 

A10. Was the likelihood of publication bias assessed?

>No assessment of publication bias. [No]

A11. Was the conflict of interest included? 

>No statement about conflicts of interest. [No]

Here are my assessments for each AMSTAR criterion based on the provided text:

A1. [Yes] <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎For this meta-analysis, the Medline (1990–2009), Embase (1990–2009) and Cochrane databases were searched using the keyword ‘hypospadias’.&quot;</span> This indicates that the review protocol and search criteria were established before conducting the review.

A2. [No] There is no mention of duplicate study selection or data extraction. 

A3. [Yes] <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎The Medline (1990–Dec 2009), EMBASE (1990–Dec 2009) and Cochrane databases were searched using the single search term ‘hypospadias’ to ensure the broadest capture of relevant papers. There were no other limits applied to the search.&quot;</span> Multiple databases were searched without date or language restrictions.

A4. [No] The status of publication was not mentioned as an inclusion or exclusion criterion.

A5. [Yes] <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎129 papers were selected for full analysis; 23 papers met the inclusion criteria comprising 1872 TIP repairs and 1496 Mathieu repairs.&quot;</span> The numbers of included and excluded studies are provided.

A6. [Yes] <span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎In an aggregated form such as a table, data from the original studies should be provided on the participants, interventions and outcomes.&quot;</span> Table 1 provides aggregated data on interventions and outcomes.

A7. [No] The methodological quality of included studies was not assessed. 

A8. [NA] Methodological quality was not assessed so it could not be incorporated into conclusions.

A9. [Yes] <span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎For the pooled results, a test should be done to ensure the studies were combinable, to assess their homogeneity (i.e., Chi-squared test for homogeneity, I2 ). If heterogeneity exists a random effects model should be used and/or the clinical appropriateness of combining should be taken into consideration (i.e., is it sensible to combine?).&quot;</span> The authors mention assessing for heterogeneity. 

A10. [No] Publication bias was not assessed.

A11. [No] Sources of support were not reported for the systematic review or included studies.

<pre>
You are an expert in systematic reviews and are tasked to assess the methodological quality of a systematic review with the AMSTAR tool based on the full text of its publication. AMSTAR consists of the following items:

---
# AMSTAR
A1. Was an 'a priori' design provided? The research question and inclusion criteria should be established before the conduct of the review. Note: Need to refer to a protocol, ethics approval, or pre-determined/a priori published research objectives to score a “yes.”
A2. Was there duplicate study selection and data extraction? There should be at least two independent data extractors and a consensus procedure for disagreements should be in place. Note: 2 people do study selection, 2 people do data extraction, consensus process or one person checks the other’s work.
A3. Was a comprehensive literature search performed? At least two electronic sources should be searched. The report must include years and databases used (e.g., Central, EMBASE, and MEDLINE). Key words and/or MESH terms must be stated and where feasible the search strategy should be provided. All searches should be supplemented by consulting current contents, reviews, textbooks, specialized registers, or experts in the particular field of study, and by reviewing the references in the studies found. Note: If at least 2 sources + one supplementary strategy used, select “yes” (Cochrane register/Central counts as 2 sources; a grey literature search counts as supplementary).
A4. Was the status of publication (i.e. grey literature) used as an inclusion criterion? The authors should state that they searched for reports regardless of their publication type. The authors should state whether or not they excluded any reports (from the systematic review), based on their publication status, language etc. Note: If review indicates that there was a search for “grey literature” or “unpublished literature,” indicate “yes.” SIGLE database, dissertations, conference proceedings, and trial registries are all considered grey for this purpose. If searching a source that contains both grey and non-grey, must specify that they were searching for grey/unpublished lit.
A5. Was a list of studies (included and excluded) provided? A list of included and excluded studies should be provided. Note: Acceptable if the excluded studies are referenced. If there is an electronic link to the list but the link is dead, select “no.”
A6. Were the characteristics of the included studies provided? In an aggregated form such as a table, data from the original studies should be provided on the participants, interventions and outcomes. The ranges of characteristics in all the studies analyzed e.g., age, race, sex, relevant socioeconomic data, disease status, duration, severity, or other diseases should be reported. Note: Acceptable if not in table format as long as they are described as above. Paul "Follow-up poorly reported in general"
A7. Was the scientific quality of the included studies assessed and documented? 'A priori' methods of assessment should be provided (e.g., for effectiveness studies if the author(s) chose to include only randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled studies, or allocation concealment as inclusion criteria); for other types of studies alternative items will be relevant. Note: Can include use of a quality scoring tool or checklist, e.g., Jadad scale, risk of bias, sensitivity analysis, etc., or a description of quality items, with some kind of result for EACH study (“low” or “high” is fine, as long as it is clear which studies scored “low” and which scored “high”; a summary score/range for all studies is not acceptable).
A8. Was the scientific quality of the included studies used appropriately in formulating conclusions? The results of the methodological rigor and scientific quality should be considered in the analysis and the conclusions of the review, and explicitly stated in formulating recommendations. Note: Might say something such as “the results should be interpreted with caution due to poor quality of included studies.” Cannot score “yes” for this question if scored “no” for question A7.
A9. Were the methods used to combine the findings of studies appropriate? For the pooled results, a test should be done to ensure the studies were combinable, to assess their homogeneity (i.e., Chi-squared test for homogeneity, I2 ). If heterogeneity exists a random effects model should be used and/or the clinical appropriateness of combining should be taken into consideration (i.e., is it sensible to combine?). Note: Indicate “yes” if they mention or describe heterogeneity, i.e., if they explain that they cannot pool because of heterogeneity/variability between interventions.
A10. Was the likelihood of publication bias assessed? An assessment of publication bias should include a combination of graphical aids (e.g., funnel plot, other available tests) and/or statistical tests (e.g., Egger regression test, Hedges-Olken). Note: If no test values or funnel plot included, score “no”. Score “yes” if mentions that publication bias could not be assessed because there were fewer than 10 included studies.
A11. Was the conflict of interest included? Potential sources of support should be clearly acknowledged in both the systematic review and the included studies. Note: To get a “yes,” must indicate source of funding or support for the systematic review AND for each of the included studies.

For each of the 11 AMSTAR questions (A1 to A11) perform the following steps:
1. Extract 1-3 relevant quotes from the full text.
2. Explain your reasoning in 1 sentence.
3. Respond to the question with either "[Yes]" if adequate, "[No]" if inadequate, or "[NA]" if not applicable or not relevant to the text (for example, combining data in quantitative synthesis (A9) or assessing publication bias (A11) in the context of a systematic review without a meta-analysis).

Before stopping, make sure you've processed all 11 AMSTAR questions. Do not provide a final summary paragraph in the end.
