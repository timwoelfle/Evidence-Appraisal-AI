1. Eligibility:
   - ""People with multiple sclerosis were screened on the General Health Questionnaire 12 and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, and those with low mood were recruited."" [Pg. 2]
   - ""Participants were included who scored >2 on the General Health Questionnaire 12, 7 on the anxiety and depression subscales of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale."" [Pg. 3]
   - ""Those who were not able to complete the outcome measures, such as people with visual problems, were visited by a researcher who was unaware of their group allocation, who completed the questionnaires with them."" [Pg. 4]

2. The eligibility criteria in this trial are relatively pragmatic, as they focus on low mood, which is a common symptom in multiple sclerosis patients. The inclusion criteria are not excessively restrictive, and the researchers made an effort to accommodate participants with visual problems. However, the exclusion of participants who could not complete the outcome measures suggests a slightly less pragmatic approach. Score: [4]

The trial's primary outcome is relevant to participants, as it aims to determine the effectiveness of a novel computer-assisted cognitive rehabilitation intervention MAPSS-MS in a multi-site trial with persons with MS. The trial did not use a surrogate, physiological outcome, central adjudication or use assessment expertise that is not available in usual care, or measure the outcome at an earlier time than in usual care.

    Score: [5]

17. Primary analysis:
    - ""The effects of the intervention on outcomes were assessed over an 8-month period, with measurements at baseline, immediately after the 8-week MAPPS intervention, and at 3 and 6 months post-intervention.""
    - ""Statistical significance was set at p < .05.""

18. All data were included in the analysis of the primary outcome, as the trial used intention to treat with all available data, and did not exclude ineligible post-randomisation participants, include only completers or those following the treatment protocol.

1. Eligibility:
   - ""Patients were recruited in collaboration with six Danish regional MS clinics and The Danish MS Society. Inclusion criteria were (1) 18–60 years of age, (2) ⩽2 years since clinical diagnosis with relapsing remitting MS (RRMS) and (3) no relapses or changes in medication status 8 weeks prior to inclusion."" [Page 1621]
   - ""Eligibility was confirmed by project nurses based on patients’ medical records. Patients gave informed written consent prior to inclusion."" [Page 1621]

2. The eligibility criteria for this trial are relatively pragmatic, as they only require a recent diagnosis of RRMS and no relapses or medication changes in the past 8 weeks. The age range is also quite broad, which increases the generalizability of the trial. However, the fact that patients were recruited through MS clinics and the Danish MS Society may introduce some selection bias, as these patients may be more motivated or have more severe symptoms than the general MS population. Additionally, the requirement for written consent may exclude some patients who are unable to provide it. Overall, I would rate the eligibility domain as moderately pragmatic: Score: [4]

The follow-up and flexibility (adherence) domains are the least pragmatic, with scores of 3. This suggests that the trial is generally well-designed and appropriate for the research question, but could benefit from some modifications to increase the pragmatism of certain domains. For example, the trial could consider recruiting patients from a more diverse range of settings, such as primary care clinics or community centers, to increase the generalizability of the trial. Additionally, the trial could consider using more flexible adherence measures, such as self-reported adherence or remote monitoring, to reduce the burden on participants and improve engagement.

In summary, the PRECIS-2 scores for the trial are as follows:

* Eligibility: [4]
* Recruitment: [3]
* Setting: [5]
* Organization: [1]
* Flexibility (delivery): [5]
* Flexibility (adherence): [5]
* Follow-up: [5]
* Primary outcome: [5]
* Primary analysis: [5]

These scores suggest that the trial was generally pragmatic, with some aspects that were more explanatory. The trial was conducted in a hospital setting, with a structured 8-week program of mindfulness training, and included all data in the analysis of the primary outcome. The trial was pragmatic in terms of eligibility, follow-up, primary outcome, and primary analysis, but was more explanatory in terms of organization and flexibility (adherence). The trial was also slightly more explanatory in terms of recruitment and flexibility (delivery), as some additional effort was made to recruit participants through advertisements and the intervention was delivered in a structured 8-week program.","
1. Eligibility:
   - ""A total of 150 patients were randomly assigned to the intervention (n  76) or to UC (n  74).""
   - ""Excluded were patients with reported or medically recorded diagnoses of current serious psychological disorders other than depression and anxiety syndromes, evidence of dementia as indicated by testing below the fifth percentile in at least 3 of 6 dimensions of neuropsychological functioning (i.e., attention and concentration, processing speed, executive function, verbal memory, and verbal processing), other currently life-threatening or severely disabling physical disorders, current MS exacerbation, symptomatic MS medication altered in the last 3 months, other disorders of the CNS, pregnancy, or inability to speak or read German.""
   - ""The study was conducted from February 2007 to March 2009.""

2. Reasoning:
   The trial included patients with relapsing-remitting or secondary progressive MS, with an EDSS score of 6 and a 1 step increase within the last year. Patients were excluded if they had current serious psychological disorders other than depression and anxiety syndromes, evidence of dementia, other currently life-threatening or severely disabling physical disorders, current MS exacerbation, symptomatic MS medication altered in the last 3 months, other disorders of the CNS, pregnancy, or inability to speak or read German. The trial was conducted from February 2007 to March 2009.

2. Reasoning:
   The eligibility criteria for this trial are relatively pragmatic, as they include a wide range of participants with Multiple Sclerosis and foot drop. The inclusion criteria are broad and do not require any specific subtype or severity of the disease. The exclusion criteria are also relatively limited, mainly focusing on contraindications to functional electrical stimulation or other conditions that may affect gait.

   The recruitment process for this trial is relatively pragmatic, as it involves informing potential participants about the study and allowing them to self-select into the trial. The randomization process is also pragmatic, as it uses simple randomization with sealed envelopes.

   - ""Patients received their allocated treatment from the recruiting hospital. Care pathways for all patients included outpatient- and community-based rehabilitation, which primarily comprised 1 or more 1-on-1 sessions with a physiotherapist that focused on restoring function.""
   - ""Follow-up was up to 2 years (until April 2013) for all patients.""

2. Reasoning:
   The setting for this trial is relatively pragmatic, as it involves providing care pathways for all patients that include outpatient- and community-based rehabilitation. The trial also follows patients for up to 2 years, which is a relatively long follow-up period. This suggests that the setting for this trial is relatively pragmatic, as it allows for a wide range of patients to be included and followed over a long period of time.

1. Organization:
   - ""Participants allocated to surgery received either internal fracture fixation (eg, with plate and screws) that preserved the humeral head or humeral head replacement (hemiarthroplasty). Participants allocated to nonsurgical treatment were given a sling for the injured arm for as long as deemed necessary (3 weeks was suggested), followed by active rehabilitation.""
   - ""Delivery of care and rehabilitation, which was freely available for all patients, incorporated the following 3 set measures to ensure good standards of care within the National Health Service: provision of an information leaflet on personal care during sling immobilization; a basic treatment protocol to guide physiotherapy; and promotion of home exercises.""

2. Reasoning:
   The organization of care for this trial is relatively pragmatic, as it involves providing participants with either internal fracture fixation or humeral head replacement if they are allocated to surgery, and a sling and active rehabilitation if they are allocated to nonsurgical treatment. The trial also incorporates set measures to ensure good standards of care within the National Health Service, such as provision of an information leaflet, a basic treatment protocol, and promotion of home exercises. This suggests that the organization of care for this trial is relatively pragmatic, as it allows for a wide range of patients to be included and treated in a consistent and standardized manner.

1. Flexibility (delivery):
   - ""It was emphasized that good standards of care, both surgical and nonsurgical, should be provided throughout the treatment pathway for the injury, including surgical care or management of the sling, postoperative care, and rehabilitation in both groups.""
   - ""Participating hospitals did not introduce new or experimental interventions for these fractures during the study.""

2. Reasoning:
   The flexibility in how the intervention is delivered for this trial is relatively pragmatic, as it emphasizes the importance of providing good standards of care for both surgical and nonsurgical treatments. Participating hospitals did not introduce new or experimental interventions for these fractures during the study, which suggests that the flexibility in how the intervention is delivered is relatively pragmatic.

   - ""Physiotherapy treatment log data demonstrated equal access and implementation between groups, with similarly high numbers of participants recorded as performing home exercises (109 in surgical group vs 103 in nonsurgical group) in both groups.""

2. Reasoning:
   The flexibility in how participants must adhere to the intervention for this trial is relatively pragmatic, as it allows for rehabilitation care to be provided by physiotherapists in inpatient, outpatient, and community settings. Physiotherapy treatment log data also demonstrated equal access and implementation between groups, with similarly high numbers of participants recorded as performing home exercises in both groups. This suggests that the flexibility in how participants must adhere to the intervention is relatively pragmatic.

   - ""The primary outcome was the Oxford Shoulder Score (OSS), which is a shoulder-specific outcome measure validated in a UK population. The OSS provides a total score based on the patient’s subjective assessment of pain and function. It contains 12 items, each with 5 categories of response, and a range of total scores of 0-48 (higher scores indicate better outcomes). The OSS was collected by postal questionnaires at 6, 12, and 24 months. There was no trial-related clinical assessment or radiological follow-up of patients.""

2. Reasoning:
   The intensity of measurement and follow-up of participants in the trial is relatively pragmatic, as it involves collecting data via hospital forms, baseline x-rays, and patient questionnaires at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months.

1. Eligibility:
   - ""Patients were eligible for inclusion if they were aged 16 years or older and presented within 3 weeks after sustaining a displaced fracture of the proximal humerus that involved the surgical neck. The degree of displacement had to be sufficient for the treating surgeon to consider surgical intervention but did not have to meet the displacement criteria of Neer for inclusion in the trial.""
   - ""Excluded patients had associated dislocation of the injured shoulder joint, open fracture, insufficient mental capacity to understand the trial or instructions for rehabilitation, comorbidities precluding surgery or anesthesia, clear indication for surgery such as severe soft-tissue compromise, multiple injuries (upper limb fractures), pathological fracture (other than osteoporotic), terminal illness, or were not a resident in the hospital catchment area.""

2. Reasoning:
   The eligibility criteria for this trial are relatively pragmatic, as they allow for a wide range of patients to be included. The only requirement is that they have a displaced fracture of the proximal humerus involving the surgical neck, and that the treating surgeon considers surgical intervention to be appropriate. The exclusion criteria are also relatively broad, but they do not seem to be overly restrictive. Overall, the eligibility criteria for this trial seem to be relatively pragmatic, as they allow for a wide range of patients to be included.
