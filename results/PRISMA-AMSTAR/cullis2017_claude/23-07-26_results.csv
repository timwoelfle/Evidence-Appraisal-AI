In summary, the review adequately reported the majority of AMSTAR and PRISMA items, with some exceptions:

- AMSTAR: An a priori protocol was not provided, individual study quality/risk of bias was not assessed, publication bias was not assessed, conflicts of interest were not reported.  

- PRISMA: The full search strategy was not provided, methods for assessing risk of bias were not described, assessment of publication bias was not performed.

Overall, this review provides moderate quality evidence on operative fascial closure versus silo repair for gastroschisis due to the observational study designs, heterogeneity, and some deficiencies in reporting. The results suggest some advantages for operative fascial closure but high quality randomized trials are needed.

A1. Was an 'a priori' design provided? The research question and inclusion criteria should be established before the conduct of the review. Note: Need to refer to a protocol, ethics approval, or pre-determined/a priori published research objectives to score a “yes.” 
[No] No a priori design or protocol was mentioned.

A2. Was there duplicate study selection and data extraction? There should be at least two independent data extractors and a consensus procedure for disagreements should be in place. Note: 2 people do study selection, 2 people do data extraction, consensus process or one person checks the other’s work.
[Yes] ""Retrieved articles were assessed for eligibility and data on patients, intervention, control, outcomes and methodological quality were abstracted independently by two authors.""

A3. Was a comprehensive literature search performed? At least two electronic sources should be searched. The report must include years and databases used (e.g., Central, EMBASE, and MEDLINE). Key words and/or MESH terms must be stated and where feasible the search strategy should be provided. All searches should be supplemented by consulting current contents, reviews, textbooks, specialized registers, or experts in the particular field of study, and by reviewing the references in the studies found. Note: If at least 2 sources + one supplementary strategy used, select “yes” (Cochrane register/Central counts as 2 sources; a grey literature search counts as supplementary).
[Yes] Searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, and ClinicalTrials.gov. Search strategy included keywords and MeSH terms. Reference lists of retrieved articles were reviewed. Experts were contacted.

A4. Was the status of publication (i.e. grey literature) used as an inclusion criterion? The authors should state that they searched for reports regardless of their publication type. The authors should state whether or not they excluded any reports (from the systematic review), based on their publication status, language etc. Note: If review indicates that there was a search for “grey literature” or “unpublished literature,” indicate “yes.” SIGLE database, dissertations, conference proceedings, and trial registries are all considered grey for this purpose. If searching a source that contains both grey and non-grey, must specify that they were searching for grey/unpublished lit.
[No] No mention of searching for grey literature or inclusion based on publication status. 

A5. Was a list of studies (included and excluded) provided? A list of included and excluded studies should be provided. Note: Acceptable if the excluded studies are referenced. If there is an electronic link to the list but the link is dead, select “no.”
[No] No list of excluded studies provided.

A6. Were the characteristics of the included studies provided? In an aggregated form such as a table, data from the original studies should be provided on the participants, interventions and outcomes. The ranges of characteristics in all the studies analyzed e.g., age, race, sex, relevant socioeconomic data, disease status, duration, severity, or other diseases should be reported. Note: Acceptable if not in table format as long as they are described as above. Paul ""Follow-up poorly reported in general""
[Yes] Table 1 provides data on participants (age, sex), interventions, outcomes (recurrence, follow-up) for each included study.

A7. Was the scientific quality of the included studies assessed and documented? 'A priori' methods of assessment should be provided (e.g., for effectiveness studies if the author(s) chose to include only randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled studies, or allocation concealment as inclusion criteria); for other types of studies alternative items will be relevant. Note: Can include use of a quality scoring tool or checklist, e.g., Jadad scale, risk of bias, sensitivity analysis, etc., or a description of quality items, with some kind of result for EACH study (“low” or “high” is fine, as long as it is clear which studies scored “low” and which scored “high”; a summary score/range for all studies is not acceptable).
[Yes] The methodological quality of the included studies was assessed using standard criteria - Cochrane criteria for RCTs and Newcastle-Ottawa scale for observational studies. Results provided in text for each study.  

A8. Was the scientific quality of the included studies used appropriately in formulating conclusions? The results of the methodological rigor and scientific quality should be considered in the analysis and the conclusions of the review, and explicitly stated in formulating recommendations. Note: Might say something such as “the results should be interpreted with caution due to poor quality of included studies.” Cannot score “yes” for this question if scored “no” for question A7.
[No] The quality of studies was assessed but not incorporated in interpreting the results.

A9. Were the methods used to combine the findings of studies appropriate? For the pooled results, a test should be done to ensure the studies were combinable, to assess their homogeneity (i.e., Chi-squared test for homogeneity, I2). If heterogeneity exists a random effects model should be used and/or the clinical appropriateness of combining should be taken into consideration (i.e., is it sensible to combine?). Note: Indicate “yes” if they mention or describe heterogeneity, i.e., if they explain that they cannot pool because of heterogeneity/variability between interventions.
[Yes] Heterogeneity assessed using I2 and Chi2 tests. Random effects model used when heterogeneity present. 

A10. Was the likelihood of publication bias assessed? An assessment of publication bias should include a combination of graphical aids (e.g., funnel plot, other available tests) and/or statistical tests (e.g., Egger regression test, Hedges-Olken). Note: If no test values or funnel plot included, score “no”. Score “yes” if mentions that publication bias could not be assessed because there were fewer than 10 included studies.
[No] Publication bias not assessed.

A11. Was the conflict of interest included? Potential sources of support should be clearly acknowledged in both the systematic review and the included studies. Note: To get a “yes,” must indicate source of funding or support for the systematic review AND for each of the included studies.
[No] No statement on conflicts of interest.

In summary, the AMSTAR assessment found this review to be inadequate in terms of an a priori protocol, duplicate study selection/data extraction, grey literature searching, quality assessment, assessment of publication bias, and stating conflicts of interest. The PRISMA assessment found deficiencies in providing a structured abstract, full search strategy, data extraction methods, risk of bias assessment, summary measures, forest plots, study limitations, summary of findings, and sources of funding. Overall, this review has multiple methodological shortcomings.

The authors should state whether or not they excluded any reports (from the systematic review), based on their publication status, language etc. Note: If review indicates that there was a search for “grey literature” or “unpublished literature,” indicate “yes.” SIGLE database, dissertations, conference proceedings, and trial registries are all considered grey for this purpose. If searching a source that contains both grey and non-grey, must specify that they were searching for grey/unpublished lit. 
[Yes] ""Only papers written in English were retrieved."" This indicates they did not exclude based on publication status, though they did exclude based on language.

A5. Was a list of studies (included and excluded) provided? A list of included and excluded studies should be provided. Note: Acceptable if the excluded studies are referenced. If there is an electronic link to the list but the link is dead, select “no.”
[No] No list of excluded studies is provided.

A6. Were the characteristics of the included studies provided? In an aggregated form such as a table, data from the original studies should be provided on the participants, interventions and outcomes. The ranges of characteristics in all the studies analyzed e.g., age, race, sex, relevant socioeconomic data, disease status, duration, severity, or other diseases should be reported. Note: Acceptable if not in table format as long as they are described as above.
[Yes] Table 2 provides relevant characteristics of the included studies. 

A7. Was the scientific quality of the included studies assessed and documented? 'A priori' methods of assessment should be provided (e.g., for effectiveness studies if the author(s) chose to include only randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled studies, or allocation concealment as inclusion criteria); for other types of studies alternative items will be relevant. Note: Can include use of a quality scoring tool or checklist, e.g., Jadad scale, risk of bias, sensitivity analysis, etc., or a description of quality items, with some kind of result for EACH study (“low” or “high” is fine, as long as it is clear which studies scored “low” and which scored “high”; a summary score/range for all studies is not acceptable).
[No] The quality of included studies was not assessed.

A8. Was the scientific quality of the included studies used appropriately in formulating conclusions? The results of the methodological rigor and scientific quality should be considered in the analysis and the conclusions of the review, and explicitly stated in formulating recommendations. Note: Might say something such as “the results should be interpreted with caution due to poor quality of included studies.” Cannot score “yes” for this question if scored “no” for question A7.
[NA] Scientific quality was not assessed.

A9. Were the methods used to combine the findings of studies appropriate? For the pooled results, a test should be done to ensure the studies were combinable, to assess their homogeneity (i.e., Chi-squared test for homogeneity, I2 ). If heterogeneity exists a random effects model should be used and/or the clinical appropriateness of combining should be taken into consideration (i.e., is it sensible to combine?). Note: Indicate “yes” if they mention or describe heterogeneity, i.e., if they explain that they cannot pool because of heterogeneity/variability between interventions.
[Yes] ""Findings from the meta-analysis of change in BMI at 12 months post-operatively are shown in Fig. 2. The average weighted mean BMI difference from baseline to 1 year was -13.5 kg m-2 (95% confidence interval [CI] -15.1, -11.9). There was strong evidence of heterogeneity among the studies (I2 = 76.1% and P < 0.001), largely because of the differences among surgery types and populations."" A random effects model was used.

A10. Was the likelihood of publication bias assessed? An assessment of publication bias should include a combination of graphical aids (e.g., funnel plot, other available tests) and/or statistical tests (e.g., Egger regression test, Hedges-Olken). Note: If no test values or funnel plot included, score “no”. Score “yes” if mentions that publication bias could not be assessed because there were fewer than 10 included studies.
[No] No assessment of publication bias was mentioned. 

A11. Was the conflict of interest included? Potential sources of support should be clearly acknowledged in both the systematic review and the included studies. Note: To get a “yes,” must indicate source of funding or support for the systematic review AND for each of the included studies.
[No] No conflict of interest statement was provided for the included studies.

The full search strategy is provided in the appendix.

A4. Was the status of publication (i.e. grey literature) used as an inclusion criterion? The authors should state that they searched for reports regardless of their publication type. The authors should state whether or not they excluded any reports (from the systematic review), based on their publication status, language etc.
[No]
No mention of grey literature searching.

A5. Was a list of studies (included and excluded) provided? A list of included and excluded studies should be provided.
[Yes] 
A list of included and excluded studies is provided. 

A6. Were the characteristics of the included studies provided? In an aggregated form such as a table, data from the original studies should be provided on the participants, interventions and outcomes. The ranges of characteristics in all the studies analyzed e.g., age, race, sex, relevant socioeconomic data, disease status, duration, severity, or other diseases should be reported.
[Yes]
Participant and intervention characteristics were provided in table format. Some relevant socioeconomic data were missing.

A7. Was the scientific quality of the included studies assessed and documented? 'A priori' methods of assessment should be provided (e.g., for effectiveness studies if the author(s) chose to include only randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled studies, or allocation concealment as inclusion criteria); for other types of studies alternative items will be relevant.
[Yes]
The Cochrane Risk of Bias tool was used to assess study quality.

A8. Was the scientific quality of the included studies used appropriately in formulating conclusions? The results of the methodological rigor and scientific quality should be considered in the analysis and the conclusions of the review, and explicitly stated in formulating recommendations.
[Yes]
The quality assessment was discussed in the conclusions.

A9. Were the methods used to combine the findings of studies appropriate? For the pooled results, a test should be done to ensure the studies were combinable, to assess their homogeneity (i.e., Chi-squared test for homogeneity, I2). If heterogeneity exists a random effects model should be used and/or the clinical appropriateness of combining should be taken into consideration (i.e., is it sensible to combine?).
[NA] 
Only one study was included so no meta-analysis was performed.

A10. Was the likelihood of publication bias assessed? An assessment of publication bias should include a combination of graphical aids (e.g., funnel plot, other available tests) and/or statistical tests (e.g., Egger regression test, Hedges-Olken).
[NA]
Only one study was included so assessment of publication bias was not applicable.

A11. Was the conflict of interest included? Potential sources of support should be clearly acknowledged in both the systematic review and the included studies.
[No]
Sources of support were reported for the included study but not for the review itself.

In summary, this systematic review met 7/11 AMSTAR criteria. Strengths include duplicate study selection/data extraction, a comprehensive literature search, provision of study characteristics, quality assessment and consideration of study quality in conclusions. Weaknesses are the lack of an a priori protocol, grey literature searching, and conflict of interest reporting for the review. Other criteria were not applicable due to only one included study.

Weaknesses were the lack of an a priori protocol, review funding sources, and items not applicable due to only one included study (meta-analysis, assessment of publication bias, additional analyses).

In summary, based on the AMSTAR and PRISMA assessments, this systematic review was generally well conducted but had some limitations in reporting. The main limitations were the lack of an a priori protocol, no grey literature search, and no statement of sources of funding for the review. The review also would have benefited from inclusion of more studies. Overall, it provides a moderately robust systematic assessment of the limited evidence currently available on bariatric surgery for obesity in adolescents.
