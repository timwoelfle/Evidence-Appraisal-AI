Material and methods: A systematic review was conducted using studies identified by a literature search between January 1990 and March 2014. All English language articles reporting on a minimum of five patients 18-years old, treated with flexible ureteroscopy and lasertripsy for stone disease were included. Results: A total of six studies (282 patients) were reported, with a mean age of 7.3 years (range 0.25e17 years). The stone sizes ranged from 1 to 30 mm. The mean stone-free rate across the three studies was 85.5% (range 58.0e93.0%) after initial ureteroscopy, with a postoperative stent inserted in 81.8% (range 66.7e98.0%). There were a total of 35 complications (12.4%), with the most severe complication being a Clavien class III (five ureteral injuries, one urinoma). There were no deaths in any of the studies. Conclusion: The present review shows that FURSL for management of renal calculi in the paediatric population is an effective and safe procedure.

The aim of this systematic review was to assess all available literature on neophalloplasty in infancy with an interest in technical alternatives and clinical outcome. Materials and methods: We performed a Pubmed search using the terms: neophalloplasty, neophallus, and phalloplasty, and selected articles that presented technical alternatives for penile construction in cases of penile dysgenesis, especially aphallia in children and/or adolescents. Results: A total of 319 articles were identified in the initial search. Among the different techniques presented in 19 papers collected, we categorized reconstructive procedures into two groups: microsurgical and non-microsurgical techniques. Among the microsurgical techniques, procedures such as the osteocutaneous fibular flap (n Z 18), the myocutaneous latissimus dorsi flap (n Z 24), and the radial forearm free flap (n Z 293) were reported. Among the non-microsurgical techniques, we found a wider range of technical options (6 in total). Most were based on groin, abdominal, and scrotal flaps. Long-term reports on the functionability of the neophallus and psychological aspects of the patients are lacking. Conclusion: In assessing recent literature, it seems rational that neophalloplasty should be regarded as the preferred strategy for boys born with aphallia, in opposition to female gender assignment.""

The main objective of this study was to determine morbidity and mortality for this procedure. Methods: All published cases of esophagogastric dissociation in children were identified. Series were updated where possible by personal communication with the author. Patient characteristics, indications, morbidity, and mortality were analyzed. Results: One hundred eighty-one cases were identified. One hundred seventeen were primary operations and 64 were rescue procedures. There were 29 (16.0%) early complications and 28 (15.5%) late complications with 6 (3.3%) deaths related to the procedure of a total of 35 deaths. Twenty-one patients (11.6%) required re-operation in the study periods. Conclusions: Esophagogastric dissociation has an acceptable morbidity and mortality.

- Quote: ""Abstract: Background Achalasia is a rare idiopathic neuromuscular disorder of the esophagus, characterized as a syndrome of impaired relaxation of the lower esophageal sphincter and decreased peristalsis of the esophageal body. Objective The primary objective is to determine the best first-line treatment for pediatric achalasia based on the consolidation of the current literature that compares outcomes after pneumatic dilatation (PD) versus surgical myotomy (Heller esophagomyotomy [HM]). Data Sources A systematic review of English articles using OVID was performed. Study Selection OVID was used to search for articles focusing on the treatment of pediatric esophageal achalasia with PD versus HM. Data Extraction Independent extraction of data was performed by N.E.S using predefined data fields. Data Synthesis Seven articles were included in the systematic review. Techniques of HM and PD varied widely. The best first-line treatment of pediatric achalasia was determined to be HM in two articles, PD in one article, and equal efficacy in one article. Three articles concluded that appropriate initial treatment was determined by the age of the child. Conclusion Adequate comparative data are lacking to determine the ideal treatment of pediatric achalasia. Appropriately designed randomized controlled trials with long-term follow-up are needed to determine ideal treatment algorithms in pediatric achalasia.""

In this review, we aim to elucidate the aspects of LESS for major urological procedures in the pediatric population. Materials and methods: An in-depth search of the literature was performed in the databases of PubMed and Scopus, for studies investigating the technical aspects and clinical outcomes of partial nephrectomies, nephrectomies, nephroureterectomies, varicocelectomies and pyeloplasties in children. Data on parameters such as operation time, instrumentation, perioperative complications, hospital stay and follow up period were collected and further analyzed cumulatively. Results: Twenty nine studies met the inclusion criteria incorporating 386 patients who underwent 401 procedures. There were no major intraoperative complications, with only 19 patients (4.73%) facing postoperative complications. No perioperative deaths were reported.

Abstract / Structured summary: Provide a structured summary including, as applicable: background; objectives; data sources; study eligibility criteria, participants, and interventions; study appraisal and synthesis methods; results; limitations; conclusions and implications of key findings; systematic review registration number.
- Quote: ""Abstract Objectives To compare the safety and efficacy of minimally invasive surgery (MIS) with traditional open surgical approach for congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH). Methods A literature search was performed using the PubMed database, Embase, and the Cochrane central register of controlled trials using a defined set of criteria. The outcomes, which include post-operative mortality, incidence of hernia recurrence, rates of patch use and complications, were analyzed. Results We investigated nine studies, which included 507 patients. All studies were non-randomized historical control trials. The MIS group had a significantly lower rate of post-operative death with a risk ratio of 0.26 [95 % confidence interval (CI) 0.10–0.68; p = 0.006] but a greater incidence of hernia recurrence with a risk ratio of 3.42 (95 % CI 1.98–5.88; p \ 0.00001). Rates of prosthetic patch use were similar between the two groups. Fewer cases of surgical complications were found in the MIS group with a risk ratio of 0.66 (95 % CI 0.47–0.94; p = 0.02). Conclusions MIS for CDH repair is associated with lower post-operative mortality and morbidity compared with traditional open repair. Although rate of patch use appears to be comparable, the increased risk of CDH recurrence should not be ignored. The lack of well-controlled prospective trials still limits strong evaluations of the two surgical techniques.""

Surgical repair via laparotomy or thoracotomy is the traditional treatment for patients with CDH. Since the first report by Silen et al. on thoracoscopic CDH repair in an adolescent in 1995 [2], minimally invasive surgery (MIS) techniques, both laparoscopic and thoracoscopic, have been considered as alternative approaches for CDH repair. However, this new technique has not gained widespread acceptance among surgeons mainly because of the controversy involving its safety and efficacy, such as mortality, recurrence rate and complication rate.""

- Quote: ""Abstract Objectives To compare the safety and efficacy of minimally invasive surgery (MIS) with traditional open surgical approach for congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH). Methods A literature search was performed using the PubMed database, Embase, and the Cochrane central register of controlled trials using a defined set of criteria. The outcomes, which include post-operative mortality, incidence of hernia recurrence, rates of patch use and complications, were analyzed. Results We investigated nine studies, which included 507 patients. All studies were non-randomized historical control trials. The MIS group had a significantly lower rate of post-operative death with a risk ratio of 0.26 [95 % confidence interval (CI) 0.10–0.68; p = 0.006] but a greater incidence of hernia recurrence with a risk ratio of 3.42 (95 % CI 1.98–5.88; p \ 0.00001). Rates of prosthetic patch use were similar between the two groups. Fewer cases of surgical complications were found in the MIS group with a risk ratio of 0.66 (95 % CI 0.47–0.94; p = 0.02). Conclusions MIS for CDH repair is associated with lower post-operative mortality and morbidity compared with traditional open repair. Although rate of patch use appears to be comparable, the increased risk of CDH recurrence should not be ignored. The lack of well-controlled prospective trials still limits strong evaluations of the two surgical techniques.""

P3. Introduction / Rationale: Describe the rationale for the review in the context of what is already known.
- Quote: ""Congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) is a congenital defect in diaphragm development, which occurs in approximately 1 in 2500–4000 live births [1]. Surgical repair via laparotomy or thoracotomy is the traditional treatment for patients with CDH. Since the first report by Silen et al. on thoracoscopic CDH repair in an adolescent in 1995 [2], minimally invasive surgery (MIS) techniques, both laparoscopic and thoracoscopic, have been considered as alternative approaches for CDH repair. However, this new technique has not gained widespread acceptance among surgeons mainly because of the controversy involving its safety and efficacy, such as mortality, recurrence rate and complication rate.""

The aim of this study was to identify clinical evidence about the reliability of this technique in the recent literature. Methods: We performed a Medline search for articles published during the last 10 years, using the key words “varicocele,” “treatment,” and “adolescent.” As limits, we used last 10 years, adolescent, clinical trials, randomized controlled trials, meta-analysis, and multicenter retrospective and prospective studies. The results were investigated in recurrence and hydrocele formation. Results: We pooled 37 studies, but 26 of these were excluded because they were neither relevant nor concerned an adolescent population. Meta-analysis showed that there was no statistical difference between laparoscopic surgery and open surgery in recurrence rate and postoperative hydrocele rate. In the laparoscopic group, the incidence of recurrence was higher in the patients undergoing artery ligation compared to patients undergoing artery and venous ligation. Furthermore, a lower rate of postoperative hydrocele was recorded in patients undergoing dye injections before laparoscopic ligation. Conclusions: Meta-analysis and literature analysis showed that the results after laparoscopic varicocelectomy are comparable to other surgical procedures. The laparoscopic approach has the advantage to treat simultaneously bilateral varicocele.""

- Quote: ""Abstract: Purpose: Laparoscopic varicocelectomy has gained popularity in recent years. The aim of this study was to identify clinical evidence about the reliability of this technique in the recent literature. Methods: We performed a Medline search for articles published during the last 10 years, using the key words “varicocele,” “treatment,” and “adolescent.” As limits, we used last 10 years, adolescent, clinical trials, randomized controlled trials, meta-analysis, and multicenter retrospective and prospective studies. The results were investigated in recurrence and hydrocele formation. Results: We pooled 37 studies, but 26 of these were excluded because they were neither relevant nor concerned an adolescent population. Meta-analysis showed that there was no statistical difference between laparoscopic surgery and open surgery in recurrence rate and postoperative hydrocele rate. In the laparoscopic group, the incidence of recurrence was higher in the patients undergoing artery ligation compared to patients undergoing artery and venous ligation. Furthermore, a lower rate of postoperative hydrocele was recorded in patients undergoing dye injections before laparoscopic ligation. Conclusions: Meta-analysis and literature analysis showed that the results after laparoscopic varicocelectomy are comparable to other surgical procedures. The laparoscopic approach has the advantage to treat simultaneously bilateral varicocele.""
