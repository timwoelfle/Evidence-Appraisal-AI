65,PRISMA,"Our review examined the safety and efficacy of the laparoscopic approach in the management of inguinal hernias in infants and children. Ten comparative studies were reviewed. Although the data is limited, the laparoscopic approach was associated with a trend towards higher recurrence rate. A sensitivity analysis had shown a comparable recurrence rate among groups, where studies limited to infants, or girls, or addressing incarcerated hernia, or having a short follow-up period were excluded. This could be explained partially by refinements in techniques and by achieving the required learning curve in the recent included studies. A narrative review by Bharathi et al. [28] of 22 studies (3 comparative studies) have shown a recurrence rate ranging from 0 to 5% for the laparoscopic inguinal herniotomy, which is comparable with that for open repair. A recent case series by Parelkar et al. [29] have demonstrated technical modifications where they were able to bring down the recurrence rate from 2.9 to 0%. The operative time for unilateral cases was significantly longer for those who underwent minimal access surgery for inguinal hernia in children. The direction of this effect was consistent; however, the included studies were heterogeneous due to various reasons including technical, surgeon, patient, and institutional factors. In those who underwent bilateral repairs, there was a trend towards shorter operative time in favor of laparoscopic approach. The direction of this effect was consistent and homogenous among studies’ reported operative time for bilateral repairs [17, 19, 20, 22]. This temporal efficacy that has been observed for bilateral cases could be explained partially by avoiding additional access for the opposite side [23, 28].",fulltext,"Our review examined the safety and efficacy of the laparoscopic approach in the management of inguinal hernias in infants and children.

This could be explained partially by refinements in techniques and by achieving the required learning curve in the recent included studies. A narrative review by Bharathi et al. [28] of 22 studies (3 comparative studies) have shown a recurrence rate ranging from 0 to 5% for the laparoscopic inguinal herniotomy, which is comparable with that for open repair. A recent case series by Parelkar et al. [29] have demonstrated technical modifications where they were able to bring down the recurrence rate from 2.9 to 0%. The operative time for unilateral cases was significantly longer for those who underwent minimal access surgery for inguinal hernia in children. The direction of this effect was consistent; however, the included studies were heterogeneous due to various reasons including technical, surgeon, Study or Subgroup Niyogi 2010 Tsai 2010 Endo 2009 Koivusalo 2009 Bharathi 2008 Hassan 2007 Koivusalo 2007 Oue 2005 Chan 2005 Antao 2004 Total (95% CI) Total events Heterogeneity: Chi² = 9.72, df = 7 (P = 0.20); I² = 28% Test for overall effect: Z = 1.63 (P = 0.10) Events 2 1 2 2 1 4 1 0 0 4 17 Total 58 90 1257 47 35 15 18 183 41 58 1802 Events 9 1 2 1 0 0 0 0 0 3 16 Total 241 49 308 42 34 18 15 21 42 242 1012 Weight 29.9% 11.4% 28.5% 9.0% 4.3% 2.9% 4.4% 9.6% 100.0% M-H, Fixed, 95% CI 0.92 [0.19, 4.38] 0.54 [0.03, 8.82] 0.24 [0.03, 1.74] 1.82 [0.16, 20.85] 3.00 [0.12, 76.24] 14.48 [0.71, 294.61] 2.66 [0.10, 70.11] Not estimable Not estimable 5.90 [1.28, 27.14] 1.81 [0.89, 3.67] Year 2010 2010 2009 2009 2008 2007 2007 2005 2005 2004 oitaRsddOoitaRsddOnepOcipo a csarapaL M-H, Fixed, 95% CI 0.01 0.1 1 10 100 Favours laparoscopic Favours open Study or Subgroup Tsai 2010 Niyogi 2010 Koivusalo 2009 Endo 2009 Bharathi 2008 Chan 2005 Total (95% CI) Total events Heterogeneity: Chi² = 2.87, df = 4 (P = 0.58); I² = 0% Test for overall effect: Z = 0.30 (P = 0.76) Events 1 2 2 2 1 0 8 Total 90 58 47 1257 35 41 1528 Events 1 9 1 2 0 0 13 Total 49 241 42 308 43 42 725 Weight 13.8% 36.2% 10.9% 34.5% 4.6% 100.0% M-H, Fixed, 95% CI 0.54 [0.03, 8.82] 0.92 [0.19, 4.38] 1.82 [0.16, 20.85] 0.24 [0.03, 1.74] 3.78 [0.15, 95.78] Not estimable 0.87 [0.34, 2.23] Year 2010 2010 2009 2009 2008 2005 oitaRsddOoitaRsddOnepOcipocsorapaL M-H, Fixed, 95% CI 0.01 0.1 1 10 100 Favours laparoscopic Favours open b Fig. 2 a Forest plot comparing recurrence rate for children treated with laparoscopic versus open inguinal herniotomy. b Sensitivity analysis of recurrence rate among children treated by laparoscopic versus open inguinal herniotomy Pediatr Surg Int (2011) 27:605–612 609 123 patient, and institutional factors.

The direction of this effect was consistent and homogenous among studies’ reported operative time for bilateral repairs [17, 19, 20, 22].

65,PRISMA,"Inguinal hernia repair is one of the most frequently performed pediatric surgical operations [1]. Open repair of an inguinal hernia has been accepted as the method of choice since it was first described more than 50 years ago due to its lower morbidity, good cosmesis, and lower rates of recurrence [2–4]. Several pediatric laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair techniques have been introduced over the last few years [5–15]. Some centers use laparoscopes routinely for inguinal hernia repair in children because of the belief that the laparoscopic repair is less painful to the patients, results in earlier recovery and better cosmesis [16, 17]. In addition, laparoscopic repair also allows contralateral patent process vaginalis (PPV)/hernias to be defined and repaired in the same operation [9]. Unresolved debate still exists regarding the benefit of using laparoscopy over conventional open inguinal hernia repair even among laparoscopic surgeons due to the concern about its higher recurrence rate [9].

Parameters such as operative time, blood loss, length of postoperative stay, the removal of accessory spleens and postoperative complications including postoperative high fever, acute chest syndrome (ACS), and ileus were pooled and compared by meta-analysis. Results: Among the 922 pediatric participants included in the 10 studies, 508 had received LS and 414 OS. There were shorter length of hospital stays, less blood loss, and longer operative times with the LS approach compared with OS.
