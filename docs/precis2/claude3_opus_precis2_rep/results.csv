Quotes: ""People with multiple sclerosis were screened on the General Health Questionnaire 12 and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, and those with low mood were recruited.""
""Four and eight months after random allocation, participants were sent a booklet of outcome questionnaires to complete and return by post.""
Reasoning: The trial used screening questionnaires (GHQ-12 and HADS) to identify eligible participants with multiple sclerosis and low mood. This represents a somewhat explanatory approach, as these specific screening tests may not be used in usual care to determine eligibility for psychological therapy. However, people with multiple sclerosis and low mood would be the appropriate population for this intervention in usual care.
Score: [3]

Recruitment:
Quotes: ""People with multiple sclerosis were screened on the General Health Questionnaire 12 and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, and those with low mood were recruited.""
Reasoning: Participants were recruited through screening using questionnaires. While this is a systematic approach, it's not clear if it required extra effort beyond what would be done in usual care to engage patients with multiple sclerosis for psychological therapy. More details would be needed to determine how pragmatic or explanatory the recruitment process was compared to usual care.
Score: [NA] 

Setting:
Quotes: ""The details of this study have been published elsewhere.3 However, in summary, participants were included who scored >2 on the General Health Questionnaire 12,7 a measure of psychological distress, or >7 on the anxiety and depression subscales""
Reasoning: The trial was conducted in a community setting, as participants were screened and recruited from the general population of people with multiple sclerosis. This represents a pragmatic approach, as it used a setting that appears very similar to where patients would be identified and treated in usual care.
Score: [5]

Organization:
Quotes: ""Participants randomly allocated to the adjustment group received six group treatment sessions. The control group received usual care, which did not include psychological interventions.""
""The groups were delivered by two Band 5 assistant psychologists, who were supervised by a Band 8a clinical psychologist, experienced in working with people with multiple sclerosis.""
Reasoning: The intervention was delivered by Band 5 assistant psychologists, supervised by an experienced Band 8a clinical psychologist. This likely represents an explanatory approach, as the level of expertise and supervision is probably greater than what would be routinely available in usual care to deliver this type of group psychological intervention.
Score: [2]

Flexibility (delivery):
Quotes: ""The intervention was targeted at mood, and the EQ-5D assesses other aspects of quality of life that would not be affected by the intervention.""
Reasoning: There are no details provided in the full text about flexibility of intervention delivery. It's not stated whether a strict protocol was followed or if the psychologists could adapt delivery based on circumstances. Insufficient information to assess how pragmatic or explanatory intervention delivery flexibility was compared to usual care.
Score: [NA]

Flexibility (adherence):
Quotes: ""If participants failed to return outcome questionnaires they were telephoned once to remind them.""
Reasoning: There was some flexibility in participant adherence, as they were telephoned once if they did not return questionnaires. However, it's not clear if this single reminder call represents a pragmatic approach similar to what would be done in usual care, or if it is an explanatory approach with extra efforts to ensure adherence. More information is needed to fully assess flexibility of adherence compared to usual care.

Follow-up:
Quotes: ""Four and eight months after random allocation, participants were sent a booklet of outcome questionnaires to complete and return by post. This booklet included the measures administered at baseline, the General Health Questionnaire 12 and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, and in addition the BDI-II,6 a measure of the severity of depression.""
Reasoning: Follow-up involved mailed questionnaires at 4 and 8 months, including the same baseline measures plus an additional depression severity measure (BDI-II). This likely represents a somewhat explanatory approach, as the follow-up is more extensive than what would typically be done in usual care, especially the addition of the BDI-II. However, the follow-up is not overly burdensome and the timing is not too far off from what might be reasonable for usual care.
Score: [3]

Primary outcome:
Quotes: ""The EQ-5D5 was included as a generic quality of life measure. To ascertain costs, a questionnaire was used to assess the use of NHS services and prescribed medication in the previous three months.""
Reasoning: The primary outcome measures were quality of life (EQ-5D) and costs/service use. These outcomes are relevant to participants and likely consistent with what would be collected in usual care. Using a generic QoL measure and assessing costs pragmatically from an NHS perspective suggests an approach similar to usual care evaluation of a psychological intervention.

""Four and eight months after random allocation, participants were sent a booklet of outcome questionnaires to complete and return by post.""
Reasoning: The primary analysis appears to have used all available data (71% of eligible patients were enrolled). The full text does not explicitly state that intention-to-treat analysis was done, but it seems data was collected and analyzed from all randomized participants who completed questionnaires, regardless of adherence to the intervention. This suggests a fairly pragmatic approach, although more details on handling of missing data would be needed to fully assess this domain.

Quotes: ""Data analyses were conducted using SPSS, version 24.0 for Windows (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Neuropsychological data were scored by the testers and verified by a second staff member. Data were entered and checked for accuracy. Internal consistency reliability coefficients for all self-report measures were .80 or above. Descriptive analyses were performed to obtain a profile of the sample. The groups were compared at baseline on demographic and disease variables. Preliminary analysis for assumptions of normality, independence of errors, homogeneity of variance, and outliers suggested that assumptions had generally been met and therefore data transformations were deemed unnecessary.""
Reasoning: The primary analysis appears to have used all available data, as the sample sizes remain consistent from baseline to follow-up (no mention of excluding participants). This represents an intent-to-treat approach that is more pragmatic. However, the trial did employ some explanatory-style data verification and checking procedures that differ from usual care.

Flexibility (delivery):
Quotes: ""Corticotrophin was reduced from 15 to 10 units daily and ampicillin was advised for the urinary infection. She was admitted to hospital on May 6, 1966, in bacteraemic shock; temperature 103°F (39-3°C), pulse-rate 120 per minute, blood-pressure 70/40 mm. Hg. Despite intravenous hydrocortisone and other therapy, intramuscular cortisone acetate, and chloromycetin she died the following day.""
Reasoning: The quote suggests there was some flexibility in the delivery of the intervention, with corticotrophin being reduced and other treatments advised/given. However, the full extent of flexibility in delivery is not clear from the limited information provided.

Follow-up:
Quotes: ""The treated group were given corticotrophin (' Acthar ' gel) in a dosage which varied between 15 and 25 units daily, potassium chloride orally, and a low-salt diet. The dose of corticotrophin was adjusted to produce just enough "" mooning "" of the face to be appreciated by the physician in charge of the trial and the dose was not increased during a relapse.""
Reasoning: The follow-up procedures involved physician assessment of side effects to guide dosing, which seems more intensive than usual care follow-up. However, the frequency and full nature of follow-up visits and data collection is not described in detail.
Score: [2] 

Primary outcome:
Quotes: ""Their evidence that long-term maintenance treatment continued for years is effective is less convincing, however.""
Reasoning: The primary outcomes appear to be deterioration and relapses over an 18 month period, which are clinically relevant to patients. However, the authors acknowledge the evidence for long-term effectiveness is not fully convincing.

Reasoning: The analysis only included 29 out of the planned number of patients, due to changes in usual care during the trial. This suggests a more explanatory approach, as a pragmatic trial would have aimed to maintain the planned sample size and analysis. However, the reason for the reduced sample size was due to external changes in usual care, not factors controlled by the trial.

Recruitment:
Quotes: ""After a group meeting where the details of the investigation were described to the patients, including possible risks and discomfort associated to the intervention, a formal invitation to take part in the study was offered.""
Reasoning: Holding a group meeting to describe the study and formally invite patients is more effort than would be used in usual care recruitment. However, patients were ultimately recruited from MS rehabilitation centers they were already attending, which is more pragmatic than recruitment from the general population.
Score: [3]

Setting:
Quotes: ""All participants were recruited among six MS rehabilitation centers within the region of Castilla y León (Spain).""
Reasoning: The trial was conducted in six real-world MS rehabilitation centers, which is identical to the usual care setting for this population.
Score: [5]

Organization:
Quotes: ""The study was approved by the Research Ethics Committee of the University of Leon.""
Reasoning: The trial required some additional approvals compared to usual care, but no other additional resources, staffing, or training are mentioned. The organization seems largely similar to usual care.
Score: [4]

Flexibility (delivery):
Quotes: ""The CG followed their habitual daily activities during the study period and they did not follow any kind of structured physical activity. Dependent variables included maximal voluntary isometric contraction (MVIC), maximal torque, average power and muscle endurance.""
Reasoning: The control group had no restrictions and followed their usual activities. The exercise group had a structured resistance training program, but details on flexibility of delivery are not provided. More information is needed to fully assess flexibility of delivery.
Score: [NA]

Flexibility (adherence):
Quotes: ""None of the patients had previous experience with resistance training.""
Reasoning: Patients' prior experience with resistance training was assessed, but no information is provided on any measures to improve or enforce adherence. There is insufficient information to assess flexibility of adherence.
Score: [NA]

Follow-up:
Quotes: ""Knee extension maximal voluntary isometric contraction (MVIC), muscle endurance and muscle power was evaluated before and after the 12 weeks after training completion. A strain gauge was used to measure the maximal voluntary isometric contraction and muscle power was assessed with a linear encoder. Muscle endurance was interpreted as the number of repetitions that a patient could perform in a single set of knee extension exercise.""
Reasoning: Outcome assessments were performed before and after the 12-week training period using specialized equipment like a strain gauge and linear encoder. This is more extensive data collection than would occur in usual care over this timeframe.
Score: [2]

Primary outcome:
Quotes: ""Average power test was also carried out in the knee extension machine described for the training program. Participants were evaluated during a single set to volitional exhaustion with a load corresponding to the 40% of the pre-training MVIC (De Souza-Teixeira, 2009). Subjects were requested to perform the concentric phase of every repetition with a ROM of ∼90–180 degrees, as fast as possible, and to lower the load (eccentric action; ∼180–90°) in a control manner.""
Reasoning: The primary outcome of average power during knee extension is likely relevant to MS patients' daily functioning. However, the assessment requires specialized equipment (knee extension machine) and procedures (single set to exhaustion at 40% pre-training MVIC) that would not be used in usual care.
Score: [3]

Primary analysis:
Quotes: ""All subjects taking part in the study (n = 42) completed all the scheduled testing protocols. Adherence to the training intervention (e.g. EG) averaged 92.9 ± 1.5 sessions from a total of 24 planned sessions. All participants from the EG completed more than 75% of the sessions included in the resistance training program.""
Reasoning: The analysis appears to include all randomized participants (n=42) who completed baseline and follow-up testing. This is consistent with an intent-to-treat approach.

Analysis of covariance was used, with treatment as a fixed effect and the baseline value as a covariate. A 95% confidence interval (CI) was derived for the adjusted difference between mean scores.""
""The post hoc per-protocol results approached but did not meet equivalence for the effect on the MiniAQLQ score at 2 months and 2 years (Table 2). ACQ scores did not differ significantly between the LTRA and inhaled-glucocorticoid groups (Table E17 in the Supplementary Appendix).""

The primary analysis was an intention-to-treat analysis using all randomized patients. A per-protocol analysis was also performed but as a post-hoc secondary analysis. This indicates a pragmatic approach to the primary analysis.

The primary outcomes of walking speed (T25FW) and complex walking (SSST) are performance measures that are highly relevant to MS patients. They were conducted according to standard protocols at the fastest safe speed. This reflects a pragmatic approach, as these outcomes have clear importance to participants. However, the SSST may not be widely used in usual care, making the outcome measures slightly more explanatory than fully pragmatic.

1. ""Participants were included from September 2016 to October 2018, after being invited via seven MS clinics (specified in ""Acknowledgements"" section) and targeted advertisements sent out via the Danish MS Society. The inclusion criteria were as follows: age > 18, confirmed diagnosis of MS, Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS): 2.0–6.5, Six Spot Step Test (SSST) score > 8 seconds or Timed 25-Foot Walk (T25FW) > 5 seconds, relapse-free within the past 8 weeks, and no adjustment of disease-modifying medication or medication that affects gait performance and spasticity within the past 8 weeks.""
2. ""Exclusion criteria were as follows: co-morbidity in terms of cognitive disorders or alcohol abuse (based on clinical judgment), pathologies that did not allow systematic PRT and BMCT and PRT lasting the last 3 months.""

The trial used a mix of pragmatic and explanatory eligibility criteria. Recruiting from MS clinics and the MS Society is fairly pragmatic. However, there were several exclusion criteria based on disease severity (EDSS score, SSST, T25FW), recent relapses, medication changes, comorbidities, and prior therapy that would not be applied in usual care. Overall, the eligibility criteria were more explanatory than pragmatic.

2. ""The BMCT intervention consisted of 20 1-hour training sessions over 10 weeks (two sessions/ week). All sessions started with a 10-minute warm-up on a stationary bicycle or treadmill.""

The organization of the BMCT intervention involved specialized physiotherapists and a regimented schedule of 20 1-hour sessions over 10 weeks, which differs from the flexibility of usual care. However, the sessions were delivered at usual physiotherapy clinics. This represents a mix of pragmatic and explanatory elements in the trial's organization.

Quotes:
1. ""The exercises were conducted in machines that targeted the specified muscle groups, but type of machines could vary between centers. All training sessions were supervised by physiotherapists who were trained to deliver the intervention.""
2. ""The BMCT intervention consisted of 20 1-hour training sessions over 10 weeks (two sessions/ week). All sessions started with a 10-minute warm-up on a stationary bicycle or treadmill.""

The BMCT intervention followed a strict protocol of supervised 1-hour sessions twice per week for 10 weeks, always starting with a 10-minute warmup. While there was some flexibility in the type of exercise machines used between centers, overall the delivery of the intervention was tightly controlled, making it very explanatory.

Reasoning: Safety assessments were conducted at in-person clinic visits at screening, Months 1, 3 and 6. This follow-up schedule is somewhat more frequent than typical usual care for RRMS patients, but not as intensive as an explanatory trial. The 6-month duration is also fairly typical for assessing RRMS therapies. Inclusion of early discontinuation and time to withdrawal analyses suggests a more pragmatic approach to follow-up.

Primary analysis:
Quotes: ""The intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis set included all randomly assigned patients and were analyzed according to the treatment group to which they were randomly assigned, regardless of which treatment they actually received.""
Reasoning: The primary analysis was conducted using an intention-to-treat approach including all randomized patients according to their assigned groups. This pragmatic strategy matches how effectiveness would be assessed in real-world practice, in contrast to an explanatory per-protocol analysis including only fully adherent patients. Missing data and early discontinuations do not appear to have been excluded.
Score: [5]","Eligibility:
Quotes: ""Key inclusion criteria permitted the participation of men or women ≥18 years of age with confirmed and documented RRMS diagnosis (as defined by the Revised McDonald criteria) (Polman et al., 2011), Kurtzke Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score of 0 to 5.5 at the screening visit, and, 30 days prior to randomization, a stable neurological condition, relapse-free status, and no use of any corticosteroid or adrenocorticotropic hormone treatment.""
Reasoning: The eligibility criteria are somewhat stricter than what would be used in usual care for RRMS patients. The age cutoff of 18 years is reasonable, but the EDSS score restriction to 0-5.5 and requirements of stable neurological condition, relapse-free status, and no recent steroid use are more stringent than usual care. However, the criteria are not extremely narrow either.

Recruitment:
Quotes: No relevant quotes identified regarding recruitment methods.
Reasoning: The full text does not provide any details on the recruitment methods used in this trial and how they compare to usual care. There is insufficient information to assess how pragmatic or explanatory the recruitment was.

Setting:
Quotes: ""The CONFIDENCE study was a multinational, multicenter, randomized, parallel-group, phase 4, open-label study conducted at 88 study centers in 14 countries (Russia, Poland, Italy, France, Croatia, US [including Puerto Rico], Mexico, Spain, Austria, Turkey, Belgium, Argentina, Germany, and Finland) across different geographic regions.""
Reasoning: The trial was conducted at 88 centers across 14 countries in varied geographic regions. This is a relatively diverse and real-world range of settings, more pragmatic than a single-center or single-country explanatory trial. However, it's not clear if all the centers were typical community practices or if some were specialized academic centers.

Flexibility (delivery):
Quotes: ""Patients' adherence to treatment measured at Months 1, 3, and 6 using the MS-TAQ questionnaire showed consistently greater adherence to treatment in patients receiving GA40 compared with those receiving GA20 (Fig. 5). RM ANOVA analyses of MS-TAQ total scores during the 6-month treatment period showed significantly lower MS-TAQ scores in patients treated with GA40 than with GA20 during that time, indicating higher adherence to GA40 versus GA20 (table e-4).""
Reasoning: The trial assessed adherence using a questionnaire at multiple timepoints, indicating some flexibility in intervention delivery to accommodate differences in adherence between the GA40 and GA20 groups. However, the degree of flexibility in the protocol is not explicitly stated. The text suggests flexibility more similar to usual care than a highly rigid explanatory trial.

Flexibility (adherence):
Quotes: ""Patients withdrawn (n=32) Death (n=1) Adverse event (n=14) Withdrawal by patient (n=10) Protocol violation (n=1) Lost to follow-up (n=2) Other (n=4)""
Reasoning: The patient disposition shows that 10 patients withdrew from the trial and 1 was lost to follow-up, suggesting that patient adherence to the intervention was not strictly enforced as it would be in an explanatory trial. Patients were allowed to withdraw for various reasons. However, the full flexibility of adherence compared to usual care is not clearly described.
Score: [4]

Follow-up:
Quotes: ""Safety assessments were recorded in clinic visits and included adverse events (AEs) throughout the study, vital sign measurements, concomitant medication usage, and clinical laboratory test results at screening and Months 1, 3, and 6. Safety variables monitored also included the percentage of early treatment discontinuation patients who prematurely discontinued from the study due to AEs, as well as the time to withdrawal.""
Reasoning: Safety assessments were conducted at in-person clinic visits at screening, Months 1, 3 and 6. This follow-up schedule is somewhat more frequent than typical usual care for RRMS patients, but not as intensive as an explanatory trial. The 6-month duration is also fairly typical for assessing RRMS therapies. Inclusion of early discontinuation and time to withdrawal analyses suggests a more pragmatic approach to follow-up.

Follow-up:
Quotes: ""The MSSE survey was originally developed and validated by Schwartz et al. (1996), based on the work of Lorig et al. (1989), who created a similar tool for use with people suffering from arthritis.""
Reasoning: A validated self-efficacy survey was used to assess outcomes. The survey appears to be one that could feasibly be used in usual care follow-up for this population. No additional follow-up visits or assessments beyond what would be typical in usual care were described.
Score: [4]

Primary outcome:
Quotes: ""The outcome measures for the current research were the scores yielded by the Multiple Sclerosis Self Efficacy (MSSE) survey. For both treatment and control groups, self efficacy scores were obtained before the first treatment, mid-treatment series, after the last treatment in the series, four weeks after the final treatment and again eight weeks after the final treatment had been received.""
Reasoning: Self-efficacy, assessed using a validated survey at multiple relevant timepoints, is an outcome that is likely to be important to multiple sclerosis patients. The outcome and its measurement appear consistent with what could be collected in usual care.
Score: [5]

Primary analysis:
Quotes: ""The data were analyzed on an intention to treat basis, with a focus on the differences between mean MSSE values of the control and intervention groups. Inferential comparison of scores was conducted using independent t-tests at five measurement points: baseline, mid-intervention, post-intervention, mid follow up and final follow up.""
Reasoning: The primary analysis was conducted on an intent-to-treat basis, including all participants. This matches the typically pragmatic approach of including all available data in the primary analysis.

Only patients with baseline EDSS ≥2.0 were included in the analysis of CDI; 154 (alemtuzumab, n = 105; subcutaneous interferon-β-1a [SC IFN-β-1a], n = 49) patients were excluded from the analysis for not meeting this criterion.""
The primary analysis used Kaplan-Meier estimates of the risk of achieving 6-month confirmed disability improvement (CDI). Patients with baseline EDSS <2.0 were excluded. While not a fully intention-to-treat approach, the analysis included most randomized patients and estimated a pragmatic outcome. Some exclusions were made for patients with lower baseline disability.

Quotes: ""CDT is a social cognitive theory-based intervention aiming to uncover and promote existing capabilities, with the notion 'stressor' as central concept [9]. CDT is based on the identification and reduction of stressors, client-centred group sessions and the use of another significant informal caregiver group sessions; and self-reliance, autonomy and acceptance as central themes [9]. CDT focuses on the exploration of those stressors that confine patients to their physical, psychological or social roles regarding their disease and limitations; reduces relevant stressors; explores and pushes personal boundaries by making optimal use of the existing potential [9].""

The intervention has a structured protocol based on social cognitive theory principles. While some tailoring to the individual is mentioned, such as identifying personal stressors and boundaries, overall the delivery appears to be fairly standardized without much flexibility. No discussion of allowed co-interventions or management of complications.

Flexibility (adherence):
Quotes: ""All participants were contacted every two weeks during the first two months, then monthly thereafter by the exercise instructor by telephone or email for follow-up by the instructor. The purpose of follow-up contacts is to provide an opportunity to ask any questions they have and also to facilitate long-term retention in the study.""
Participants received regular follow-up contacts from the exercise instructor to encourage adherence and retention. However, there is no mention of any measures taken to strictly enforce or monitor adherence.

Follow-up:
Quotes: ""The intention was to follow participants for the first year of the intervention when the exercise programme was designed and adjusted as needed and have a further follow-up after the second year.""
The follow-up extended to 2 years after the start of the intervention, which is longer than typical in usual care. The assessments also involved four visits over the first year which is more frequent than standard care.
Score: [2]

Primary outcome:
Quotes: ""Primary outcome was peak oxygen consumption (VO2peak) at 12 months; secondary outcomes were composite measures of physical function, fatigue, and health-related quality of life.""
Peak oxygen consumption is a physiological measure that requires specific testing not used in usual care. The other outcomes of physical function, fatigue and quality of life are more relevant to participants.

Primary analysis:
Quotes: ""A mixed effects model for VO2peak (continuous variable); interaction group × time non-significant, main effects only presented. The group effect is interpreted as the difference between groups averaged over time; as the 95% CI included the null value of 0, the group effect was non-significant.""
The primary analysis used a mixed effects model including all participants. There is no mention of excluding any participants post-randomization. This suggests an intent-to-treat approach was used.

""Ethical approval was received from the West of Scotland Research Ethics Service (ref: 12/WS/0147) and participants were recruited from the Multiple Sclerosis Service, at the Douglas Grant Rehabilitation Centre, Irvine, Scotland.""
Reasoning: The trial recruited participants from a Multiple Sclerosis Service at a rehabilitation center. While this represents the type of patients that would receive the intervention in usual care, there were some restrictions on eligibility like EDSS score 5-6.5. This makes the eligibility criteria somewhat more restrictive than what would be used in usual care.

Recruitment:
Quotes: ""Ethical approval was received from the West of Scotland Research Ethics Service (ref: 12/WS/0147) and participants were recruited from the Multiple Sclerosis Service, at the Douglas Grant Rehabilitation Centre, Irvine, Scotland.""
Reasoning: Participants were recruited from a Multiple Sclerosis service at a rehabilitation center they were already attending. This seems to align with how recruitment would occur in usual care, without extra efforts to recruit participants.
Score: [5]

Setting:
Quotes: ""A randomized controlled pilot study. Setting: Rehabilitation centre and participants' homes.""
Reasoning: The intervention was delivered via a website that participants accessed from their homes. This matches the setting of usual care for a web-based physiotherapy intervention. The rehabilitation center was only used for recruitment and some assessments.
Score: [5]  

Organization:
Quotes: ""The website, which was used to deliver the intervention, was developed in collaboration with a patient steering group and incorporating recommendations from the MS Society accessibility policy and advice from the British Accessibility Information Forum.""
""Individualised therapeutic exercise programmes were developed for participants in Group 1, with exercises selected based on their baseline assessment and personal goals.""
Reasoning: The web-based physiotherapy intervention required some additional organization compared to usual care, including developing individualized exercise programs for each participant and creating a website in collaboration with patient groups. However, once implemented, the delivery of the intervention did not require extra staff or resources beyond what would be available in usual care.
Score: [3]

Flexibility (delivery):
Quotes: ""Participants were given unique log-in details to view their own, online personalised exercise programme. This was a pragmatic study with the content of the web-based programme being similar to the content if it had been delivered face-to-face.""
""Participants were advised to undertake the exercise programme a minimum of twice a week and to complete their online exercise diary which was seen remotely by the physiotherapist.""
Reasoning: The intervention allowed some flexibility in how it was delivered, with participants accessing their personalized exercise program online on their own schedule at least twice a week. This is similar to the flexibility that would be allowed in usual care. However, participants were remotely monitored by the physiotherapist to discuss progress and update programs as appropriate.
Score: [4]

Flexibility (adherence):
Quotes: ""Participants were advised to undertake the exercise programme a minimum of twice a week and to complete their online exercise diary which was seen remotely by the physiotherapist.""
Reasoning: Participants were advised to complete their exercise program at least twice a week, but no strict measures were taken to improve or enforce adherence. Adherence was monitored remotely by the physiotherapist viewing exercise diaries. This represents flexibility in adherence similar to what would be expected in usual care.
Score: [4]

Follow-up:
Quotes: ""Outcome measures were recorded at baseline and at the end of the intervention period (week 13). The primary outcome measure, the timed 25 foot walk, has good reliability and validity in the MS population.""

Follow-up:
Quotes: 
""A blind examiner assessed dyads at baseline, 3 months, and 6 months.""
""0 dyads were lost to follow-up; 4 dyads discontinued intervention; - 3 patients died (one after 12-week visit); - 1 withdrew consent (before 12-week visit); 1 dyad did not perform visit 3""
Reasoning: Dyads were assessed at baseline, 3 months and 6 months, with few participants lost to follow-up and some discontinuing the intervention. This represents a moderately intensive follow-up schedule. However, without knowing the typical follow-up in usual care, it is difficult to determine if this is more or less intensive than usual.

Primary outcome:
Quotes:
""Primary outcome measures were Palliative care Outcome Scale-Symptoms-MS (POS-S-MS) and Schedule for the Evaluation of Individual Quality of Life-Direct Weighting (SEIQoL-DW, not assessed in severely cognitively compromised patients).""
""Mean change in POS-S-MS score from baseline to 3 months was 1.1 (95% confidence interval (CI), −0.5 to 2.7) in the HPA group and −0.2 (95% CI, −2.9 to 2.6) in the UC group, with a mean between-group difference of 1.3 (95% CI, −1.7 to 4.2), and a Cohen's d effect size (ES) of 0.20.""
Reasoning: The primary outcomes of POS-S-MS and SEIQoL-DW appear to be relevant to participants, as they measure palliative care symptoms and quality of life. The outcomes are patient-reported and do not seem to require assessment expertise unavailable in usual care. The timing of outcome assessment is not clearly compared to usual care.
Score: [4]

Primary analysis:
Quotes:
""50 dyads were analyzed; 2 dyads were excluded from analysis; - 2 did not receive allocated intervention""
Reasoning: 50 out of the 52 randomized dyads were included in the primary analysis. The 2 excluded dyads did not receive the allocated intervention, so this is not a strict intention-to-treat approach. However, the analysis still included a high proportion of the randomized participants.

Quotes: ""Primary endpoint was the change in the BBS (Berg Balance Scale) (0–13 (difference from BBS baseline to week 12). Secondary endpoints were changes from baseline in fatigue (Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS)),14,15 health-related quality of life (Multiple Sclerosis Quality of Life-54 (MSQoL-54)),16 pain (Visual Analogue Scale (VAS)),17,18 and spasticity (Numeric Rating Scale (NRS)).""
Reasoning: The primary outcome of Berg Balance Scale is a clinically relevant measure that would be used to assess the effectiveness of hippotherapy in usual care. The secondary outcomes of fatigue, quality of life, pain and spasticity are also patient-relevant. The outcomes do not appear to require any central adjudication or special assessment not part of usual care.
Score: [5]

Primary analysis:
Quotes: ""Analyses were based on the modified intention-to-treat set (modified ITT). This set encompasses all randomized patients with valid baseline assessment. The primary endpoint change of BBS from baseline to 12 weeks was calculated using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) with the fixed effects group, center, age, gender, EDSS classification, and baseline BBS (type 2 sums of squares). Missing values were imputed through the last observation carried forward (LOCF) value.""
Reasoning: The primary analysis was conducted on a modified intention-to-treat population that excluded patients without a valid baseline assessment. Missing data was imputed using last observation carried forward. This approach is more explanatory than a full intention-to-treat analysis using all randomized patients. However, only a small number of patients were excluded.
Score: [3]","Eligibility:
Quotes: ""MS patients older than 18 years who had a confirmed MS with spasticity of the lower limbs and an Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS)9 score between 4 and 6.5 were eligible for inclusion. Patients who had received hippotherapy within the last 12 months, a body weight over 90 kg, no balance while sitting, and acute exacerbation during the 4-week period before start of the therapy were excluded.""
Reasoning: The trial had some exclusion criteria like EDSS score range, recent hippotherapy, high body weight, poor balance, and recent exacerbation that differ from the typical MS population receiving hippotherapy in usual care. However, the core eligibility criteria of confirmed MS with lower limb spasticity are similar to the usual care population.
Score: [3]

Recruitment:
Quotes: No relevant quotes identified.
Reasoning: The full text does not provide any details on the recruitment process and how it compares to recruitment for hippotherapy in usual care. There is insufficient information to assess how pragmatic or explanatory the recruitment was.
Score: [NA] 

Setting:
Quotes: ""MS-HIPPO was a prospective, randomized, examiner-blinded, multicenter, comparative trial with an allocation of 1:1 to the two groups: hippotherapy plus standard care compared to standard care alone (as prior to the study). The intervention lasted for 12 weeks.""
Reasoning: The trial was conducted at multiple centers, which is more reflective of usual care than a single center trial. However, no details are provided on the types of centers and how they compare to typical hippotherapy settings. The information is limited but suggests the setting had some pragmatic elements.
Score: [4]

Organization:
Quotes: ""Hippotherapy plus standard care, while below the threshold of a minimal clinically important difference, significantly improved balance and also fatigue, spasticity, and quality of life in MS patients.""
Reasoning: The intervention group received hippotherapy plus standard care, which appears to match the typical organization of care for hippotherapy in MS patients. The control group continuing their prior therapy also reflects usual care. No details are provided about any extra organizational resources or training required for the trial.
Score: [4]

Flexibility (delivery):
Quotes: ""Hippotherapy as a complementary treatment can be defined as one-patient-one-horse physiotherapy treatment with influence on muscle tone (reduction in spasticity) and breathing, strengthening the torso muscles, improving balance control and coordination, as well as gait. In addition, hippotherapy promotes social communication in the patients' lives and strengthens their self-esteem.""
Reasoning: The description of the hippotherapy intervention is quite general, mentioning its effects on multiple outcomes. No details are provided about a specific intervention protocol or measures to ensure compliance. This suggests the delivery of hippotherapy was flexible and similar to usual care.
Score: [4]

Flexibility (adherence):
Quotes: No relevant quotes identified. 
Reasoning: The full text does not discuss any measures to monitor or enforce patient adherence to the hippotherapy sessions. No details are provided about patients being withdrawn for non-adherence. The lack of information suggests adherence flexibility was likely similar to usual care.
Score: [4]

Follow-up:
Quotes: ""Examinations and questionnaires were completed prior to the first hippotherapy session (baseline), after 6–7 weeks (interim assessment) and after 12 weeks (final assessment). Physiotherapists who assessed the endpoints in a separate room were blinded and explicitly trained not to question patients or hippotherapists.""
Reasoning: Assessments were conducted at baseline, 6-7 weeks and 12 weeks. This schedule involves more frequent follow-up than would be typical for hippotherapy in usual care. The use of blinded assessors also makes the follow-up more explanatory than usual care.

Quotes: ""Guidelines were provided to physiotherapists and participants for exercises to be adapted and progressed to an individual functional ability via increasing repetitions, amplitude of movement, speed of movement, and modifying base of support.""
While some flexibility in exercise progression was allowed based on individual ability, the delivery still followed a defined protocol of 2 sessions per week for 8 weeks with specific exercise guidelines. This is likely less flexible than what would occur in usual care.
Score: [3]

Flexibility (adherence):
Quotes: ""Participants in both groups were encouraged to work at a pace at which they could rest if they felt fatigue, or had a perceived exertion of greater than 7/10 on the modified Borg scale.""
Participants were encouraged to maintain their usual activity levels outside of the intervention sessions. They had some flexibility to rest if fatigued. However, the intervention still required them to adhere to two 60-min sessions per week.

Follow-up:
Quotes: ""Fifty people with MS were randomized and completed baseline assessment; 47 completed post-assessment and 44 follow-up assessment.""
Two follow-up assessments were conducted - immediately post-intervention at 8 weeks, and at 16 weeks. This is more extensive than typical follow-up that would occur as part of usual care for an exercise intervention.

Patients were recruited from asthma registers at the participating general practices. This appears to be a pragmatic approach using the usual patient population at these practices, without extra effort to recruit. However, restricting to only those due for an annual review and excluding COPD patients is a bit more explanatory.

However, a significant number of screened patients (55%) were excluded for reasons such as having comorbidities precluding surgery, which may decrease generalizability to some extent.

Quotes: ""To evaluate the clinical effectiveness of surgical vs nonsurgical treatment for adults with displaced fractures of the proximal humerus involving the surgical neck.""
""A pragmatic, multicenter, parallel-group, randomized clinical trial, the Proximal Fracture of the Humerus Evaluation by Randomization (PROFHER) trial, recruited 250 patients aged 16 years or older (mean age, 66 years [range, 24-92 years]; 192 [77%] were female; and 249 [99.6%] were white) who presented at the orthopedic departments of 32 acute UK National Health Service hospitals between September 2008 and April 2011 within 3 weeks after sustaining a displaced fracture of the proximal humerus involving the surgical neck.""
Reasoning: The eligibility criteria are quite broad, including adults aged 16 years or older who sustained a displaced proximal humerus fracture involving the surgical neck within 3 weeks. The mean age of 66 years with a wide range of 24-92 years, and the inclusion of 32 hospitals, suggests the study population is fairly representative of the typical patient population for this condition. However, nearly all participants being white may somewhat limit generalizability.
Score: [4]

Recruitment:
Quotes: ""Patients were followed up for 2 years (up to April 2013) and 215 had complete follow-up data.""
Reasoning: The full text does not provide details on the recruitment process, such as whether participants were recruited during usual care visits or through other means. The high follow-up rate of 215 out of 250 patients (86%) at 2 years suggests recruitment was likely done in a pragmatic way integrated with usual care, but there is insufficient information to determine how explanatory or pragmatic the recruitment was.

Reasoning: The trial was conducted at 32 orthopedic departments of acute UK National Health Service hospitals. This represents the typical setting in which patients with proximal humerus fractures are treated in the UK healthcare system and is likely very similar to usual care.
Score: [5]

Organization:
Quotes: ""Standardized outpatient and community-based rehabilitation was provided to both groups.""
""Fracture fixation or humeral head replacement were performed by surgeons experienced in these techniques. Nonsurgical treatment was sling immobilization. Standardized outpatient and community-based rehabilitation was provided to both groups.""
Reasoning: Both surgical and nonsurgical groups received standardized rehabilitation in outpatient and community settings, which appears to be similar to usual care. The surgical procedures were performed by experienced surgeons, which is likely typical in usual care. No additional details are provided about the healthcare providers or resources used in the trial compared to usual care.
Score: [4]

Flexibility (delivery):
Quotes: ""Fracture fixation or humeral head replacement were performed by surgeons experienced in these techniques. Nonsurgical treatment was sling immobilization.""
Reasoning: The delivery of the surgical and nonsurgical interventions appears to have been flexible and at the discretion of the treating surgeons, similar to usual care. Surgeons could choose between fracture fixation or humeral head replacement based on their experience. Nonsurgical treatment was simply sling immobilization. No strict protocols or monitoring procedures are mentioned.
Score: [5]  

Flexibility (adherence):
Quotes: No relevant quotes identified.
Reasoning: The study interventions were a one-time surgery or sling immobilization. Participant adherence is not relevant, as they do not need to adhere to the interventions after the initial treatment.
Score: [NA]

Follow-up:
Quotes: ""Patients were followed up at 6, 12, and 24 months. Sample size was based on a minimal clinically important difference of 5 points for the Oxford Shoulder Score.""
Reasoning: Patients were followed up at 6, 12 and 24 months, with the primary outcome assessed at 6 and 12 months. This represents a fairly long-term follow-up that is likely more intensive than usual care for this condition. However, the follow-up does not appear to be overly burdensome, with just 3 assessments over 2 years.
Score: [3]

Primary outcome:
Quotes: ""The primary outcome was the Oxford Shoulder Score (OSS), which is a shoulder-specific outcome measure validated in a UK population.12 The OSS provides a total score based on the patient's subjective assessment of pain and function. It contains 12 items, each with 5 categories of response, and a range of total scores of 0 (worst outcome) to 48 (best outcome).13 The OSS was collected by postal questionnaires at 6, 12, and 24 months.""
Reasoning: The primary outcome, the Oxford Shoulder Score, is a validated patient-reported outcome measure assessing shoulder pain and function. It is collected via postal questionnaires and directly measures outcomes relevant to patients. This appears to be a pragmatic outcome choice. However, the OSS may not be used routinely in usual care, so it is not entirely pragmatic.

""Of 1250 patients screened, 563 (45%) were eligible and 687 (55%) were ineligible (Figure 1). The most common reason for exclusion (>1 reason per patient possible) was that a patient had comorbidities that precluded surgery or anesthetic.""

2. ""Patients were excluded if they: • had experienced ≥3 falls in the previous year; • had unstable clinical conditions; • would be unable to follow instructions about exercise safely; or • were receiving palliative care.""

The trial recruited participants from primary care practices with some exclusion criteria, such as those with ≥3 falls in the previous year, unstable clinical conditions, inability to follow exercise instructions safely, or receiving palliative care. However, the inclusion criteria were relatively broad, including those aged ≥65 years who were community-dwelling, independently mobile, and physically able to do group exercise. This represents a moderately pragmatic approach, as the participants are generally representative of older primary care patients, with some reasonable exclusions.
