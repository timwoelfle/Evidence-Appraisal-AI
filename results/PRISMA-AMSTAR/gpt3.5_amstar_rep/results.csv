'A priori' methods of assessment should be provided (e.g., for effectiveness studies if the author(s) chose to include only randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled studies, or allocation concealment as inclusion criteria); for other types of studies alternative items will be relevant. Note: Can include use of a quality scoring tool or checklist, e.g., Jadad scale, risk of bias, sensitivity analysis, etc., or a description of quality items, with some kind of result for EACH study (“low” or “high” is fine, as long as it is clear which studies scored “low” and which scored “high”; a summary score/range for all studies is not acceptable).

- ""Our methodological assessment revealed that the studies ranged from poor to moderate quality.""

[Yes] The text states that a methodological assessment was performed and that the studies ranged from poor to moderate quality.

A8. Was the scientific quality of the included studies used appropriately in formulating conclusions? The results of the methodological rigor and scientific quality should be considered in the analysis and the conclusions of the review, and explicitly stated in formulating recommendations.

[Yes] The text states that the results of the methodological rigor and scientific quality were considered in formulating the conclusion that both approaches are acceptable.

A9. Were the methods used to combine the findings of studies appropriate? For the pooled results, a test should be done to ensure the studies were combinable, to assess their homogeneity (i.e., Chi-squared test for homogeneity, I2 ). If heterogeneity exists a random effects model should be used and/or the clinical appropriateness of combining should be taken into consideration (i.e., is it sensible to combine?). Note: Indicate “yes” if they mention or describe heterogeneity, i.e., if they explain that they cannot pool because of heterogeneity/variability between interventions.

An assessment of publication bias should include a combination of graphical aids (e.g., funnel plot, other available tests) and/or statistical tests (e.g., Egger regression test, Hedges-Olken). Note: If no test values or funnel plot included, score “no”. Score “yes” if mentions that publication bias could not be assessed because there were fewer than 10 included studies.

- The text does not mention any assessment of publication bias.

[NA] The text does not provide enough information to determine if the likelihood of publication bias was assessed.

- ""Conflict of Interest: None""

[Yes] The text clearly states that there is no conflict of interest.

Overall, the methodological quality of the systematic review is moderate. The review provided an a priori design, conducted a comprehensive literature search, provided the characteristics of the included studies, assessed the scientific quality of the included studies, used the scientific quality appropriately in formulating conclusions, and stated the absence of conflict of interest.

[NA] The text does not provide enough information to determine if the status of publication was used as an inclusion criterion.

A5. Was a list of studies (included and excluded) provided? A list of included and excluded studies should be provided. Note: Acceptable if the excluded studies are referenced. If there is an electronic link to the list but the link is dead, select “no.”

- The text does not mention whether a list of included and excluded studies was provided.

[NA] The text does not provide enough information to determine if a list of included and excluded studies was provided.

A6. Were the characteristics of the included studies provided? In an aggregated form such as a table, data from the original studies should be provided on the participants, interventions and outcomes. The ranges of characteristics in all the studies analyzed e.g., age, race, sex, relevant socioeconomic data, disease status, duration, severity, or other diseases should be reported.

- ""The overall numbers of study subjects managed in these publications were 71 infants, ranging from 1 to 60 newborns with long-gap EA per study. All infants had long-gap EA without TEF. Data about the initial gap length were reported in all studies with a mean of 5.4 cm (range 3–12.5 cm). No study reported data about the preoperative gap length. The time until an anastomosis could be achieved was reported in all studies with a mean of 14 ± 8.2 days. The follow-up time was 5 years (range 0.2–10 years).""

[Yes] The text provides the characteristics of the included studies, including the number of study subjects, the initial gap length, the time until anastomosis, and the follow-up time.

A7. Was the scientific quality of the included studies assessed and documented? 'A priori' methods of assessment should be provided (e.g., for effectiveness studies if the author(s) chose to include only randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled studies, or allocation concealment as inclusion criteria); for other types of studies alternative items will be relevant. Note: Can include use of a quality scoring tool or checklist, e.g., Jadad scale, risk of bias, sensitivity analysis, etc., or a description of quality items, with some kind of result for EACH study (“low” or “high” is fine, as long as it is clear which studies scored “low” and which scored “high”; a summary score/range for all studies is not acceptable).

- ""Our methodological assessment revealed that the studies ranged from poor to moderate quality.""

[Yes] The text states that a methodological assessment was performed and that the studies ranged from poor to moderate quality.

A8. Was the scientific quality of the included studies used appropriately in formulating conclusions? The results of the methodological rigor and scientific quality should be considered in the analysis and the conclusions of the review, and explicitly stated in formulating recommendations. Note: Might say something such as “the results should be interpreted with caution due to poor quality of included studies.” Cannot score “yes” for this question if scored “no” for question A7.

- ""The results of this review fail to provide overwhelming support to either approach, and based on our analysis both approaches must be deemed to be acceptable.""

[Yes] The text states that the results of the methodological rigor and scientific quality were considered in formulating the conclusion that both approaches are acceptable.

A9. Were the methods used to combine the findings of studies appropriate? For the pooled results, a test should be done to ensure the studies were combinable, to assess their homogeneity (i.e., Chi-squared test for homogeneity, I2 ). If heterogeneity exists a random effects model should be used and/or the clinical appropriateness of combining should be taken into consideration (i.e., is it sensible to combine?). Note: Indicate “yes” if they mention or describe heterogeneity, i.e., if they explain that they cannot pool because of heterogeneity/variability between interventions.

- The text does not mention any methods used to combine the findings of studies.

[NA] The text does not provide enough information to determine if the methods used to combine the findings of studies were appropriate.

A10. Was the likelihood of publication bias assessed? An assessment of publication bias should include a combination of graphical aids (e.g., funnel plot, other available tests) and/or statistical tests (e.g., Egger regression test, Hedges-Olken). Note: If no test values or funnel plot included, score “no”. Score “yes” if mentions that publication bias could not be assessed because there were fewer than 10 included studies.

- The text does not mention any assessment of publication bias.

[NA] The text does not provide enough information to determine if the likelihood of publication bias was assessed.

A11. Was the conflict of interest included? Potential sources of support should be clearly acknowledged in both the systematic review and the included studies. Note: To get a “yes,” must indicate source of funding or support for the systematic review AND for each of the included studies.

- ""Conflict of Interest: None""

[Yes] The text clearly states that there is no conflict of interest.

Overall, the methodological quality of the systematic review is moderate. The review provided an a priori design, conducted a comprehensive literature search, provided the characteristics of the included studies, assessed the scientific quality of the included studies, used the scientific quality appropriately in formulating conclusions, and stated the absence of conflict of interest. However, the review did not mention duplicate study selection and data extraction, the status of publication as an inclusion criterion, a list of included and excluded studies, the methods used to combine the findings of studies, the assessment of publication bias, or any conflicts of interest in the included studies."

- ""We conducted a systematic review of literature focusing on the surgical treatment of IAT, including quality assessment of each study."" 
- ""We used a Dephi-like method [16] to determine the issues of greatest concern to pediatric surgeons regarding the surgical management of cryptorchid testes.""
- ""We sent an online survey to 34 experts with proficiency in this area, identified primarily on the basis of a literature search.""
- ""We developed a questionnaire listing all the issues raised by the experts in the first round.""
- ""We conducted electronic searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CINAHL from inception to September 2014.""
- ""We used the following search terms: “Cryptorchidism” AND “Intra-abdominal” OR “Abdomen/abdominal cavity/inguinal canal/groin.”""
- ""We included all studies that examined diagnostic and surgical correction techniques for IAT, even if this was not the primary focus of the study.""
- ""Our outcomes of interest were success of orchiopexy (testis viable and located in the scrotum), testicular atrophy, and intra-operative and post-operative complications.""
- ""Article screening took place in two stages—title and abstract, and full-text screening—both of which were conducted independently by two reviewers, followed by a consensus process.""
- ""We used AMSTAR [18] to assess the quality of all relevant systematic reviews (SRs).""
- ""Had we identified any randomized controlled trials (RCTs), we would have used the Cochrane ‘Risk of bias’ tool [19] to assess their quality.""
- ""We used MINORS [20] to assess the quality of all relevant non-randomized studies (comparative or non-comparative).""
- ""Two reviewers independently assessed each included study and compared the scores for each item on the applicable quality assessment tool to reach a consensus.""

Reasoning: The authors clearly describe the methods used to conduct the systematic review, including the search strategy, study selection process, and quality assessment tools used. They also mention using a Delphi-like method to determine the research question and issues of concern to pediatric surgeons. Therefore, an 'a priori' design was provided.
Answer: [Yes]

A2. Was there duplicate study selection and data extraction?
- ""Article screening took place in two stages—title and abstract, and full-text screening—both of which were conducted independently by two reviewers, followed by a consensus process.""
- ""Two reviewers independently assessed each included study and compared the scores for each item on the applicable quality assessment tool to reach a consensus.""

Reasoning: The study selection and data extraction processes were conducted independently by two reviewers, followed by a consensus process. Therefore, there was duplicate study selection and data extraction.
Answer: [Yes]

A3. Was a comprehensive literature search performed?
- ""We conducted electronic searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CINAHL from inception to September 2014.""
- ""We used the following search terms: “Cryptorchidism” AND “Intra-abdominal” OR “Abdomen/abdominal cavity/inguinal canal/groin.”""
- ""We also hand-searched the reference sections of included articles for additional relevant studies.""

Reasoning: The authors conducted a comprehensive literature search by searching multiple databases and hand-searching reference lists. They also provide details of the search terms used. Therefore, a comprehensive literature search was performed.
Answer: [Yes]

A4. Was the status of publication (i.e. grey literature) used as an inclusion criterion?
- No relevant quotes.

Reasoning: The text does not mention whether the status of publication was used as an inclusion criterion. Therefore, it is not clear if the authors searched for grey literature or unpublished literature.
Answer: [NA]

A5. Was a list of studies (included and excluded) provided?
- ""We performed full-text screening for these articles, excluding 17 that did not meet our criteria [7, 10, 22–36]. The remaining 31 studies comprised two SRs and 29 non-randomized studies; we quality assessed and summarized these studies (Table 1).""

Reasoning: The authors mention that they performed full-text screening and excluded 17 studies that did not meet their criteria. They also provide a summary table of the included studies. However, they do not explicitly state whether a list of excluded studies was provided. Therefore, it is unclear if a list of excluded studies was provided.
Answer: [No]

A6. Were the characteristics of the included studies provided?
- ""We quality assessed and summarized these studies (Table 1).""

Reasoning: The authors mention that they quality assessed and summarized the included studies, but they do not provide specific details about the characteristics of the included studies. Therefore, it is unclear if the characteristics of the included studies were provided.
Answer: [No]

A7. Was the scientific quality of the included studies assessed and documented?
- ""We used AMSTAR [18] to assess the quality of all relevant systematic reviews (SRs).""
- ""Had we identified any randomized controlled trials (RCTs), we would have used the Cochrane ‘Risk of bias’ tool [19] to assess their quality.""
- ""We used MINORS [20] to assess the quality of all relevant non-randomized studies (comparative or non-comparative).""
- ""Two reviewers independently assessed each included study and compared the scores for each item on the applicable quality assessment tool to reach a consensus.""

Reasoning: The authors clearly state that they used quality assessment tools (AMSTAR, Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool, and MINORS) to assess the scientific quality of the included studies. They also mention that two reviewers independently assessed each included study and reached a consensus. Therefore, the scientific quality of the included studies was assessed and documented.
Answer: [Yes]

A8. Was the scientific quality of the included studies used appropriately in formulating conclusions?
- ""The results of our systematic review should, therefore, be interpreted with caution.""

Reasoning: The authors mention that the results of the systematic review should be interpreted with caution due to the overall lack of good-quality evidence. However, they do not explicitly state whether the scientific quality of the included studies was used in formulating conclusions. Therefore, it is unclear if the scientific quality of the included studies was used appropriately in formulating conclusions.
Answer: [No]

A9. Were the methods used to combine the findings of studies appropriate?
- No relevant quotes.

Reasoning: The text does not mention any methods used to combine the findings of studies. Since the authors state that meta-analysis was not possible due to heterogeneity of the data, it is unclear if any other methods were used to combine the findings. Therefore, it is not clear if the methods used to combine the findings of studies were appropriate.
Answer: [NA]

A10. Was the likelihood of publication bias assessed?
- No relevant quotes.

Reasoning: The text does not mention any assessment of publication bias. Since the authors state that there were no RCTs and only two SRs of relatively low quality, it is unclear if publication bias was assessed. Therefore, it is not clear if the likelihood of publication bias was assessed.
Answer: [NA]

A11. Was the conflict of interest included?
- ""The authors declare that they have no conflict of interest.""

Reasoning: The authors explicitly state that they have no conflict of interest. Therefore, the conflict of interest was included.
Answer: [Yes]","A1. Was an 'a priori' design provided?
- ""We conducted a systematic review of literature focusing on the surgical treatment of IAT, including quality assessment of each study."" 
- ""We used a Dephi-like method [16] to determine the issues of greatest concern to pediatric surgeons regarding the surgical management of cryptorchid testes.""
- ""We sent an online survey to 34 experts with proficiency in this area, identified primarily on the basis of a literature search.""
- ""We developed a questionnaire listing all the issues raised by the experts in the first round.""
- ""We conducted electronic searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CINAHL from inception to September 2014.""
- ""We used the following search terms: “Cryptorchidism” AND “Intra-abdominal” OR “Abdomen/abdominal cavity/inguinal canal/groin.”""
- ""We included all studies that examined diagnostic and surgical correction techniques for IAT, even if this was not the primary focus of the study.""
- ""Our outcomes of interest were success of orchiopexy (testis viable and located in the scrotum), testicular atrophy, and intra-operative and post-operative complications.""
- ""Article screening took place in two stages—title and abstract, and full-text screening—both of which were conducted independently by two reviewers, followed by a consensus process.""
- ""We used AMSTAR [18] to assess the quality of all relevant systematic reviews (SRs).""
- ""Had we identified any randomized controlled trials (RCTs), we would have used the Cochrane ‘Risk of bias’ tool [19] to assess their quality.""
- ""We used MINORS [20] to assess the quality of all relevant non-randomized studies (comparative or non-comparative).""
- ""Two reviewers independently assessed each included study and compared the scores for each item on the applicable quality assessment tool to reach a consensus.""

Reasoning: The authors clearly describe the methods used to conduct the systematic review, including the search strategy, study selection process, and quality assessment tools used. They also mention using a Delphi-like method to determine the research question and issues of concern to pediatric surgeons. Therefore, an 'a priori' design was provided.
Answer: [Yes]

A2. Was there duplicate study selection and data extraction?
- ""Article screening took place in two stages—title and abstract, and full-text screening—both of which were conducted independently by two reviewers, followed by a consensus process.""
- ""Two reviewers independently assessed each included study and compared the scores for each item on the applicable quality assessment tool to reach a consensus.""

Reasoning: The study selection and data extraction processes were conducted independently by two reviewers, followed by a consensus process. Therefore, there was duplicate study selection and data extraction.
Answer: [Yes]

A3. Was a comprehensive literature search performed?
- ""We conducted electronic searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CINAHL from inception to September 2014.""
- ""We used the following search terms: “Cryptorchidism” AND “Intra-abdominal” OR “Abdomen/abdominal cavity/inguinal canal/groin.”""
- ""We also hand-searched the reference sections of included articles for additional relevant studies.""

Reasoning: The authors conducted a comprehensive literature search by searching multiple databases and hand-searching reference lists. They also provide details of the search terms used. Therefore, a comprehensive literature search was performed.
Answer: [Yes]

A4. Was the status of publication (i.e. grey literature) used as an inclusion criterion?
- No relevant quotes.

Reasoning: The text does not mention whether the status of publication was used as an inclusion criterion. Therefore, it is not clear if the authors searched for grey literature or unpublished literature.
Answer: [NA]

A5. Was a list of studies (included and excluded) provided?
- ""We performed full-text screening for these articles, excluding 17 that did not meet our criteria [7, 10, 22–36]. The remaining 31 studies comprised two SRs and 29 non-randomized studies; we quality assessed and summarized these studies (Table 1).""

Reasoning: The authors mention that they performed full-text screening and excluded 17 studies that did not meet their criteria. They also provide a summary table of the included studies. However, they do not explicitly state whether a list of excluded studies was provided. Therefore, it is unclear if a list of excluded studies was provided.
Answer: [No]

A6. Were the characteristics of the included studies provided?
- ""We quality assessed and summarized these studies (Table 1).""

Reasoning: The authors mention that they quality assessed and summarized the included studies, but they do not provide specific details about the characteristics of the included studies. Therefore, it is unclear if the characteristics of the included studies were provided.
Answer: [No]

A7. Was the scientific quality of the included studies assessed and documented?
- ""We used AMSTAR [18] to assess the quality of all relevant systematic reviews (SRs).""
- ""Had we identified any randomized controlled trials (RCTs), we would have used the Cochrane ‘Risk of bias’ tool [19] to assess their quality.""
- ""We used MINORS [20] to assess the quality of all relevant non-randomized studies (comparative or non-comparative).""
- ""Two reviewers independently assessed each included study and compared the scores for each item on the applicable quality assessment tool to reach a consensus.""

Reasoning: The authors clearly state that they used quality assessment tools (AMSTAR, Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool, and MINORS) to assess the scientific quality of the included studies. They also mention that two reviewers independently assessed each included study and reached a consensus. Therefore, the scientific quality of the included studies was assessed and documented.
Answer: [Yes]

A8. Was the scientific quality of the included studies used appropriately in formulating conclusions?
- ""The results of our systematic review should, therefore, be interpreted with caution.""

Reasoning: The authors mention that the results of the systematic review should be interpreted with caution due to the overall lack of good-quality evidence. However, they do not explicitly state whether the scientific quality of the included studies was used in formulating conclusions. Therefore, it is unclear if the scientific quality of the included studies was used appropriately in formulating conclusions.
Answer: [No]

A9. Were the methods used to combine the findings of studies appropriate?
- No relevant quotes.

Reasoning: The text does not mention any methods used to combine the findings of studies. Since the authors state that meta-analysis was not possible due to heterogeneity of the data, it is unclear if any other methods were used to combine the findings. Therefore, it is not clear if the methods used to combine the findings of studies were appropriate.
Answer: [NA]

A10. Was the likelihood of publication bias assessed?
- No relevant quotes.

Reasoning: The text does not mention any assessment of publication bias. Since the authors state that there were no RCTs and only two SRs of relatively low quality, it is unclear if publication bias was assessed. Therefore, it is not clear if the likelihood of publication bias was assessed.

Reasoning: The review considers the scientific quality of the included studies in formulating conclusions.

Response: [Yes]

A9. Were the methods used to combine the findings of studies appropriate? For the pooled results, a test should be done to ensure the studies were combinable, to assess their homogeneity (i.e., Chi-squared test for homogeneity, I2 ). If heterogeneity exists a random effects model should be used and/or the clinical appropriateness of combining should be taken into consideration (i.e., is it sensible to combine?). Note: Indicate “yes” if they mention or describe heterogeneity, i.e., if they explain that they cannot pool because of heterogeneity/variability between interventions.

The research question and inclusion criteria should be established before the conduct of the review. Note: Need to refer to a protocol, ethics approval, or pre-determined/a priori published research objectives to score a “yes.”

Quotes:
- ""This manuscript is mainly to systemically review the published reports that compared the efficacy and safety of robotic-assisted (RP) versus open pyeloplasty (OP) in children with ureteropelvic junction obstruction (UPJO)."" 
- ""We used the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis (PRISMA) statement to report our findings.""

Reasoning: The authors state that they conducted a systematic review and followed the PRISMA statement, indicating that they had a pre-determined research question and inclusion criteria.

Answer: [Yes]

A2. Was there duplicate study selection and data extraction? There should be at least two independent data extractors and a consensus procedure for disagreements should be in place. Note: 2 people do study selection, 2 people do data extraction, consensus process or one person checks the other’s work.

Quotes:
- ""Two of the authors (Hsu and Chang) independently did the literature search, quality assessment, and data extraction.""

Reasoning: The authors state that two authors independently conducted the literature search, quality assessment, and data extraction.

Answer: [Yes]

A3. Was a comprehensive literature search performed? At least two electronic sources should be searched. The report must include years and databases used (e.g., Central, EMBASE, and MEDLINE). Key words and/or MESH terms must be stated and where feasible the search strategy should be provided. All searches should be supplemented by consulting current contents, reviews, textbooks, specialized registers, or experts in the particular field of study, and by reviewing the references in the studies found. Note: If at least 2 sources + one supplementary strategy used, select “yes” (Cochrane register/Central counts as 2 sources; a grey literature search counts as supplementary).

Quotes:
- ""We searched PubMed® for comparative studies (from January 1990 to 2014 September) that compared the efficacy and safety of robotic versus open pyeloplasty.""
- ""We used the following keywords: robotic, pyeloplasty, ureteropelvic junction obstruction, children, and pediatric.""

Reasoning: The authors state that they performed a literature search in PubMed using specific keywords.

Answer: [Yes]

A4. Was the status of publication (i.e. grey literature) used as an inclusion criterion? The authors should state that they searched for reports regardless of their publication type. The authors should state whether or not they excluded any reports (from the systematic review), based on their publication status, language etc. Note: If review indicates that there was a search for “grey literature” or “unpublished literature,” indicate “yes.” SIGLE database, dissertations, conference proceedings, and trial registries are all considered grey for this purpose. If searching a source that contains both grey and non-grey, must specify that they were searching for grey/unpublished lit.

Quotes:
- No quotes provided.

Reasoning: The authors did not mention whether they searched for grey literature or unpublished literature.

Answer: [No]

A5. Was a list of studies (included and excluded) provided? A list of included and excluded studies should be provided. Note: Acceptable if the excluded studies are referenced. If there is an electronic link to the list but the link is dead, select “no.”

Quotes:
- ""Initial research yielded 104 abstracts, and a total of 102 abstracts were included for evaluation after duplicates were removed.""
- ""After excluding abstracts, which were not relevant to the topic, we retrieved full text of 15 studies for evaluation.""

Reasoning: The authors mention the number of abstracts included and excluded, but they do not provide a list of the included and excluded studies.

Answer: [No]

A6. Were the characteristics of the included studies provided? In an aggregated form such as a table, data from the original studies should be provided on the participants, interventions and outcomes. The ranges of characteristics in all the studies analyzed e.g., age, race, sex, relevant socioeconomic data, disease status, duration, severity, or other diseases should be reported. Note: Acceptable if not in table format as long as they are described as above.

Quotes:
- ""The demographic data of the patients in the 10 included trials are shown in Table 1.""
- ""The reported perioperative parameters in the enrolled studies are listed in Table 2.""

Reasoning: The authors provide tables that summarize the characteristics of the included studies.

Answer: [Yes]

A7. Was the scientific quality of the included studies assessed and documented? 'A priori' methods of assessment should be provided (e.g., for effectiveness studies if the author(s) chose to include only randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled studies, or allocation concealment as inclusion criteria); for other types of studies alternative items will be relevant. Note: Can include use of a quality scoring tool or checklist, e.g., Jadad scale, risk of bias, sensitivity analysis, etc., or a description of quality items, with some kind of result for EACH study (“low” or “high” is fine, as long as it is clear which studies scored “low” and which scored “high”; a summary score/range for all studies is not acceptable).

Quotes:
- No quotes provided.

Reasoning: The authors did not mention whether they assessed the scientific quality of the included studies.

Answer: [No]

A8. Was the scientific quality of the included studies used appropriately in formulating conclusions? The results of the methodological rigor and scientific quality should be considered in the analysis and the conclusions of the review, and explicitly stated in formulating recommendations. Note: Might say something such as “the results should be interpreted with caution due to poor quality of included studies.” Cannot score “yes” for this question if scored “no” for question A7.

Quotes:
- ""The current meta-analysis fails to validate robotic pyeloplasty as a standard of care in managing pediatric UPJO in the current status.""

Reasoning: The authors do not explicitly state whether they considered the scientific quality of the included studies in formulating their conclusions.

Answer: [No]

A9. Were the methods used to combine the findings of studies appropriate? For the pooled results, a test should be done to ensure the studies were combinable, to assess their homogeneity (i.e., Chi-squared test for homogeneity, I2 ). If heterogeneity exists a random effects model should be used and/or the clinical appropriateness of combining should be taken into consideration (i.e., is it sensible to combine?). Note: Indicate “yes” if they mention or describe heterogeneity, i.e., if they explain that they cannot pool because of heterogeneity/variability between interventions.

Quotes:
- ""Pooled analysis revealed significant heterogeneity (p = 0.008), and RP required longer time than OP by 64.26 min (95 % CI 37.58 to 90.93; p < 0.00001).""
- ""Pooled analysis revealed that hospital stay was significantly lower in the RP group by 0.95 days (95 % CI 0.38–1.52; p = 0.001).""
- ""Pooled analysis revealed that RP is associated with significantly higher hospital charge by 3.26 thousand USD (95 % CI 1.79–4.73 thousand USD; p < 0.00001).""
- ""Pooled data analysis showed that there was a significant higher overall complication rate in children undergoing RP (RR = 1.29, 95 CI 1.05–1.58, p = 0.001).""

Reasoning: The authors mention that they performed pooled analyses and report the results of these analyses.

Answer: [Yes]

A10. Was the likelihood of publication bias assessed? An assessment of publication bias should include a combination of graphical aids (e.g., funnel plot, other available tests) and/or statistical tests (e.g., Egger regression test, Hedges-Olken). Note: If no test values or funnel plot included, score “no”. Score “yes” if mentions that publication bias could not be assessed because there were fewer than 10 included studies.

Quotes:
- ""We analyzed the possible publication bias by generating funnel plots of the trials used for all of the evaluated comparisons of outcomes. No clear bias was apparent.""

Reasoning: The authors mention that they analyzed the possible publication bias by generating funnel plots, but they do not provide any results or conclusions from this analysis.

Answer: [No]

A11. Was the conflict of interest included? Potential sources of support should be clearly acknowledged in both the systematic review and the included studies. Note: To get a “yes,” must indicate source of funding or support for the systematic review AND for each of the included studies.

Quotes:
- ""The study is partly funded by Taipei Tzu Chi Hospital, Buddhist Tzu Chi Medical Foundation. TCRD-TPE-103-RT-7.""

Reasoning: The authors mention that the study was partly funded by Taipei Tzu Chi Hospital, Buddhist Tzu Chi Medical Foundation.

- No quotes provided.

Reasoning: The authors did not mention whether they searched for grey literature or unpublished literature.

Answer: [No]

A5. Was a list of studies (included and excluded) provided? A list of included and excluded studies should be provided. Note: Acceptable if the excluded studies are referenced. If there is an electronic link to the list but the link is dead, select “no.”

Quotes:
- ""Initial research yielded 104 abstracts, and a total of 102 abstracts were included for evaluation after duplicates were removed.""
- ""After excluding abstracts, which were not relevant to the topic, we retrieved full text of 15 studies for evaluation.""

Reasoning: The authors mention the number of abstracts included and excluded, but they do not provide a list of the included and excluded studies.

Answer: [No]

A6. Were the characteristics of the included studies provided? In an aggregated form such as a table, data from the original studies should be provided on the participants, interventions and outcomes. The ranges of characteristics in all the studies analyzed e.g., age, race, sex, relevant socioeconomic data, disease status, duration, severity, or other diseases should be reported. Note: Acceptable if not in table format as long as they are described as above.

Quotes:
- ""The demographic data of the patients in the 10 included trials are shown in Table 1.""
- ""The reported perioperative parameters in the enrolled studies are listed in Table 2.""

Reasoning: The authors provide tables that summarize the characteristics of the included studies.

Answer: [Yes]

A7. Was the scientific quality of the included studies assessed and documented? 'A priori' methods of assessment should be provided (e.g., for effectiveness studies if the author(s) chose to include only randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled studies, or allocation concealment as inclusion criteria); for other types of studies alternative items will be relevant. Note: Can include use of a quality scoring tool or checklist, e.g., Jadad scale, risk of bias, sensitivity analysis, etc., or a description of quality items, with some kind of result for EACH study (“low” or “high” is fine, as long as it is clear which studies scored “low” and which scored “high”; a summary score/range for all studies is not acceptable).

Quotes:
- No quotes provided.

Reasoning: The authors did not mention whether they assessed the scientific quality of the included studies.

Answer: [No]

A8. Was the scientific quality of the included studies used appropriately in formulating conclusions? The results of the methodological rigor and scientific quality should be considered in the analysis and the conclusions of the review, and explicitly stated in formulating recommendations. Note: Might say something such as “the results should be interpreted with caution due to poor quality of included studies.” Cannot score “yes” for this question if scored “no” for question A7.

Quotes:
- ""The current meta-analysis fails to validate robotic pyeloplasty as a standard of care in managing pediatric UPJO in the current status.""

Reasoning: The authors do not explicitly state whether they considered the scientific quality of the included studies in formulating their conclusions.

Answer: [No]

A9. Were the methods used to combine the findings of studies appropriate? For the pooled results, a test should be done to ensure the studies were combinable, to assess their homogeneity (i.e., Chi-squared test for homogeneity, I2 ). If heterogeneity exists a random effects model should be used and/or the clinical appropriateness of combining should be taken into consideration (i.e., is it sensible to combine?). Note: Indicate “yes” if they mention or describe heterogeneity, i.e., if they explain that they cannot pool because of heterogeneity/variability between interventions.

Quotes:
- ""Pooled analysis revealed significant heterogeneity (p = 0.008), and RP required longer time than OP by 64.26 min (95 % CI 37.58 to 90.93; p < 0.00001).""
- ""Pooled analysis revealed that hospital stay was significantly lower in the RP group by 0.95 days (95 % CI 0.38–1.52; p = 0.001).""
- ""Pooled analysis revealed that RP is associated with significantly higher hospital charge by 3.26 thousand USD (95 % CI 1.79–4.73 thousand USD; p < 0.00001).""
- ""Pooled data analysis showed that there was a significant higher overall complication rate in children undergoing RP (RR = 1.29, 95 CI 1.05–1.58, p = 0.001).""

Reasoning: The authors mention that they performed pooled analyses and report the results of these analyses.

Answer: [Yes]

A10. Was the likelihood of publication bias assessed? An assessment of publication bias should include a combination of graphical aids (e.g., funnel plot, other available tests) and/or statistical tests (e.g., Egger regression test, Hedges-Olken). Note: If no test values or funnel plot included, score “no”. Score “yes” if mentions that publication bias could not be assessed because there were fewer than 10 included studies.

Quotes:
- ""We analyzed the possible publication bias by generating funnel plots of the trials used for all of the evaluated comparisons of outcomes. No clear bias was apparent.""

Reasoning: The authors mention that they analyzed the possible publication bias by generating funnel plots, but they do not provide any results or conclusions from this analysis.

Answer: [No]

A11. Was the conflict of interest included? Potential sources of support should be clearly acknowledged in both the systematic review and the included studies. Note: To get a “yes,” must indicate source of funding or support for the systematic review AND for each of the included studies.

Quotes:
- ""The study is partly funded by Taipei Tzu Chi Hospital, Buddhist Tzu Chi Medical Foundation. TCRD-TPE-103-RT-7.""

Reasoning: The authors mention that the study was partly funded by Taipei Tzu Chi Hospital, Buddhist Tzu Chi Medical Foundation.

A9. Were the methods used to combine the findings of studies appropriate? For the pooled results, a test should be done to ensure the studies were combinable, to assess their homogeneity (i.e., Chi-squared test for homogeneity, I2 ). If heterogeneity exists a random effects model should be used and/or the clinical appropriateness of combining should be taken into consideration (i.e., is it sensible to combine?). Note: Indicate “yes” if they mention or describe heterogeneity, i.e., if they explain that they cannot pool because of heterogeneity/variability between interventions.

- ""Clinical studies published in the English literature were identified by a Medline literature search using PubMed (www.pubmed.com).""

Reasoning: Only one electronic source (PubMed) was used for the literature search.

Response: [No]

A4. Was the status of publication (i.e. grey literature) used as an inclusion criterion? The authors should state that they searched for reports regardless of their publication type. The authors should state whether or not they excluded any reports (from the systematic review), based on their publication status, language etc. Note: If review indicates that there was a search for “grey literature” or “unpublished literature,” indicate “yes.” SIGLE database, dissertations, conference proceedings, and trial registries are all considered grey for this purpose. If searching a source that contains both grey and non-grey, must specify that they were searching for grey/unpublished lit.

Quotes:
- No quotes provided.

Reasoning: No information is provided about the inclusion or exclusion of grey literature.

Quotes:
- ""Only RCS on pediatric VATS are available. Therefore, the best available evidence is Level 3.""

Reasoning: The scientific quality of the included studies is mentioned, but it is not explicitly stated how it was used in formulating the conclusions.

Response: [No]

A9. Were the methods used to combine the findings of studies appropriate? For the pooled results, a test should be done to ensure the studies were combinable, to assess their homogeneity (i.e., Chi-squared test for homogeneity, I2 ). If heterogeneity exists a random effects model should be used and/or the clinical appropriateness of combining should be taken into consideration (i.e., is it sensible to combine?). Note: Indicate “yes” if they mention or describe heterogeneity, i.e., if they explain that they cannot pool because of heterogeneity/variability between interventions.

Quotes:
- No quotes provided.

Reasoning: No information is provided about the methods used to combine the findings of the studies.

Response: [NA]

A10. Was the likelihood of publication bias assessed? An assessment of publication bias should include a combination of graphical aids (e.g., funnel plot, other available tests) and/or statistical tests (e.g., Egger regression test, Hedges-Olken). Note: If no test values or funnel plot included, score “no”. Score “yes” if mentions that publication bias could not be assessed because there were fewer than 10 included studies.

Quotes:
- No quotes provided.

Reasoning: No information is provided about the assessment of publication bias.

Response: [NA]

A11. Was the conflict of interest included? Potential sources of support should be clearly acknowledged in both the systematic review and the included studies. Note: To get a “yes,” must indicate source of funding or support for the systematic review AND for each of the included studies.

Quotes:

- ""The initial search yielded 187 potentially relevant articles, of which 172 articles were excluded because of the failure to meet the inclusion criteria. A total of 15 studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria and were analyzed in this review.""
- Yes, a list of included studies is provided.

A6. Were the characteristics of the included studies provided?
- ""A total of 15 studies (4 comparative retrospective, 8 retrospective, and 3 prospective) including 470 patients (264 LGEA) were identified; 344 (73%) patients underwent CI, 99 (21%) GPU, and 27 (6%) JI.""
- Yes, the characteristics of the included studies are provided.

A7. Was the scientific quality of the included studies assessed and documented?
- ""There are few prospective series, amounting to only 37 patients. Well-designed prospective comparative studies are lacking, major and minor postoperative complications are sometimes not properly defined, follow-up data are often deficient and when presented they are not homogenously described in the different studies.""
- No, the scientific quality of the included studies was not assessed or documented.

A8. Was the scientific quality of the included studies used appropriately in formulating conclusions?
- ""Comparison is challenging as outcomes are reported differently. GPU and CI appear comparable regarding the main outcomes of the present study: postoperative mortality, anastomotic complications, and graft loss. GPU seems to be associated with a higher respiratory morbidity but fewer gastrointestinal complications than CI.""
- Yes, the scientific quality of the included studies was used appropriately in formulating conclusions.

A9. Were the methods used to combine the findings of studies appropriate?
- ""However there are only two studies regarding JI and the reported results differ widely. Because of this large divergence in results, calculating only an overall weighted mean using a random effects model seems inappropriate.""
- No, the methods used to combine the findings of studies were not appropriate.

A10. Was the likelihood of publication bias assessed?
- No information is provided in the text regarding the assessment of publication bias.
- NA, the text does not provide information on the assessment of publication bias.

A11. Was the conflict of interest included?

- Yes, the conflict of interest was included.

Overall, the methodological quality of this systematic review is moderate. The review clearly states its objective and design, performs a comprehensive literature search, provides a list of included studies, and describes the characteristics of the included studies. However, the review does not assess the scientific quality of the included studies, does not appropriately combine the findings of studies, and does not assess the likelihood of publication bias."
