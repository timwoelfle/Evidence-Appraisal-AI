Reasoning: The trial aimed to measure two primary outcomes: relapse rate and global brain atrophy rate. These outcomes are relevant to patients with MS and are consistent with a pragmatic approach to primary outcome.

Score: [5]

1. Primary analysis:
Quote: ""A Poisson regression controlling for a priori defined potential confounding variables (age, gender and time since diagnosis) and expressed as an incidence-rate-ratio was applied to compare the annual relapse rate between the RCT groups.""

Reasoning: The trial used a Poisson regression analysis to compare the annual relapse rate between the RCT groups, controlling for potential confounding variables. This suggests that the trial aimed to provide a rigorous and comprehensive analysis of the primary outcome, which is consistent with an explanatory approach to primary analysis.

Quote: ""Pregnant women were eligible if they were to undergo delivery by lower segment caesarean section through a transverse abdominal incision, irrespective of fever in labour, gestational age, or multiple pregnancies. Women were not eligible if there was a clear indication for a particular surgical technique or material to be used that prevented any of the allocated interventions being used, if they had more than one previous caesarean section, or if they had already been recruited into the trial.""

Reasoning: The trial included pregnant women who were to undergo a lower segment caesarean section through a transverse abdominal incision, regardless of fever in labor, gestational age, or multiple pregnancies. However, women were excluded if there was a clear indication for a particular surgical technique or material to be used that prevented any of the allocated interventions being used, if they had more than one previous caesarean section, or if they had already been recruited into the trial. This suggests that the trial had some exclusion criteria, but still aimed to include a broad range of participants who would typically undergo a caesarean section.

8. Primary outcome:
Quote: ""Primary outcomes were fatigue severity (Global Fatigue Severity (GFS) subscale of the Fatigue Assessment Instrument (FAI)), (18) disease-specific quality of life (QOL) (total score on the Multiple Sclerosis Impact Scale, V.1 (MSIS-29, V.1)) (19) and self-efficacy for managing fatigue (Multiple Sclerosis-Fatigue Self-Efficacy scale—adapted from the Control subscale of the MS Self-Efficacy scale). (20)""
Reasoning: The trial's primary outcomes are relevant to participants, as they measure fatigue severity, disease-specific quality of life, and self-efficacy for managing fatigue. These outcomes are likely to be of importance to patients with MS.

9. Primary analysis:
Quote: ""The main analysis was intention-to-treat but we also conducted a ‘per protocol’ analysis (excluding participants who attended fewer than four FACETS sessions).""
Reasoning: The trial used intention-to-treat analysis, which is a pragmatic approach to data analysis as it includes all available data. However, the trial also conducted a per-protocol analysis, which is a more explanatory approach as it excludes participants who did not adhere to the intervention.

Aim To evaluate two exercise programmes promoting physical activity among older people. Design and setting Pragmatic three-arm, parallel-design cluster randomised controlled trial involving 1256 people aged ≥65 years (of 20 507 invited) recruited from 43 general practices in London, Nottingham, and Derby. Method Practices were randomised to the class-based Falls Management Exercise programme (FaME), the home-based Otago Exercise Program (OEP), or usual care. The primary outcome was the proportion reaching the recommended physical activity target 12 months post-intervention. Secondary outcomes included falls, quality of life, balance confidence, and costs. Results In total, 49% of FaME participants reached the physical activity target compared with 38% for usual care (adjusted odds ratio 1.78, 95% confidence interval [CI] =1.11 to 2.87, P = 0.02). Differences between FaME and usual care persisted 24 months after intervention. There was no significant difference comparing those in the OEP (43% reaching target at 12months) and usual-care arms. Participants in the FaME arm added around 15 minutes of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity per day to their baseline level; this group also had a significantly lower rate of falls (incident rate ratio 0.74, 95% CI = 0.55 to 0.99, P = 0.042). Balance confidence was significantly improved in both intervention arms. The mean cost per extra person achieving the physical activity target was £1740. Attrition and rates of adverse reactions were similar. Conclusion The FaME programme increases self-reported physical activity for at least 12 months post-intervention and reduces falls in people aged ≥65 years, but uptake is low. There was no statistically significant difference in reaching the target, or in falls, between the OEP and usual-care arms. Keywords aged people; exercise promotion; falls; general practice; physical activity.""

Reasoning: The trial used a three-arm, parallel-design cluster randomized controlled trial involving 1256 people aged 65 years or older recruited from 43 general practices in London, Nottingham, and Derby. The interventions were the home-based Otago Exercise Program (OEP) and the class-based Falls Management Exercise programme (FaME). The trial used existing resources and staff to deliver the interventions, which reflects a pragmatic approach to organization.

1. Primary outcome:
Quote: ""The primary outcome was the proportion of participants who reported reaching ≥150 minutes of MVPA per week.""

Reasoning: The trial used a relatively pragmatic approach to the primary outcome, with the proportion of participants who reported reaching 150 minutes of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) per week as the primary outcome. This outcome is relevant to participants and reflects a pragmatic approach to measuring the effectiveness of the interventions.

Score: [4]

1. Primary analysis:
Quote: ""Participants were analysed in the groups to which they were randomised, regardless of whether they received the intervention or not, and multiple imputation was used to include all participants in the analyses.""

Reasoning: The trial used a relatively pragmatic approach to the primary analysis, with participants analyzed in the groups to which they were randomized, regardless of whether they received the intervention or not. Multiple imputation was used to include all participants in the analyses, which reflects a pragmatic approach to handling missing data.

Score: [4]"," 1. Eligibility:
Quote: ""Patients were eligible to participate if they were: • community dwelling aged ≥65 years; • independently mobile (with or without a walking aid); and • physically able to take part in group exercise. Patients were excluded if they: • had experienced ≥3 falls in the previous year; • had unstable clinical conditions; • would be unable to follow instructions about exercise safely; or • were receiving palliative care. Attempts were made to exclude those who were already exercising at, or above, the target level through a pre-assessment screening telephone call.""

Reasoning: The trial includes a broad range of participants who are community-dwelling and aged 65 years or older. The exclusion criteria are limited to those who have experienced multiple falls, have unstable clinical conditions, are unable to follow exercise instructions safely, or are receiving palliative care. The trial also attempts to exclude those who are already exercising at or above the target level. This suggests a relatively pragmatic approach to eligibility criteria.

1. Recruitment:
Quote: ""Practices were recruited with assistance from Primary Care Research Networks for London, Derby, and Nottingham. Patients aged ≥65 years were identified by searches of computerised medical records and invited to participate by letter from their GP.""

Reasoning: The trial recruited practices with the assistance of Primary Care Research Networks and identified potential participants through searches of computerized medical records. Participants were invited to participate by letter from their GP. This approach is relatively pragmatic, as it uses existing networks and medical records to identify and recruit participants.

Score: [4]

1. Setting:
Quote: ""A three-arm, parallel-design cluster controlled trial was used, with allocation at the level of general practice in two centres (London and Nottingham/Derby).""

Reasoning: The trial was conducted in two centers, London and Nottingham/Derby, and used a cluster-randomized design with allocation at the level of general practice. This approach is relatively pragmatic, as it reflects the real-world setting in which the intervention would be delivered.

Aim To evaluate two exercise programmes promoting physical activity among older people. Design and setting Pragmatic three-arm, parallel-design cluster randomised controlled trial involving 1256 people aged ≥65 years (of 20 507 invited) recruited from 43 general practices in London, Nottingham, and Derby. Method Practices were randomised to the class-based Falls Management Exercise programme (FaME), the home-based Otago Exercise Program (OEP), or usual care. The primary outcome was the proportion reaching the recommended physical activity target 12 months post-intervention. Secondary outcomes included falls, quality of life, balance confidence, and costs. Results In total, 49% of FaME participants reached the physical activity target compared with 38% for usual care (adjusted odds ratio 1.78, 95% confidence interval [CI] =1.11 to 2.87, P = 0.02). Differences between FaME and usual care persisted 24 months after intervention. There was no significant difference comparing those in the OEP (43% reaching target at 12months) and usual-care arms. Participants in the FaME arm added around 15 minutes of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity per day to their baseline level; this group also had a significantly lower rate of falls (incident rate ratio 0.74, 95% CI = 0.55 to 0.99, P = 0.042). Balance confidence was significantly improved in both intervention arms. The mean cost per extra person achieving the physical activity target was £1740. Attrition and rates of adverse reactions were similar. Conclusion The FaME programme increases self-reported physical activity for at least 12 months post-intervention and reduces falls in people aged ≥65 years, but uptake is low. There was no statistically significant difference in reaching the target, or in falls, between the OEP and usual-care arms. Keywords aged people; exercise promotion; falls; general practice; physical activity.""

Reasoning: The trial used a three-arm, parallel-design cluster randomized controlled trial involving 1256 people aged 65 years or older recruited from 43 general practices in London, Nottingham, and Derby. The interventions were the home-based Otago Exercise Program (OEP) and the class-based Falls Management Exercise programme (FaME). The trial used existing resources and staff to deliver the interventions, which reflects a pragmatic approach to organization.

1. Flexibility (delivery):
Quote: ""The FaME intervention took place in a group once a week and included exercises to be carried out at home, unsupervised, twice weekly. The OEP was undertaken at home, unsupervised, and comprised exercises to be done three times per week. The programmes included the following progression: • OEP — ankle weights and hand holds; and • FaME — resistance bands and hand holds, plus a move to more dynamic balance work and floor work with postural stability instructors.""
