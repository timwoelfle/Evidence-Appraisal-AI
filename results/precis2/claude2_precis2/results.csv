1. Eligibility criteria

Quotes:
- ""Pregnant women were eligible if they were to undergo delivery by lower segment caesarean section through a transverse abdominal incision, irrespective of fever in labour, gestational age, or multiple pregnancies.""
- ""Women were not eligible if there was a clear indication for a particular surgical technique or material to be used that prevented any of the allocated interventions being used, if they had more than one previous caesarean section, or if they had already been recruited into the trial.""

Explanation: The eligibility criteria are quite broad, including women undergoing first or second caesarean section, irrespective of gestational age or presence of fever. The only exclusions are if there is a clear indication for a particular technique, more than one previous caesarean section, or previous recruitment into the trial. This suggests the trial intends to recruit a patient population similar to routine practice.

Score: [4] Rather pragmatic

2. Recruitment

Quotes: 
- ""Each participating site, advised by their research ethics committee, decided how to provide trial information to women and seek informed consent.""

Explanation: The paper does not provide much detail on the recruitment process. However, it seems that participants were recruited during their routine prenatal care, as the trial was discussed with eligible women and consent obtained. There is no mention of any special recruitment efforts. 

Score: [4] Rather pragmatic

3. Setting

Quotes:
- ""CORONIS was undertaken at 19 sites in Argentina, Chile, Ghana, India, Kenya, Pakistan, and Sudan.""

Explanation: The trial was conducted across multiple sites in 7 countries. The sites appear to be routine maternity care settings in these countries, rather than specialized trial or academic centers. This matches the real-world settings where caesarean sections are performed.

Score: [5] Very pragmatic

4. Organization

Quotes:
- ""Each regional coordinator (one per country, except India, which was split into two regions) started and documented a training programme that ensured that surgeons operating within the trial were familiar with the techniques being compared before participating.""

Explanation: The paper mentions that surgeons received training on the techniques being compared, but does not suggest any other changes to staffing, resources, or care delivery compared to routine practice. The caesarean sections seem to have been incorporated into standard care at the participating sites.

Score: [5] Very pragmatic 

5. Flexibility: Delivery

Quotes:
- ""All non-allocated surgical elements and all other aspects of the caesarean section procedure were undertaken at the discretion of the surgeon."" 
- ""In particular, there were no restrictions on the type of suture material that could be used, and standard measures to achieve haemostasis were employed regardless of the allocated intervention.""

Explanation: The surgeons had flexibility in how the allocated intervention was delivered along with all other aspects of care. No protocol was enforced aside from the allocated technique. This matches the flexibility found in routine practice.

Quotes:
- ""Data were collected at trial entry, immediately after surgery, at hospital discharge (including hospital transfer or death), and at about 6 weeks after delivery.""
- ""Women who did not return at 6 weeks were located and interviewed by telephone or during a home visit.""

Explanation: Follow-up consisted of data collection at standard time points through 6 weeks post-delivery. Women were contacted if they did not return for the 6 week follow-up. This does not seem substantially different from routine follow-up after delivery.

They were provided with, for the 12-month follow-up period, a telerehabilitation kit (mobile phone, pulse oximeter, dumbbells and exercise bicycle) along with a user guide with detailed instructions on the use of the mobile device to deliver data collected to the web-based platform after completion of each scheduled session."" 

Explanation: Patients in the intervention group were provided equipment to do home-based training. This represents additional resources compared to usual care. However, it was integral to the intervention being evaluated.

Score: [3]

Flexibility: delivery
Quote: 
""A highly pragmatic design would aim to slot the intervention into the usual organisation of care for the condition of interest, making use of no more than the existing healthcare staff and resources in that setting.""

Explanation: The delivery of the intervention appears reasonably flexible, allowing participants to complete the exercise program at home. However, some guidance was provided on performing the exercises.

Score: [4] 

Flexibility: adherence 
Quotes:
""In usual care, health professionals encourage patients to take medication or follow therapy as best they can, and such encouragement would not count against a pragmatic design; if it also happens in usual care, allowing it in the trial is a pragmatic design decision.""

""Patients were considered non-adherent if they did not attend any 2 follow-up appointments and there was no clear clinical justification for not attending.""

Explanation: Some measures were in place to track adherence via follow-up appointments. But no special efforts beyond usual encouragement were made to enforce adherence.

Score: [4]

Follow-up
Quote:  
""After the randomization visit, follow-up appointments were arranged for both groups at 3, 9 and 12 months.""

Explanation: Follow-up appointments were more frequent than usual care.

Score: [3]

Primary outcome
Quote:
""Exercise tolerance (the ability to sustain exercise) was assessed using distance covered in the 6MWT."" 

Explanation: The 6MWT is a standard and clinically meaningful measure of exercise tolerance for COPD patients.

Score: [5]

Primary analysis
Quote: 
""Most trials are a superiority design so the most pragmatic approach with regard to the analysis would be to make no special allowance in the analysis for non-adherence, practice variability, etc. In other words, the pragmatic approach to the analysis would typically be an intention-to-treat analysis using all available data.""

Explanation: The analysis appears to follow an intention-to-treat approach, but details are limited.

Score: [4]

In summary, the trial has reasonably pragmatic design choices for most domains, with some concessions made for additional follow-up and providing equipment to enable the home-based intervention. The eligibility criteria, setting, primary outcome, and analysis approach appear aligned with a pragmatic attitude."

The eligibility criteria are fairly broad, including adults with mild to moderate MS based on EDSS scores. The criteria seem to target the general MS population that would be eligible for this intervention in usual care. The inclusion of the full range of EDSS scores from 1 to 6.5 makes it more pragmatic.

Recruitment
Score: [3] Equally pragmatic and explanatory

Relevant quotes:  
""In August 2015, 1 of the MS nurses at the Department of Neurology, Nordland Hospital Trust in Bodø, Norway, sent out invitation letters with a consent form to 160 persons with MS who were registered at the MS outpatient clinic, had EDSS scores of 0 to 7, and lived in 1 of the 6 municipalities included in the study.""

The participants were recruited by invitation letters sent to a registry of MS patients at a hospital clinic. This recruitment method requires some administrative effort beyond usual care. However, it still relies on patients already engaged in care for MS rather than widespread advertising or other special efforts. The recruitment path is moderately pragmatic.

Setting
Score: [5] Very pragmatic 

Relevant quotes:
""The GroupCoreDIST intervention was conducted by 6 physical therapists in 6 municipalities in Norway."" 

The setting of the trial matches the usual care setting, with the intervention delivered in multiple municipalities by local physical therapists. The pragmatic setting increases applicability.

Organization
Score: [4] Rather pragmatic

Relevant quote:  
""Six neurological physical therapists conducted the intervention after being trained in GroupCoreDIST for 5 days.""

The physical therapists received some additional training in GroupCoreDIST, but were still general neurological physical therapists like those who would deliver the intervention in usual care. The organization is fairly similar to usual care.

Flexibility: delivery

Relevant quotes:
""The physical therapists had varied experience (between 7–25 years) and certification (2 had both a master’s degree in neurological physical therapy and were clinical specialists in neurological physical therapy, 1 was a clinical specialist in neurological physical therapy, and 3 were generalists in physical therapy).""

""The physical therapists conducted an individual clinical examination of each participant. The examinations were followed by group sessions, in which the physical therapists chose from 33 exercises, all with 5 levels of difficulty to address each individual’s impairments underlying his or her balance disturbance."" 

The protocol allows flexibility for therapists to choose exercises tailored to each patient's impairments and balance issues. But there is still a defined set of exercises to select from, making delivery moderately pragmatic.

Flexibility: adherence

Follow-up:

Relevant quote: 
""Outcomes were assessed at baseline, and at three months (post-intervention) and nine months after randomisation.""

The follow-up is moderately pragmatic. Outcomes are assessed at 3 and 9 months, which provides longer term follow-up but is still a reasonable frequency that does not greatly exceed typical practice. No details are provided about the nature or duration of the follow-up visits.

Score: [3]

Primary outcome:

Relevant quote:
""The primary outcome was self-reported exercise behaviour at three months using the Godin Leisure Time Exercise Questionnaire (GLTEQ).""

The primary outcome is very pragmatic. Self-reported exercise behavior is highly relevant and meaningful to participants in an exercise intervention trial. The GLTEQ is a simple questionnaire that could be easily implemented in real world practice.

Score: [5]

Primary analysis:

Relevant quote: 
""All analyses were by intention to treat, whereby participants were analysed in the arm to which they were randomised irrespective of whether they complied with the intervention."" 

The primary analysis is very pragmatic. An intention-to-treat approach is used, meaning all randomized participants are included regardless of adherence or dropout. This matches real world implementation and avoids bias from excluding non-compliers.

Eligibility criteria 
Relevant quote: ""The inclusion criterion for the study was a diagnosis of multiple sclerosis, and therefore the spectrum of clinical presentations was broad, as would be expected in this client population.""

The inclusion criteria reflect usual care, as any MS patient would be eligible to receive massage therapy. No exclusion criteria are mentioned that would limit the participants to a narrower population than seen in usual practice.

Score: [5] 

Recruitment
Relevant quote: ""Clients attending the clinic were interviewed, and their case histories recorded. The research project was explained, and written informed consent was obtained.""

Participants were recruited when they attended the clinic, reflecting how patients would access massage therapy in usual care. No additional recruitment methods were used.

Score: [5]

Setting
Relevant quote: ""Participants were clients seen in the multiple sclerosis clinics at Sutherland-Chan School, in which the study was conducted.""

The setting was a massage therapy teaching clinic, which matches the setting where patients would receive massage therapy treatment in usual care. 

Score: [5] 

Organisation
Relevant quote: ""All treatment plans were approved by the clinical teacher in charge. The teacher also monitored treatment delivery, which involved the application of a variety of techniques appropriate to the client’s needs.""

The organisation of care delivery matches usual practice - massage therapy students delivering treatment under supervision of a clinical teacher. No additional resources or training were provided.

Score: [5]

Flexibility: delivery
Relevant quote: ""Although further work would be beneficial, the results of this study support previous findings indicating that massage therapy increases the self-efficacy of clients with multiple sclerosis, potentially resulting in a better overall adjustment to the disease and an improvement in psycho-emotional state.""

Mindfulness exercises included observation of sensory, affective, and cognitive domains of perceptible experience. The all-day retreat integrated familiar exercises and presented new ones. In all, 6 MBI courses for the experimental arm of the study were individually conducted by 2 experienced, certified teachers, each with ≥9 years teaching experience.""

Reasoning: The delivery of the mindfulness intervention seems moderately explanatory - it follows a structured program with classes, a retreat, and homework. However, some flexibility was allowed in the specific exercises and topics covered to meet patients' needs.

Score: [2]

Flexibility (adherence):

Relevant quotes: None relevant.

Reasoning: No details are provided on measures to enforce or improve adherence.

Score: [NA]

Follow-up:

Relevant quotes:  
""Reported outcome measurements occurred within 2 weeks before and after intervention and 6 months postintervention.""

Reasoning: Outcomes were assessed at baseline, post-intervention, and 6 months. This follow-up schedule seems moderately pragmatic as it allows assessment after a reasonably long period but does not appear excessive.

Score: [3]

Primary outcome:

Relevant quotes:
""Primary outcomes included disease-specific and disease-aspecific HRQOL, depression, and fatigue.""

""HRQOL was assessed with 2 inventories, one developed for patients with chronic disorders (i.e., disease-aspecific) and the other specifically for patients with MS."" 

Reasoning: The primary outcomes of HRQOL, depression, and fatigue are patient-centered and clinically meaningful. Using both a disease-specific and a general chronic disease HRQOL measure is a pragmatic choice.

Score: [4] 

Primary analysis:

Relevant quotes:  
""Intention-to-treat analyses are reported. Data of missing study patients were imputed by linear multiple regression that adjusted for age, gender, and disease progression (entry EDSS score; STATISTICA 6.0).""

Reasoning: An intention-to-treat approach was used with imputation of missing data. This is a pragmatic analysis approach.

Relevant quote: ""Inclusion criteria—Patients with confirmed diagnosis: ≥16 years of age with unilateral facial nerve weakness of no identifiable cause who presented to primary care or an emergency department and could be referred to a collaborating otorhinolaryngologist <72 hours after the onset of symptoms.""

This trial has strict inclusion criteria requiring laboratory confirmation of diagnosis and referral to a specialist, which would not reflect eligibility in usual care where Bell's palsy is often diagnosed clinically by a general practitioner. The age limit and short time window for enrollment also make the sample less representative.

Recruitment
Score: [2] Rather explanatory 

Relevant quote: ""Initially extra resources were used to recruit patients at 53 primary care practices. Patients were recruited via a postal questionnaire to identify symptoms and trial eligibility, not just to invite to participate.""

Recruitment via postal questionnaire to screen for eligibility is more explanatory than recruiting during routine clinic visits, as it requires additional resources and may bias the sample towards more motivated and adherent participants.

Setting
Score: [1] Very explanatory

""Inclusion criteria were patients in South East London, living with MS and deemed (by clinicians) to have one or more of unresolved symptoms, psychosocial concerns, end-of-life issues, progressive illness, or complex needs (i.e., palliative care needs).""

""Exclusion criteria included if the referring staff or the screening deemed patients had very urgent needs or were deteriorating rapidly when immediate referral to the service was offered.""

The eligibility criteria are rather explanatory because patients were screened by clinicians and had to have specific palliative care needs to be included. Patients with very urgent needs were excluded, further limiting the participants to a specific subset of MS patients. This differs from a very pragmatic approach where any MS patient could participate.

2. Recruitment

Score: [3] Equally pragmatic and explanatory 

Relevant quotes: 
""Subjects were 69 people with MS, 52 of whom took part in the trial.""

""Referrals were screened by a consultant in palliative medicine who was independent from delivering the service."" 

""Educational seminars informed local health and social care professionals about the PCT.""

The recruitment is a mix of pragmatic and explanatory elements. Patients were referred by their regular clinicians, which is pragmatic. However, informational seminars were used to encourage referrals and patients were further screened, making recruitment more targeted than just routine referrals. Overall this seems equally pragmatic and explanatory.

3. Setting

Score: [5] Very pragmatic

Relevant quote: 
""Patients in South East London, living with MS""

The setting of patients' homes in South East London is very pragmatic, as this is the real-world setting where MS patients live and receive usual care.

Relevant quote:
""In addition to continuing to receive usual services, patients in the fast-track group received care from a PCT. This comprised one part-time consultant in palliative medicine, one part-time clinical nurse specialist, one administrator, and one psychosocial worker.""

The organization is rather pragmatic - patients received the intervention at home from a small palliative care team in addition to their usual care. It did not require substantially more resources or expertise than available in usual practice.

5. Flexibility: delivery

Score: [4] Rather pragmatic

Relevant quote:

1. Eligibility criteria 

Quote: ""Participants had a confirmed diagnosis of multiple sclerosis, an Extended Disability Status Scale score of 5 (ambulatory without aid or rest for about 200 m) to 6.5 (constant bilateral assistance required to walk about 20 m without resting), stable rehabilitation and drug therapy for 30 days before entry into the study, cognitive scores of over 24 on the Mini-Mental State Examination and access to the intervention sites using their own or public transport.""

The eligibility criteria are moderately pragmatic as they include patients typical of those who would receive this intervention in usual care - adults with moderate multiple sclerosis able to walk short distances. However, the narrow range on the EDSS scale makes it less pragmatic. 

Score: [3]

2. Recruitment

Quote: ""Of the 873 patients on the clinical register for multiple sclerosis 159 patients were deemed suitable for the study. These people were sent invitation letters and participant information sheets. Forty-three potential participants expressed an interest in participating.""

The recruitment method of using a clinical register to identify and invite potential participants is moderately pragmatic as this registry would likely be used to identify patients for the intervention in real world practice. 

Score: [3] 

3. Setting

Quote: ""The intervention took place at two different geographical locations (Site A and Site B).""

Conducting the trial at two community leisure centers makes the setting moderately pragmatic compared to real world care. However, limiting it to only two sites reduces pragmatism.

Score: [3]

4. Organization

Quote: ""Each group was led by two instructors (one physiotherapist and one fitness instructor). The same physiotherapist was present at both sites; however fitness instructors were different between sites.""

Using one physiotherapist and one fitness instructor to deliver the intervention is moderately pragmatic as it utilizes staffing that would be available in real world practice.

Score: [3]

5. Flexibility: Delivery

Quote: ""Through discussion with the instructors, participants chose which level of each exercise they deemed appropriate and also when and how each exercise should be progressed. Participants worked at a self-regulated pace for each exercise.""

Allowing flexibility in how the exercises were delivered based on participants' needs and self-regulated pace is very pragmatic, similar to real world practice.

However, some patients were excluded such as those with cognitive impairment or recent relapse/treatment changes, which reduces generalizability.

Score: [3]

Recruitment:

Relevant quotes: 
""Participants were recruited in three UK centres (Poole, Bristol, Southampton/Portsmouth) from primary or secondary care, or via MS Society newsletters/websites.""

The recruitment methods used multiple strategies including routine clinic visits as well as newsletters and websites. This mix of recruitment methods is moderately pragmatic. Routine clinic recruitment alone would be more pragmatic.

Score: [3] 

Setting:

Relevant quotes:
""Participants were recruited in three UK centres (Poole, Bristol, Southampton/Portsmouth) from primary or secondary care, or via MS Society newsletters/websites.""

The trial was conducted across multiple centers in both primary and secondary care settings. This diversity of settings matches routine practice and is pragmatic.

Organisation:

Relevant quote: 
""The FACETS intervention consists of six sessions (∼90 min duration) held weekly and facilitated in groups of 6–12 by two health professionals with experience of working with people with MS and group-work (such as occupational therapists, nurses or physiotherapists).""

The intervention was delivered by existing healthcare staff with experience in MS care. No additional resources or training were mentioned. This matches routine practice and is pragmatic.

Score: [4]

Flexibility: delivery

Relevant quote:
""The facilitator manual provides guidance on preparation and delivery, detailed session content, notes and suggested timings, and a checklist of facilitator objectives as well as signposts to additional resources. Sessions are delivered via PowerPoint; hence can be easily replicated."" 

The intervention delivery was protocolized with manuals, suggested scripts, and powerpoint slides. This reduces flexibility compared to routine practice and is more explanatory.

Eligibility criteria

Quotes:
""Inclusion criteria—Patients with confirmed diagnosis: ≥16 years of age with unilateral facial nerve weakness of no identifiable cause who presented to primary care or an emergency department and could be referred to a collaborating otorhinolaryngologist <72 hours after the onset of symptoms.""

""Exclusion criteria—Pregnancy, breast feeding, uncontrolled diabetes, peptic ulcer disease, suppurative otitis media, herpes zoster, multiple sclerosis, systematic infection, sarcoidosis and other rare conditions, and an inability to provide informed consent."" 

""Extra test—Randomised controlled trial of Bell’s palsy treatment required senior otorhinolaryngologist in hospitals to confirm a patient’s eligibility to participate. Bell’s palsy is usually diagnosed by a general practitioner in primary care.""

Explanation: The trial has strict inclusion/exclusion criteria and requires an extra test by a specialist not routinely done in usual care. This makes the eligibility criteria more explanatory.

Follow-up:

Quotes: 
""Clinical follow-up until patient left hospital (discharge or death) or until 30 days after surgery, whichever was the longer, so more than usual care.""

""Monitoring intensity involved more extensive data collection than usual:
Pre-operation—three-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) Holter monitor (Flashcard with 2×48 hour recording) set up on each patient and maintained for 72 hours.
Troponin values at 1, 3, and 7 days after surgery (more usual for only 1 and 3 days after surgery)
ECG after randomisation and at 7 and 30 days after surgery.""

Explanation: The trial had more frequent and longer follow-up than usual care, with additional data collection. This makes follow-up more explanatory.

Score: [2]

Primary outcome:

Quotes:  
""Primary outcome—Recovery of facial function as rated on the House-Brackmann scale."" 

""Test not routinely used in primary care and requires training. It is, however, an easy clinical test widely used in secondary care for grading recovery from facial nerve paralysis caused by damage to lower motor neurons.""

""Central adjudication—Photographs taken of patients were assessed and graded independently by a panel of three experts (not general practitioners, who usually assess).""

Explanation: The primary outcome requires specialized training and central adjudication not routine in usual care. This makes the primary outcome more explanatory.

Patients were recruited during their regular clinic visits, no special efforts were made to identify or recruit patients. This matches how patients would access this intervention in usual care.

Setting
Quote: ""This study was conducted in outpatient clinics of 10 rheumatology centres across the UK."" 

Score: [5] Very pragmatic

The trial was conducted in the same setting (outpatient rheumatology clinics) as usual care for RA patients. Using multiple centers also increases generalizability.

Organisation
Quote: ""The CNS had a median experience of 10 years in their current post while the rheumatologists had a median of 9 years at consultant level.""

Score: [4] Rather pragmatic 

The CNS and rheumatologists had typical experience levels, no additional training or resources were provided. The care delivery seems largely similar to usual care.

Flexibility: delivery
Quote: ""The NLC interventions usually include allocated 30-min time slots in which the CNS takes history, performs physical examination, pain control, prescribing or recommending medication and dosage changes, intra-articular or intramuscular steroid injections, provision of patient education, psychosocial support and ordering blood tests or X-rays.""

Score: [4] Rather pragmatic

The nurse-led intervention is described in reasonable detail but does not seem overly prescriptive. Nurses were allowed flexibility in delivery while working within their scope of practice.

Flexibility: adherence
Quote: No relevant information provided.

Score: [NA]

Follow-up
Quote: ""Independent assessors were health professionals trained to perform joint counts and calculating the DAS28."" 

Score: [3] Equally pragmatic and explanatory

Patients were followed up more frequently than usual care to assess outcomes. However, follow-up visits were limited to joint counts and questionnaires, without extensive additional data collection.

Primary outcome
Quote: ""The primary outcome was DAS28 and secondary outcomes were pain severity (pain-VAS), fatigue (fatigue-VAS) and duration of morning stiffness measured at each study visit.""

Score: [4] Rather pragmatic

DAS28 is a standard composite measure of RA disease activity used in clinical practice. The other outcomes are also clinically relevant for patients.

Primary analysis
Quote: ""Analysis followed per-protocol (PP) and intention-to-treat (ITT) approaches.""

Score: [5] Very pragmatic

The analysis was by intention-to-treat, consistent with a pragmatic approach.

In summary, most domains were scored as rather pragmatic or very pragmatic, with reasonably broad eligibility criteria, recruitment through usual clinics, multicenter design, delivery flexibility, and clinically meaningful outcomes. The trial design seems well matched to the intended purpose of evaluating nurse-led care in real-world settings."," Here are the PRECIS-2 domain scores and explanations for the given full text:

Eligibility criteria 
Quote: ""The inclusion criteria were: a positive diagnosis of RA (1987 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria), age 18 years or older and the ability to complete questionnaires unaided.""

Score: [3] The eligibility criteria include both patients with established CVD and those at high estimated risk, which matches usual care. However, they had to have indications for all the polypill components, which may exclude some patients who would normally receive some of the treatments. Overall this seems a mix of pragmatic and explanatory elements.

2. Recruitment

Quote: ""Participants randomized to the ‘polypill-based strategy’ received a polypill containing aspirin 75 mg, simvastatin 40 mg, lisinopril 10 mg and either atenolol 50 mg or hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg.

""Patients were eligible for inclusion if they were aged 16 years or older and presented within 3 weeks after sustaining a displaced fracture of the proximal humerus that involved the surgical neck.""
""Excluded patients had associated dislocation of the injured shoulder joint, open fracture, insufficient mental capacity to understand the trial or instructions for rehabilitation, comorbidities precluding surgery or anesthesia, clear indication for surgery such as severe soft-tissue compromise, multiple injuries (upper limb fractures), pathological fracture (other than osteoporotic), terminal illness, or were not a resident in the hospital catchment area.""

The eligibility criteria are moderately pragmatic. Patients of all adult ages are included, which is pragmatic. However, patients with comorbidities precluding surgery are excluded, as well as those with clear indications for surgery, which makes it more explanatory. Overall, I think it balances out to be equally pragmatic and explanatory.

2. Recruitment
Score: [4] 
Relevant quotes: 
""Patients received their allocated treatment from the recruiting hospital.""

The patients seem to be recruited during routine care at the participating hospitals. There is no mention of any special recruitment efforts like media campaigns or incentives. This makes recruitment rather pragmatic.

3. Setting
Score: [4]

Relevant quotes:  
""The PROFHER collaborators recruited patients for this pragmatic, open, multicenter, parallel-group, superiority, randomized clinical trial between September 2008 and April 2011 from orthopedic departments (fracture clinics or wards) at 32 acute UK National Health Service hospitals.""

The trial is conducted at 32 acute NHS hospitals across the UK that routinely provide standard surgical and nonsurgical fracture treatment. This multicenter design across routine care settings is a rather pragmatic choice.

4. Organization
Score: [4]

Relevant quotes:
""Care pathways for all patients included outpatient- and community-based rehabilitation, which primarily comprised 1 or more 1-on-1 sessions with a physiotherapist that focused on restoring function.""

The organization of care delivery seems very similar to usual care, with standard rehabilitation sessions. No extra staffing, training or resources are mentioned. This is a rather pragmatic choice.

5. Flexibility: Delivery
Score: [4]

Relevant quotes: 
""It was emphasized that good standards of care, both surgical and nonsurgical, should be provided throughout the treatment pathway for the injury, including surgical care or management of the sling, postoperative care, and rehabilitation in both groups.""

Patients were excluded if they: had experienced ≥3 falls in the previous year; had unstable clinical conditions; would be unable to follow instructions about exercise safely; or were receiving palliative care.""

Score: [3] The eligibility criteria are moderately pragmatic. The trial is limited to community-dwelling older adults who are mobile and able to participate in group exercise. However, they exclude some patients who may benefit from the intervention in usual care, such as those with a history of falls or unstable conditions. Overall, the criteria strike a balance between being pragmatic and ensuring patient safety.

Recruitment
Quote: ""Practices were recruited with assistance from Primary Care Research Networks for London, Derby, and Nottingham. Patients aged ≥65 years were identified by searches of computerised medical records and invited to participate by letter from their GP."" 

Score: [4] Recruitment is done through primary care practices, which is moderately pragmatic as this is where most older patients receive care. Patients are identified from medical records and invited by letter, which requires some additional effort beyond usual care. Overall, recruitment methods are more pragmatic than explanatory.
