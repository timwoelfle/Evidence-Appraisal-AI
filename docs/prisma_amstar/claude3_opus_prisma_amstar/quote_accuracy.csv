101,PRISMA,"Abstract Incidental appendectomy is the removal of the vermiform appendix accompanying another operation, without evidence of acute appendicitis. It is generally performed to eliminate the risk of future appendicitis. The risks and benefits of incidental appendectomy during various operations in children have been debated for over a century, but need to be revisited in light of innovations in medical practice, including minimally invasive surgery, improved imaging techniques, and use of the appendix as a tubular conduit for reconstruction. A comprehensive review was undertaken of the techniques, pathology, risks of appendectomy, utility of the appendix, and incidental appendectomy in the treatment of specific pediatric medical conditions. A comprehensive literature search was performed, and retrieved results were reviewed for relevance to the topic.

Results: Minimally invasive adrenalectomy appears superior to open adrenalectomy for small tumors. The potential advantages of MIA are appealing for postoperative pain, risk of intestinal obstruction, and quality of scars. The most common approach is the transperitoneal lateral laparoscopy, which allows for a large working space. For small tumors or for bilateral adrenalectomy, the prone retroperitoneoscopy is a promising new technique. In children, the learning curve is an issue because the indications are rare. The most common indication is neuroblastoma without image-defined surgical risk factors. The incidence of local recurrence is low, but the follow-up is short in most cases.

135,PRISMA,"The most well-known study evaluating iNO use in CDH comes from the Neonatal Inhaled Nitric Oxide Study Group (NINOS) group [27]. This multicenter, randomized controlled trial evaluated the use of iNO in 53 CDH infants compared to iNO use in 16 patients with a larger study evaluating iNO use in term or near-term non-CDH infants [30]. All patients were >34 weeks gestational age, did not have congenital heart disease and had an oxygenation index (OI) >25. The authors hypothesized that the use of iNO would reduce the risk of death by day 120 or need for ECMO, or the need for supplemental oxygen at 30 days. Pre-iNO treatment with sedation, analgesia, neuromuscular blockade, alkalinization, and inotropic support was not standardized. Fifty-one infants had an echocardiogram performed before or during iNO. iNO was initiated at only 76% demonstrated evidence of pulmonary hypertension. iNO was initiated at 20 PPM but could be increased to 80 PPM if there was no response. The data is summarized in Table 7. (See Tables 3–6.) Two reviews of the Extracorporeal Life Support Organization Registry (ELSO) from 1990–1999 and 1991–2006, respectively, attempted to determine the optimal mode of ECMO in CDH [59,60]. Both studies identified VA as the predominant mode of registry centers (82% vs. 18% VV). Guner et al. [56] noted that while survival was 50% with VV compared to 46% in VA, after controlling for birth weight, APGAR score, gestational age, prenatal diagnosis, and other markers of severity available in the registry, survival between groups was equivalent [59].

If failure occurs, all attempts should be made towards optimizing the function of the native bowel. This can be achieved by cooperation of pediatric surgeons and gastroenterologists.

Heterogeneity between studies was tested using Cochran chi-square Q test and quantified by calculating I2. Quality appraisal of included studies was performed. Meta-analysis was conducted as a surrogate measure using a random effects model. Results: Our search yielded 288 citations, of which 11 (622 patients) met inclusion criteria and were incorporated into the systematic review.

71,PRISMA,"As bariatric surgery seems to be associated with a risk of complications and has the potential to impact on future patterns for a lifetime, a balance must be made between the potential benefits and harms at an individual case level. Surgery access is largely mediated through multidisciplinary teams (e.g. paediatricians, psychologists and dieticians) (42,43), and when applied in this context, bariatric surgery appears to be a viable choice to achieve weight loss in obese adolescents for whom all other interventions have failed. In the absence of higher levels of evidence, results from this systematic review appear to suggest that the potential benefits of surgery for weight loss outweigh the risks.

We also noted a significant learning curve with the LO, resulting in a markedly shorter operation time than in the initial cases [13]. Abolyosr et al.
