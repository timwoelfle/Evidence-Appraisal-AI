The risks and benefits of incidental appendectomy during various operations in children have been debated for over a century, but need to be revisited in light of innovations in medical practice, including minimally invasive surgery, improved imaging techniques, and use of the appendix as a tubular conduit for reconstruction. A detailed review was undertaken of the techniques, pathology, risks of appendectomy, utility of the appendix, and incidental appendectomy in the treatment of specific pediatric medical conditions. A comprehensive literature search was performed, and retrieved results were reviewed for relevance to the topic. The decision to perform a pediatric incidental appendectomy relies on informed consideration of the individual patient’s co-morbid conditions, the indication for the initial operation, the future utility of the appendix, and the risk of future appendiceal pathology.""
Reasoning: The abstract provides a structured summary of the review, including the background, objectives, data sources, methods, results, and conclusions.
Response: [Yes]

P3. Introduction / Rationale: Describe the rationale for the review in the context of what is already known.
Quotes: ""Rationale: Incidental appendectomy (IA) is defined as the removal of the vermiform appendix accompanying another operation, without evidence of acute appendicitis. Advocates for IA cite ease of resection, low morbidity, no additional anesthetic risks, high incidence of disease in specimens, and elimination of confusion over future conflicting diagnosis [1]. Opponents argue that transecting an organ containing colonic flora in an otherwise clean procedure violates sound surgical principles and increases operative time and morbidity. Prior to IA, a surgeon must consider the incidence of appendicitis and other appendiceal diseases, associated procedural morbidity, potential functions of the appendix, co-morbidities, and pathologic findings in incidentally removed appendices [2].""

- Quote: ""Abstract: Purpose: Minimally invasive adrenalectomy (MIA) is the criterion standard for removal of small adrenal tumors in adults. The purpose of this review was to determine the place of MIA in children. Methods: The authors conducted a systematic review of the pediatric and adult literature about MIA, focusing on the technique and indications. Results: Minimally invasive adrenalectomy appears superior to open adrenalectomy for small tumors. The potential advantages of MIA are appealing for postoperative pain, risk of intestinal obstruction, and quality of scars. The most common approach is the transperitoneal lateral laparoscopy, which allows for a large working space. For small tumors or for bilateral adrenalectomy, the prone retroperitoneoscopy is a promising new technique. In children, the learning curve is an issue because the indications are rare. The most common indication is neuroblastoma without image-defined surgical risk factors. The incidence of local recurrence is low, but the follow-up is short in most cases. Conclusions: Minimally invasive adrenalectomy is promising for removal of small adrenal tumors. Long-term follow-up is required to evaluate the efficacy of MIA in neuroblastomas. Benign diseases are excellent candidates for this minimally invasive technique.""

The purpose of this review was to determine the place of MIA in children. Methods: The authors conducted a systematic review of the pediatric and adult literature about MIA, focusing on the technique and indications. Results: Minimally invasive adrenalectomy appears superior to open adrenalectomy for small tumors. The potential advantages of MIA are appealing for postoperative pain, risk of intestinal obstruction, and quality of scars. The most common approach is the transperitoneal lateral laparoscopy, which allows for a large working space. For small tumors or for bilateral adrenalectomy, the prone retroperitoneoscopy is a promising new technique. In children, the learning curve is an issue because the indications are rare. The most common indication is neuroblastoma without image-defined surgical risk factors. The incidence of local recurrence is low, but the follow-up is short in most cases. Conclusions: Minimally invasive adrenalectomy is promising for removal of small adrenal tumors. Long-term follow-up is required to evaluate the efficacy of MIA in neuroblastomas. Benign diseases are excellent candidates for this minimally invasive technique.""

Baseline such as age, gender and crossing vessel, perioperative outcomes such as length of stay, operative time, overall complications, and success rate were compared. All the meta-analyses were performed in Revman 5.2. Results: 15 comparative studies and one RCT were eligible and included in the meta-analysis. Compared with OP, LP groups might be associated with shorted length of hospital stay (WMD: -1.92, 95% CI: -2.45--1.39), reduced complications (OR: 0.71, 95% CI: 0.49-1.01) and equal success rate (RD: 0.01, 95% CI: -0.02-0.04), but prolonged operative time (WMD: 48.64, 95% CI: 31.16-66.12).

Abstract / Structured summary: Provide a structured summary including, as applicable: background; objectives; data sources; study eligibility criteria, participants, and interventions; study appraisal and synthesis methods; results; limitations; conclusions and implications of key findings; systematic review registration number.
Quotes: ""Abstract: Objective: Aim of the study was to compare the outcomes after laparoscopic pyloromyotomy (LP) with those of open pyloromyotomy (OP) for infantile pyloric stenosis. Method: We conducted searches until February 2009 in multiple databases and identified randomized controlled trials comparing LP with OP for pyloric stenosis. Results were expressed using the odds ratio (OR) for categorical variables and standard weighted mean differences (SMD) for continuous outcomes. Study quality was assessed using the Cochrane Handbook 5.0.1 guidelines and statistical analysis was performed using RevMan 5.0.8 software. Results: 3 studies totaling 492 infants were included. The results showed no significant differences in complications between the groups with regard to wound infection (OR: 1.77, 95 % CI 0.58–5.35), mucosal perforations (OR: 0.96, 95 % CI: 0.22 – 4.26), incisional hernia or granuloma (OR: 1.39, 95 % CI: 0.41–4.73), incomplete pyloromyotomy (OR: 0.13, 95 % CI: 0.02– 1.07), substantial vomiting (OR: 0.67, 95 % CI: 0.30– 1.52) and total complications (OR: 0.91, 95 % CI: 0.54 – 1.53). Although the combined result of 2 studies also indicated an insignificant discrepancy in time-related outcomes for full time to feeds, length of stay after surgery and operating time (SMD: 0.78, 95 % CI: − 0.50–2.06; SMD: 1.27, 95 % CI: − 1.56 – 4.10; SMD: − 0.46, 95 % CI: − 1.11 – 0.20, respectively), another study indicated shorter times for LP procedures (p = 0.002, 0.027, and 0.008, respectively). Conclusions: Only a few trials were available for analysis. Heterogeneity was seen between studies, but the available trials were of high quality. The present study shows that both OP and LP are equally safe and effective procedures for the management of pyloric stenosis in children. However, there was a trend in LP toward shorter time time-related outcomes.""
Reasoning: The abstract provides a structured summary of the study.
Response: [Yes]

P3. Introduction / Rationale: Describe the rationale for the review in the context of what is already known.
Quotes: ""Pyloric stenosis, also known as infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis (IHPS), results in a functional gastric outlet obstruction because of hypertrophy and hyperplasia of the muscular layers in the pylorus. It is the most common cause of vomiting requiring surgical intervention in infants [1, 2] , affecting up to approximately 1– 4 per 1 000 live births [3, 4] . Pyloromyotomy is an effective surgical intervention with rare mortality and has traditionally been performed via an open technique since the early 20th century. Ramstedt pyloromyotomy is easily performed and associated with minimal complications [5] . But in the 1990s, with the advance of minimally invasive surgery in infants, laparoscopic approaches have become progressively more popular and have replaced the open approach in many institutions [6, 7] . However, the operative approach is currently debated in the literature following the use of laparoscopic pyloromyotomy (LP) and open pyloromyotomy (OP).""

Response: [Yes]

P25. Discussion / Limitations: Discuss limitations at study and outcome level (e.g., risk of bias), and at review-level (e.g., incomplete retrieval of identified research, reporting bias).
Quotes: ""As with any systematic review, the limitations of this study reflect those of the individual studies. Most relied on information from databases. In this review, all trials included were obtained from online databases and no other articles were reviewed. Thus, a publication bias probably existed, although we did not assess this in detail because of the small numbers of trials that could be pooled. The heterogeneity of some variables in this study is also worthy of comment. 3 variables (full time to feed, length of stay after surgery, operating time) exhibited significant heterogeneity, as indicated by the I2 values which were all above 50 % . Possible explanations include the following factors [8] . First, the studies were all from different centers. Second, the procedures were performed by a number of different surgeons with different levels of skill and proficiency. Third, different centers may be at different points on the learning curve for LP. Moreover, the reintroduction of feeds postoperatively was based on protocols that differed among centers, and differences in feeding protocols are likely to strongly influence the time to full feeds and therefore increase the heterogeneity. The effect of different postoperative feeding protocols between treatment groups in individual studies on the time taken to achieve full feeds and the postoperative length of stay may be significant.

Quotes: ""Abstract: Objective: Aim of the study was to compare the outcomes after laparoscopic pyloromyotomy (LP) with those of open pyloromyotomy (OP) for infantile pyloric stenosis. Method: We conducted searches until February 2009 in multiple databases and identified randomized controlled trials comparing LP with OP for pyloric stenosis. Results were expressed using the odds ratio (OR) for categorical variables and standard weighted mean differences (SMD) for continuous outcomes. Study quality was assessed using the Cochrane Handbook 5.0.1 guidelines and statistical analysis was performed using RevMan 5.0.8 software. Results: 3 studies totaling 492 infants were included. The results showed no significant differences in complications between the groups with regard to wound infection (OR: 1.77, 95 % CI 0.58–5.35), mucosal perforations (OR: 0.96, 95 % CI: 0.22 – 4.26), incisional hernia or granuloma (OR: 1.39, 95 % CI: 0.41–4.73), incomplete pyloromyotomy (OR: 0.13, 95 % CI: 0.02– 1.07), substantial vomiting (OR: 0.67, 95 % CI: 0.30– 1.52) and total complications (OR: 0.91, 95 % CI: 0.54 – 1.53). Although the combined result of 2 studies also indicated an insignificant discrepancy in time-related outcomes for full time to feeds, length of stay after surgery and operating time (SMD: 0.78, 95 % CI: − 0.50–2.06; SMD: 1.27, 95 % CI: − 1.56 – 4.10; SMD: − 0.46, 95 % CI: − 1.11 – 0.20, respectively), another study indicated shorter times for LP procedures (p = 0.002, 0.027, and 0.008, respectively). Conclusions: Only a few trials were available for analysis. Heterogeneity was seen between studies, but the available trials were of high quality. The present study shows that both OP and LP are equally safe and effective procedures for the management of pyloric stenosis in children. However, there was a trend in LP toward shorter time time-related outcomes.""

Response: [Yes]

P3. Introduction / Rationale: Describe the rationale for the review in the context of what is already known.
Quotes: ""Pyloric stenosis, also known as infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis (IHPS), results in a functional gastric outlet obstruction because of hypertrophy and hyperplasia of the muscular layers in the pylorus. It is the most common cause of vomiting requiring surgical intervention in infants [1, 2] , affecting up to approximately 1– 4 per 1 000 live births [3, 4] . Pyloromyotomy is an effective surgical intervention with rare mortality and has traditionally been performed via an open technique since the early 20th century. Ramstedt pyloromyotomy is easily performed and associated with minimal complications [5] . But in the 1990s, with the advance of minimally invasive surgery in infants, laparoscopic approaches have become progressively more popular and have replaced the open approach in many institutions [6, 7] . However, the operative approach is currently debated in the literature following the use of laparoscopic pyloromyotomy (LP) and open pyloromyotomy (OP).""

Response: [Yes]

P25. Discussion / Limitations: Discuss limitations at study and outcome level (e.g., risk of bias), and at review-level (e.g., incomplete retrieval of identified research, reporting bias).
Quotes: ""As with any systematic review, the limitations of this study reflect those of the individual studies. Most relied on information from databases. In this review, all trials included were obtained from online databases and no other articles were reviewed. Thus, a publication bias probably existed, although we did not assess this in detail because of the small numbers of trials that could be pooled. The heterogeneity of some variables in this study is also worthy of comment. 3 variables (full time to feed, length of stay after surgery, operating time) exhibited significant heterogeneity, as indicated by the I2 values which were all above 50 % . Possible explanations include the following factors [8] . First, the studies were all from different centers. Second, the procedures were performed by a number of different surgeons with different levels of skill and proficiency. Third, different centers may be at different points on the learning curve for LP. Moreover, the reintroduction of feeds postoperatively was based on protocols that differed among centers, and differences in feeding protocols are likely to strongly influence the time to full feeds and therefore increase the heterogeneity. The effect of different postoperative feeding protocols between treatment groups in individual studies on the time taken to achieve full feeds and the postoperative length of stay may be significant. An additional weakness was the fact that the number of RCTs and patients included is small, which has limited the ability to compare the relative efficacy of the treatments.""

Quotes: ""Abstract: Objective: The aim of the study was to review evidence-based data regarding the use of antibiotics for the treatment of appendicitis in children. Data Source: Data were obtained from PubMed, MEDLINE, and citation review. Study Selection: We conducted a literature search using “appendicitis” combined with “antibiotics” with children as the target patient population. Studies were selected based on relevance for the following questions: (1) What perioperative antibiotics should be used for pediatric patients with nonperforated appendicitis? (2) For patients with perforated appendicitis treated with appendectomy: a. What perioperative intravenous antibiotics should be used? b. How long should perioperative intravenous antibiotics be used? c. Should oral antibiotics be used? (3) For patients with perforated appendicitis treated with initial nonoperative management, what antibiotics should be used in the initial management? Results: Children with nonperforated appendicitis should receive preoperative, broad-spectrum antibiotics. In children with perforated appendicitis who had undergone appendectomy, intravenous antibiotic duration should be based on clinical criteria. Furthermore, broad-spectrum, single, or double agent therapy is as equally efficacious as but is more cost-effective than triple agent therapy. If intravenous antibiotics are administered for less than 5 days, oral antibiotics should be administered for a total antibiotic course of 7 days. For children with perforated appendicitis who did not initially undergo an appendectomy, the duration of broad-spectrum, intravenous antibiotics should be based on clinical symptoms. Conclusions: Current evidence supports the use of guidelines as described above for antibiotic therapy in children with acute and perforated appendicitis.""

Methods: A search was made for studies published up until 31 August 2010 using the terms “lymphatic sparing varicocelectomy”, “laparoscopy”, “adolescent” and “children” in the Medline, Embase, Ovid, Web of Science, and Cochrane databases. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and observational clinical studies (OCSs) comparing LSV and LNSV were included. A systematic review and meta-analysis was performed using odds ratios (ORs) for dichotomous variables. Results: Out of 127 studies, 2 RCTs and 4 OCSs were eligible for inclusion, comprising 489 cases of LSV and 307 cases of LNSV. The hydrocele rates after LSV were significantly lower than after LNSV (OR = 0.19; 95 % confidence interval [CI] = 0.10 to 0.36; p < 0.00001). However, no significant difference was observed between LSV and LNSV with regard to recurrence (OR = 0.65; 95 % CI = 0.32 – 1.33; p = 0.24) or catch-up growth (OR = 2.14; 95 % CI = 0.97–4.72; p = 0.06).

Current guidelines do not recommend one treatment over the other, and there is ongoing uncertainty regarding clinical management. Methods: We conducted a structured search of Medline, Embase, trial registries, and the gray literature. We included studies that compared outcomes for FG and GJ in children with neurologic impairment. Results: We identified 556 children from three retrospective studies who underwent FG (n = 431) or GJ (n = 125). There were no differences in rates of pneumonia (17% vs 19%, p = 0.74) or mortality (13% vs 14%, p = 0.76). Few deaths were due to procedural complications (1%) or reflux (2%). There was a trend towards more major complications with FG (29%) compared to GJ (12%) (risk ratio = 1.70, 0.85–3.41, p = 0.14). Minor complications were more common with GJ (70%) than FG (45%), but this difference was also not statistically significant (risk ratio = 0.38, 0.05–3.07, p = 0.36).

Materials and Methods: Published studies until the end of October 2010 were searched from Medline, Embase, Web of Science, Ovid, and Cochrane databases. The literature search, quality assessment, and data extraction were independently performed by two reviewers. A systematic review and meta-analysis were performed by using Review Manager 4.2.8 software. Results: Of 1403 studies, one randomized controlled trial (RCT), two prospective comparative studies, and six retrospective observational studies were eligible for inclusion criteria, comprising 694 cases of LP and 7334 cases of OP. The OP has significantly reduced operative time (weighted mean difference [WMD] = 59.00; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 41.15 to 76.85; P < 0.00001) and higher stent placement rate (odds ratio [OR] = 5.97; 95% CI = 3.17 to 11.26; P < 0.00001) compared with LP, whereas the duration of hospital stay was shorter in the LP group (WMD = - 0.40; 95% CI = - 0.77 to - 0.03; P = 0.03). No difference was observed between LP and OP regarding complications (OR = 0.78; 95% CI = 0.46 to 1.34; P = 0.37) or success rate (OR = 1.76; 95% CI = 0.71 to 4.36; P = 0.22). Conclusions: LP is a minimally invasive, safe, and effective therapy method for UPJ obstruction in children, with shorter hospital stay and excellent outcomes, and without additional risk of postoperative complications. Because of the publishing bias, a series of RCTs are necessary to explore the efficiencies of LP in the management of UPJ obstruction in children.""

P2. Abstract / Structured summary: Provide a structured summary including, as applicable: background; objectives; data sources; study eligibility criteria, participants, and interventions; study appraisal and synthesis methods; results; limitations; conclusions and implications of key findings; systematic review registration number.
Quotes: ""Abstract: Background: Excision has been established as a standard management practice for choledochal cysts in the last few decades. The two most commonly performed methods of reconstruction after excision are hepaticoduodenostomy (HD) and Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy (HJ), of which the HJ is favored by most surgeons. Evidence concerning the optimal method of reconstruction is, however, sparse. Materials and Methods: Studies comparing outcomes from HD and HJ after choledochal cyst excision were identified by searching Medline, Ovid, Search Medica, Elsevier Clinicalkey, Google Scholar and Cochrane library. Suitable studies were chosen and data extracted for meta-analysis. Outcomes evaluated included operative time, hospital stay and incidence of postoperative bile leak, cholangitis, reflux/gastritis, anastomotic stricture, bleeding, intestinal obstruction and re-operative rate. Pooled odds ratios (OR) were calculated for dichotomous variables; pooled mean differences (MD) were measured for continuous variables. Results: Six retrospective studies were included in this meta-analysis, comprising a total of 679 patients, 412 of whom (60.7%) underwent HD, and the remainder, 267(39.3%) underwent HJ. Although, HD group had slightly shorter hospital stay (MD: 0.30; 95% CI: −0.22–0.39; P b 0.00001) it showed a higher incidence of postoperative reflux/gastritis (OR: 0.08; 95% CI: − 0.02–0.39; P = 0.002). However, the other outcomes such as bile leak, cholangitis, anastomotic stricture, bleeding, operative time, reoperation rate and adhesive intestinal obstruction did not differ between HD and HJ groups. Conclusions: HD shows higher postoperative reflux/gastritis than HJ but a shorter hospital stay. There are few good-quality studies that compare the outcomes from HD and HJ, meaning that caution should be exercised in the generalization of the results of this meta-analysis, which suggests HD to be comparable with HJ in terms of other complications, operative benefits and outcomes.""

Response: [Yes]

P3. Introduction / Rationale: Describe the rationale for the review in the context of what is already known.
Quotes: ""Choledochal cysts are congenital bile duct anomalies with cystic dilatation of the biliary tree and have potential for various complications. Most of the reported cases in the world come from Asia but it is not uncommon in the western world. Complete resection of the extra hepatic bile duct is the accepted management of choledochal cyst [1]. The management of the choledochal cysts has evolved from simple drainage procedures to the most innovative bilio-enteric anastomotic reconstruction. Biliary reconstruction is now commonly performed by one of several techniques, including Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy (HJ), hepaticoduodenostomy (HD), and jejunal interposition hepaticoduodenostomy [2] and [3].

P2. Abstract / Structured summary: Provide a structured summary including, as applicable: background; objectives; data sources; study eligibility criteria, participants, and interventions; study appraisal and synthesis methods; results; limitations; conclusions and implications of key findings; systematic review registration number.
Quotes: ""Abstract: Background: Excision has been established as a standard management practice for choledochal cysts in the last few decades. The two most commonly performed methods of reconstruction after excision are hepaticoduodenostomy (HD) and Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy (HJ), of which the HJ is favored by most surgeons. Evidence concerning the optimal method of reconstruction is, however, sparse. Materials and Methods: Studies comparing outcomes from HD and HJ after choledochal cyst excision were identified by searching Medline, Ovid, Search Medica, Elsevier Clinicalkey, Google Scholar and Cochrane library. Suitable studies were chosen and data extracted for meta-analysis. Outcomes evaluated included operative time, hospital stay and incidence of postoperative bile leak, cholangitis, reflux/gastritis, anastomotic stricture, bleeding, intestinal obstruction and re-operative rate. Pooled odds ratios (OR) were calculated for dichotomous variables; pooled mean differences (MD) were measured for continuous variables. Results: Six retrospective studies were included in this meta-analysis, comprising a total of 679 patients, 412 of whom (60.7%) underwent HD, and the remainder, 267(39.3%) underwent HJ. Although, HD group had slightly shorter hospital stay (MD: 0.30; 95% CI: −0.22–0.39; P b 0.00001) it showed a higher incidence of postoperative reflux/gastritis (OR: 0.08; 95% CI: − 0.02–0.39; P = 0.002). However, the other outcomes such as bile leak, cholangitis, anastomotic stricture, bleeding, operative time, reoperation rate and adhesive intestinal obstruction did not differ between HD and HJ groups. Conclusions: HD shows higher postoperative reflux/gastritis than HJ but a shorter hospital stay. There are few good-quality studies that compare the outcomes from HD and HJ, meaning that caution should be exercised in the generalization of the results of this meta-analysis, which suggests HD to be comparable with HJ in terms of other complications, operative benefits and outcomes.""

P3. Introduction / Rationale: Describe the rationale for the review in the context of what is already known.
Quotes: ""Choledochal cysts are congenital bile duct anomalies with cystic dilatation of the biliary tree and have potential for various complications. Most of the reported cases in the world come from Asia but it is not uncommon in the western world. Complete resection of the extra hepatic bile duct is the accepted management of choledochal cyst [1]. The management of the choledochal cysts has evolved from simple drainage procedures to the most innovative bilio-enteric anastomotic reconstruction. Biliary reconstruction is now commonly performed by one of several techniques, including Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy (HJ), hepaticoduodenostomy (HD), and jejunal interposition hepaticoduodenostomy [2] and [3].

This article attempts to outline the efficacy, the indications, contraindications, surgical technique and therapeutic possibilities of laparoscopy in BAT. Pediatric surgery articles and those addressing penetrating abdominal wounds, nontraumatic abdominal emergencies and iatrogenic injuries were excluded from this review. Results: Sixty-six articles were reviewed, which included 22 case studies, 27 case reports, 17 reviews and 2 guidelines.

Although most commonly used in the neurologically impaired, it has also been used in those with no neurological impairment. The main objective of this study was to determine morbidity and mortality for this procedure. Methods: All published cases of esophagogastric dissociation in children were identified. Series were updated where possible by personal communication with the author. Patient characteristics, indications, morbidity, and mortality were analyzed. Results: One hundred eighty-one cases were identified. One hundred seventeen were primary operations and 64 were rescue procedures. There were 29 (16.0%) early complications and 28 (15.5%) late complications with 6 (3.3%) deaths related to the procedure of a total of 35 deaths. Twenty-one patients (11.6%) required re-operation in the study periods. Conclusions: Esophagogastric dissociation has an acceptable morbidity and mortality.

The purpose of this review is to update the use of MIS in pediatric oncological surgery over the past five years. Methods The authors conducted a systematic review of papers published between 2009 and 2014 focusing on indications and results of the technique. Results New indications in Wilms tumor, pheochromocytoma, and lung nodules have emerged, thanks to the growing use of MIS in benign urological and thoracic surgery with satisfactory results. Case control studies comparing MIS to open approach have been published for the first time in more classical indications such as neurogenic tumors, while robot-assisted procedure has shown concern in results about its early experience in solid tumors.

- Quote: ""Objective: To determine overall complication rates of the tubularized incised plate (TIP) repair and assess the effects of technical modifications, length of follow-up and geographical location of reported results. Materials and methods: A systematic literature search was undertaken, using Medline and Pubmed, in order to identify relevant articles. Random effects models were used to estimate pooled complication rates. Meta-regression was performed for each outcome by using mixed effects models with type of hypospadias (primary distal, primary proximal and secondary) as predictors. Results: Of the 189 articles that were identified, 49 studies (4675 patients) were included in the analysis. Fistula and re-operation rates were significantly higher in secondary repairs (15.5% and 23.3%) compared to primary proximal (10.3% and 12.2%) and primary distal (5.7% and 4.5%) (P Z 0.045 and P < 0.001, respectively). Technical modifications reduced fistula rates from 10.3% to 3.3% (P Z 0.003) and re-operation rates from 13.6% to 2.8% (P Z 0.001). The rate of meatal stenosis was highest in the secondary repairs, with follow-up >1 year (12.7%). Comparison of geographical location showed that complication rates for all but one variable were significantly lower in North America when compared to Europe and the rest of the world. Mean meatal stenosis rates were 1.8% in North America, 3.4% in Europe and 8.2% in the rest of the world (P Z 0.002). This remained significant in a multivariable model incorporating repair technique and length of follow-up (P Z 0.046). Mean rates of urethral stricture, fistula and re-operation followed a similar pattern (P Z 0.045, P Z 0.009 and P < 0.001, respectively). Mean follow-up was shortest in the North American group, at 11.9 months, compared to Europe, at 17.8 months, and the rest of the world, at 18.9 months. Discussion: The present meta-analysis has shown that the lowest complication rates for the TIP repair are when it is applied to primary distal hypospadias. Complication rates are higher for all variables when the TIP repair is used for primary proximal hypospadias. Lower complication rates than those reported in this TIP review have been documented in some studies using a staged repair for correction of primary proximal or secondary hypospadias [11,12,68], implying that a staged approach may be superior to the TIP repair in these settings. Documentation of follow-up duration was limited, making assessment of the impact of length of follow-up difficult. Geographical location had a noticeable effect on outcome, with all but one complication being lower in the North American than the other groups. Mean follow-up was shortest in North America and it is suggested that the short follow-up in the North American studies may have led to under-reporting of late complications. Conclusion: The TIP repair has evolved to incorporate modifications that have significantly lowered complications. Higher complication rates are seen with secondary and proximal repairs; however, limited, published long-term data impair a true assessment of outcome.""

P3. Introduction / Rationale: Describe the rationale for the review in the context of what is already known.
- Quote: ""Over 300 methods of surgical repair have been described for the correction of hypospadias, with no one procedure accepted as the gold standard for each degree of hypospadias. First described in 1994 by Snodgrass [1], the tubularized incised plate (TIP) urethroplasty has become the most popular technique for distal hypospadias [2,3]. Originally described for correction of distal hypospadias, it has also been applied to more severe proximal forms. There is a wide discrepancy between published complication rates for different repair types [4e16] and a poor evidence base for the current management of hypospadias.""

- Quote: ""Objective: To determine overall complication rates of the tubularized incised plate (TIP) repair and assess the effects of technical modifications, length of follow-up and geographical location of reported results. Materials and methods: A systematic literature search was undertaken, using Medline and Pubmed, in order to identify relevant articles. Random effects models were used to estimate pooled complication rates. Meta-regression was performed for each outcome by using mixed effects models with type of hypospadias (primary distal, primary proximal and secondary) as predictors. Results: Of the 189 articles that were identified, 49 studies (4675 patients) were included in the analysis. Fistula and re-operation rates were significantly higher in secondary repairs (15.5% and 23.3%) compared to primary proximal (10.3% and 12.2%) and primary distal (5.7% and 4.5%) (P Z 0.045 and P < 0.001, respectively). Technical modifications reduced fistula rates from 10.3% to 3.3% (P Z 0.003) and re-operation rates from 13.6% to 2.8% (P Z 0.001). The rate of meatal stenosis was highest in the secondary repairs, with follow-up >1 year (12.7%). Comparison of geographical location showed that complication rates for all but one variable were significantly lower in North America when compared to Europe and the rest of the world. Mean meatal stenosis rates were 1.8% in North America, 3.4% in Europe and 8.2% in the rest of the world (P Z 0.002). This remained significant in a multivariable model incorporating repair technique and length of follow-up (P Z 0.046). Mean rates of urethral stricture, fistula and re-operation followed a similar pattern (P Z 0.045, P Z 0.009 and P < 0.001, respectively). Mean follow-up was shortest in the North American group, at 11.9 months, compared to Europe, at 17.8 months, and the rest of the world, at 18.9 months.

P26. Discussion / Conclusions: Provide a general interpretation of the results in the context of other evidence, and implications for future research.
- Quote: ""The complication rates after TIP for proximal and secondary procedures are substantial, and alternative techniques such as the two-stage repair should be considered. North American publications are based on shorter follow-up and it is therefore unsurprising that reported complication rates are lower than Europe and the rest of the world. Finally, additional long-term follow-up papers are required to further evaluate this popular hypospadias technique that has now been in use for 18 years.""

We compared the complication rate of absorbable (Surgisis [SIS]; Cook Biotech, Inc, West Lafayette, IN) and nonabsorbable (polytetrafluoroethylene [PTFE]) materials for this purpose. Methods: This is a retrospective review of all neonates with CDH undergoing patch closure at our institution over 10 years. Meta-analysis was also performed combining our data with the published literature examining the effect of patch type on recurrence and small bowel obstruction (SBO). Results: Primary patch (13 SIS, 9 PTFE) repair was performed in 22 (26%) of 84 patients with CDH. Groups were comparable in terms of demographics, hospital stay, ventilator days, need for high frequency oscillation, age at surgery, and length of follow-up.

We compared the complication rate of absorbable (Surgisis [SIS]; Cook Biotech, Inc, West Lafayette, IN) and nonabsorbable (polytetrafluoroethylene [PTFE]) materials for this purpose. Methods: This is a retrospective review of all neonates with CDH undergoing patch closure at our institution over 10 years. Meta-analysis was also performed combining our data with the published literature examining the effect of patch type on recurrence and small bowel obstruction (SBO). Results: Primary patch (13 SIS, 9 PTFE) repair was performed in 22 (26%) of 84 patients with CDH. Groups were comparable in terms of demographics, hospital stay, ventilator days, need for high frequency oscillation, age at surgery, and length of follow-up. Likewise, recurrence rate (SIS, 4 [31%]; PTFE, 3 [33%]; P, nonsignificant [NS]), incidence of postoperative SBO (SIS, 1 [7%] vs PTFE, 2 [22%]; P, NS), and mortality (SIS, 2 [15%] and PTFE, 2 [22%]; P, NS) were similar.

P2. Abstract / Structured summary: Provide a structured summary including, as applicable: background; objectives; data sources; study eligibility criteria, participants, and interventions; study appraisal and synthesis methods; results; limitations; conclusions and implications of key findings; systematic review registration number.
Quotes: ""Abstract: Background: Single-incision pediatric endosurgery (SIPES) is defined as minimally invasive surgery performed through a unique incision in the abdomen, chest, or retroperitoneum. Several publications exist, but no previous systematic review has been made to evaluate the real benefits of this approach in terms of feasibility and clinical outcomes. Materials and Methods: We performed an electronic search in PubMed up to March 2012 with the terms ‘‘single AND incision OR site OR port OR trocar AND children’’ including related articles and obtained 197 articles. After applying our inclusion criteria, 78 articles were reviewed. Results: We identified prospective controlled trials (n = 1), case-control studies (n = 12), case series (n = 49), and case reports (n = 16). In total, 4212 patients had been operated on by SIPES and were separated by systems: gastrointestinal (n = 2888), urologic (n = 390), gynecologic (n = 27), other abdominal (n = 874), and thoracic (n = 33) procedures. The most common procedure was SIPES appendectomy, and a unique prospective controlled trial supports its safety and effectiveness. Technically demanding surgeries such as hepatojejunostomy and colonic surgeries were described. Multichannel ports and multiple ports, standard and articulated instruments, transparietal instruments, retraction sutures, and magnets were used. Operative times, length of stay, and complications similar to standard laparoscopic surgery were described. A low conversion rate (to a reduced port, standard laparoscopy and open procedures) was also mentioned. No comparable measure for pain and cosmesis assessment was used. Conclusions: A wide experience in SIPES and feasibility has already been described with good clinical outcomes and low rate of conversion. Appendectomy is the unique procedure in which SIPES has been demonstrated to be safe and effective. It is pending the execution of prospective controlled trials for other operations to demonstrate, with objective evidence, the real benefits of this less invasive approach.""

Several designations of this technique have been used with the terms ‘‘incision,’’ ‘‘port,’’ ‘‘site,’’ ‘‘trocar,’’ or ‘‘access,’’ depending on the surgeon’s preference. In the search for less invasive procedures, ever since the development of laparoscopic surgery and with the limitations and equipment dependence of Natural Orifice Translumenal endoscopic surgery (NOTESÒ; American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy [Oak Brook, IL] and Society of American Gastrointestinal and Endoscopic Surgeons [Los Angeles, CA]), this new approach through the umbilicus, a natural embrionary orifice, 1 was first reported in 1992 by Pelosi and Pelosi. 2 Quickly, the literature showed that SIES was a feasible and excellent cosmetic procedure pending the demonstration of its clinical and economic benefits with objective evidence.""

Some SIPES procedures can be performed with the same standard instruments of a conventional three-port laparoscopy in children, meaning no additional cost. Cosmesis seems to be a self-evident benefit of SIPES, although there is no objective assessment of it among authors in the literature, and it must be carefully weighed against the possibility of affecting the safety of the procedure. Experienced endoscopic surgeons might consider SIPES as another surgical approach to treat certain pathologies; however, the execution of prospective controlled trials is pending to demonstrate, with objective evidence, the real benefits of this less invasive approach. Pediatric patients have particular characteristics that allow minimally invasive surgery to be performed safely with the use of hybrid assistance, like reduced ports, stab incisions, and percutaneous retraction sutures. Until the effectiveness of SIPES procedures is proven, we strongly recommend to keep on performing ‘‘minilaparoscopy’’ in our pediatric patients.""

Abstract / Structured summary: Provide a structured summary including, as applicable: background; objectives; data sources; study eligibility criteria, participants, and interventions; study appraisal and synthesis methods; results; limitations; conclusions and implications of key findings; systematic review registration number.
Quotes: ""Abstract: Background: Single-incision pediatric endosurgery (SIPES) is defined as minimally invasive surgery performed through a unique incision in the abdomen, chest, or retroperitoneum. Several publications exist, but no previous systematic review has been made to evaluate the real benefits of this approach in terms of feasibility and clinical outcomes. Materials and Methods: We performed an electronic search in PubMed up to March 2012 with the terms ‘‘single AND incision OR site OR port OR trocar AND children’’ including related articles and obtained 197 articles. After applying our inclusion criteria, 78 articles were reviewed. Results: We identified prospective controlled trials (n = 1), case-control studies (n = 12), case series (n = 49), and case reports (n = 16). In total, 4212 patients had been operated on by SIPES and were separated by systems: gastrointestinal (n = 2888), urologic (n = 390), gynecologic (n = 27), other abdominal (n = 874), and thoracic (n = 33) procedures. The most common procedure was SIPES appendectomy, and a unique prospective controlled trial supports its safety and effectiveness. Technically demanding surgeries such as hepatojejunostomy and colonic surgeries were described. Multichannel ports and multiple ports, standard and articulated instruments, transparietal instruments, retraction sutures, and magnets were used. Operative times, length of stay, and complications similar to standard laparoscopic surgery were described. A low conversion rate (to a reduced port, standard laparoscopy and open procedures) was also mentioned. No comparable measure for pain and cosmesis assessment was used. Conclusions: A wide experience in SIPES and feasibility has already been described with good clinical outcomes and low rate of conversion. Appendectomy is the unique procedure in which SIPES has been demonstrated to be safe and effective. It is pending the execution of prospective controlled trials for other operations to demonstrate, with objective evidence, the real benefits of this less invasive approach.""

Quotes: ""Introduction: Single-incision endosurgery (SIES) is defined as minimally invasive surgery performed through a unique incision in the abdomen, chest, or any other virtual cavity in the human body. Several designations of this technique have been used with the terms ‘‘incision,’’ ‘‘port,’’ ‘‘site,’’ ‘‘trocar,’’ or ‘‘access,’’ depending on the surgeon’s preference. In the search for less invasive procedures, ever since the development of laparoscopic surgery and with the limitations and equipment dependence of Natural Orifice Translumenal endoscopic surgery (NOTESÒ; American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy [Oak Brook, IL] and Society of American Gastrointestinal and Endoscopic Surgeons [Los Angeles, CA]), this new approach through the umbilicus, a natural embrionary orifice, 1 was first reported in 1992 by Pelosi and Pelosi. 2 Quickly, the literature showed that SIES was a feasible and excellent cosmetic procedure pending the demonstration of its clinical and economic benefits with objective evidence.""

Objective The primary objective is to determine the best first-line treatment for pediatric achalasia based on the consolidation of the current literature that compares outcomes after pneumatic dilatation (PD) versus surgical myotomy (Heller esophagomyotomy [HM]). Data Sources A systematic review of English articles using OVID was performed. Study Selection OVID was used to search for articles focusing on the treatment of pediatric esophageal achalasia with PD versus HM. Data Extraction Independent extraction of data was performed by N.E.S using predefined data fields. Data Synthesis Seven articles were included in the systematic review. Techniques of HM and PD varied widely. The best first-line treatment of pediatric achalasia was determined to be HM in two articles, PD in one article, and equal efficacy in one article. Three articles concluded that appropriate initial treatment was determined by the age of the child. Conclusion Adequate comparative data are lacking to determine the ideal treatment of pediatric achalasia. Appropriately designed randomized controlled trials with long-term follow-up are needed to determine ideal treatment algorithms in pediatric achalasia.""

Objective The primary objective is to determine the best first-line treatment for pediatric achalasia based on the consolidation of the current literature that compares outcomes after pneumatic dilatation (PD) versus surgical myotomy (Heller esophagomyotomy [HM]). Data Sources A systematic review of English articles using OVID was performed. Study Selection OVID was used to search for articles focusing on the treatment of pediatric esophageal achalasia with PD versus HM. Data Extraction Independent extraction of data was performed by N.E.S using predefined data fields. Data Synthesis Seven articles were included in the systematic review. Techniques of HM and PD varied widely. The best first-line treatment of pediatric achalasia was determined to be HM in two articles, PD in one article, and equal efficacy in one article. Three articles concluded that appropriate initial treatment was determined by the age of the child.

Quotes: ""Abstract: Objective The laparoscopically-assisted anorectal pull-through (LAARP) for recto-bladderneck and recto-prostatic anorectal malformations (RB/RP-ARMs) is believed to improve patient outcomes. We performed a systematic review of the effect of LAARP on postoperative mucosal prolapse and defecation dysfunction. Methods A comprehensive search of MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL, and grey literature was performed (2000–2014). Full-text screening, data abstraction and quality appraisal were conducted in duplicate. Included studies reported a primary diagnosis of RB/RP-ARM and compared LAARP versus open repair (OPEN). Results From 3681 retrieved articles, 7 studies enrolling 187 patients were analyzed. One was a randomized control trial, 6 were retrospective observational studies, and all were single-centre. The majority were of poor-moderate quality (MINORS scores: mean 16.42 (SD 2.225) out of 24). Mucosal prolapse was not significantly different after LAARP versus OPEN (p = 0.18). Defecation outcomes were inconsistently reported but were no different between LAARP and OPEN for either children [3 years old (p = 0.84), or all ages combined (p = 0.11). Conclusion We found no significant difference in rates of mucosal prolapse or defecation scores for LAARP compared to OPEN for children with RB/RP-ARMs. However, studies are small and of poor-moderate quality and results are heterogeneous. Comprehensive, standardized, reliable reporting is necessary to guide practice and inform post-operative guidelines. Level of evidence 1c.""

Quotes: ""Abstract: Objective The laparoscopically-assisted anorectal pull-through (LAARP) for recto-bladderneck and recto-prostatic anorectal malformations (RB/RP-ARMs) is believed to improve patient outcomes. We performed a systematic review of the effect of LAARP on postoperative mucosal prolapse and defecation dysfunction. Methods A comprehensive search of MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL, and grey literature was performed (2000–2014). Full-text screening, data abstraction and quality appraisal were conducted in duplicate. Included studies reported a primary diagnosis of RB/RP-ARM and compared LAARP versus open repair (OPEN). Results From 3681 retrieved articles, 7 studies enrolling 187 patients were analyzed. One was a randomized control trial, 6 were retrospective observational studies, and all were single-centre. The majority were of poor-moderate quality (MINORS scores: mean 16.42 (SD 2.225) out of 24). Mucosal prolapse was not significantly different after LAARP versus OPEN (p = 0.18). Defecation outcomes were inconsistently reported but were no different between LAARP and OPEN for either children [3 years old (p = 0.84), or all ages combined (p = 0.11). Conclusion We found no significant difference in rates of mucosal prolapse or defecation scores for LAARP compared to OPEN for children with RB/RP-ARMs. However, studies are small and of poor-moderate quality and results are heterogeneous. Comprehensive, standardized, reliable reporting is necessary to guide practice and inform post-operative guidelines. Level of evidence 1c.""

Methods Studies comparing the laparoscopic and the open choledochal cyst excision that met the inclusion criteria for data extraction were identified from electronic databases (PubMed, Embase, Science Citation Index, and the Cochrane Library) up to November 2014. The proceedings of relevant congress were also searched. The outcomes were operative time, intraoperative blood loss, time to food intake, postoperative morbidity and mortality, length of hospital stay. Outcomes were calculated as odds ratios (ORs) with 95 % confidence intervals (CIs) using RevMan 5.2. Results Seven retrospective studies were finally included, involving a total of 1016 patients, of whom, 408 cases underwent laparoscopic cyst excision and Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy (LH) and 608 cases underwent open cyst excision and Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy (OH). In LH group compared with OH group, the operative time was longer (MD = 59.11, 95 % CI 27.61–90.61, P = 0.0002), while the length of postoperative hospital stay was less (MD = -2.01, 95 % CI -2.49 to -1.54, P \ 0.00001), the intraoperative blood loss was lower (MD = -37.14, 95 % CI -66.69 to -7.60, P = 0.01) and time to food intake was less (MD = -1.14, 95 % CI -1.61 to -0.67, P = 0.01). The rate of postoperative morbidity was more in the OH group, but there is no statistically significant difference between the two groups in postoperative morbidity (OR = 0.52, 95 % CI 0.13–2.06, P = 0.35). Conclusion Laparoscopic surgery is a feasible, safe treatment of choledochal cyst with less postoperative morbidity, a shorter length of stay and a lower blood loss when compared with open approach. With the improvement of laparoscopic techniques and deftness of surgeons practice, laparoscopic surgery may become the first choice procedure for choledochal cyst.""

P3. Introduction / Rationale: Describe the rationale for the review in the context of what is already known.
- Quote: ""Choledochal cysts are rare congenital cystic dilations of the biliary tree that present primarily in female infants and young children and are more prevalent in East Asian populations [1, 2]. The exact etiology of choledochal cysts is unknown, but anomalous pancreaticobiliary duct union (APBDU) is seen in 30–70 % of all choledochal cysts where the common bile duct (CBD) and pancreatic duct junction occurs outside the duodenum, allowing reflux of pancreatic fluid into the biliary tree [3]. Besides the classic triad of abdominal pain, right upper quadrant mass and obstructive jaundice, choledochal cysts can be associated with serious complications such as cholangitis, pancreatitis, cholelithiasis and have a high risk in developing cholangiocarcinoma [4]. Thus, total cyst excision followed by Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy reconstruction is recommended for most patients with choledochal cysts whenever possible [5]. Laparoscopic excision of choledochal cysts has increasingly gained acceptance and applicability since its first description by Farello [6]. The potential advantages of LH include shorter recovery time and improved cosmesis. However, its safety remains a major concern compared with the conventional open surgery. Therefore, we conducted this meta-analysis to compare the clinical safety and effectiveness of LH with OH.""

Second, except one study [14], the others did not compare outcomes between the laparoscopic and open group within the same study period, the main drawback in drawing conclusions from different study period is that factors other than the surgical approach, such as changes in perioperative practices or improved equipment, may introduce bias. Third, in some studies, the number of patients was too small, leading to low-power analyses. Caution should be given in the interpretation and generalization of this meta-analysis as the included study numbers are not high and also the overall quantity of these studies is insufficient.

Methods Studies comparing the laparoscopic and the open choledochal cyst excision that met the inclusion criteria for data extraction were identified from electronic databases (PubMed, Embase, Science Citation Index, and the Cochrane Library) up to November 2014. The proceedings of relevant congress were also searched. The outcomes were operative time, intraoperative blood loss, time to food intake, postoperative morbidity and mortality, length of hospital stay. Outcomes were calculated as odds ratios (ORs) with 95 % confidence intervals (CIs) using RevMan 5.2. Results Seven retrospective studies were finally included, involving a total of 1016 patients, of whom, 408 cases underwent laparoscopic cyst excision and Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy (LH) and 608 cases underwent open cyst excision and Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy (OH). In LH group compared with OH group, the operative time was longer (MD = 59.11, 95 % CI 27.61–90.61, P = 0.0002), while the length of postoperative hospital stay was less (MD = -2.01, 95 % CI -2.49 to -1.54, P \ 0.00001), the intraoperative blood loss was lower (MD = -37.14, 95 % CI -66.69 to -7.60, P = 0.01) and time to food intake was less (MD = -1.14, 95 % CI -1.61 to -0.67, P = 0.01). The rate of postoperative morbidity was more in the OH group, but there is no statistically significant difference between the two groups in postoperative morbidity (OR = 0.52, 95 % CI 0.13–2.06, P = 0.35). Conclusion Laparoscopic surgery is a feasible, safe treatment of choledochal cyst with less postoperative morbidity, a shorter length of stay and a lower blood loss when compared with open approach. With the improvement of laparoscopic techniques and deftness of surgeons practice, laparoscopic surgery may become the first choice procedure for choledochal cyst.""

P3. Introduction / Rationale: Describe the rationale for the review in the context of what is already known.
- Quote: ""Choledochal cysts are rare congenital cystic dilations of the biliary tree that present primarily in female infants and young children and are more prevalent in East Asian populations [1, 2]. The exact etiology of choledochal cysts is unknown, but anomalous pancreaticobiliary duct union (APBDU) is seen in 30–70 % of all choledochal cysts where the common bile duct (CBD) and pancreatic duct junction occurs outside the duodenum, allowing reflux of pancreatic fluid into the biliary tree [3]. Besides the classic triad of abdominal pain, right upper quadrant mass and obstructive jaundice, choledochal cysts can be associated with serious complications such as cholangitis, pancreatitis, cholelithiasis and have a high risk in developing cholangiocarcinoma [4]. Thus, total cyst excision followed by Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy reconstruction is recommended for most patients with choledochal cysts whenever possible [5]. Laparoscopic excision of choledochal cysts has increasingly gained acceptance and applicability since its first description by Farello [6]. The potential advantages of LH include shorter recovery time and improved cosmesis. However, its safety remains a major concern compared with the conventional open surgery. Therefore, we conducted this meta-analysis to compare the clinical safety and effectiveness of LH with OH.""

Second, except one study [14], the others did not compare outcomes between the laparoscopic and open group within the same study period, the main drawback in drawing conclusions from different study period is that factors other than the surgical approach, such as changes in perioperative practices or improved equipment, may introduce bias. Third, in some studies, the number of patients was too small, leading to low-power analyses. Caution should be given in the interpretation and generalization of this meta-analysis as the included study numbers are not high and also the overall quantity of these studies is insufficient. At last, heterogeneity among the studies is high.""

P26. Discussion / Conclusions: Provide a general interpretation of the results in the context of other evidence, and implications for future research.
- Quote: ""In conclusion, laparoscopic cyst excision with Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy is a safe and effective treatment option for choledochal cysts in children with comparable outcomes to open resection. LH was associated with a shorter length of postoperative hospital stay and a lower blood loss when compared with open resection. With more refinement in equipment and technique, it will be possible to consider LH as a gold standard for treatment of pediatric choledochal cysts.""

- Quote: ""Abstract: Background: Intestinal intussusception is a frequent cause of bowel obstruction in children. Initial treatment involves pneumatic reduction. If this fails, operative reduction is indicated. There is controversy regarding use of the laparoscopic (LAP) versus the conventional open approach. Patients and Methods: We performed a retrospective review of all children with intussusception who required operative reduction at our institution over a 12-year time period. We also performed a meta-analysis to combine our data with the published literature. Results: We identified 28 patients requiring operative intervention for reduction of intussusception between January 2000 and April 2012. Five patients underwent LAP reduction, and 23 patients underwent open reduction. Operative times were not statistically different. The rate of overall complications was not statistically different, with 1 of 5 (20%) and 7 of 23 (30%) having complications in the LAP and open groups, respectively. Mean length of stay was 3.8 – 2.1 days in both the LAP and open groups, with no significant difference. Our meta-analysis identified five retrospective studies comparing LAP and open techniques for reduction of intussusception. We did not find a significant difference between groups with respect to operative time, overall complication rates, or re-operation rates. However, the length of hospital stay was significantly longer in the open group. Conclusions: LAP reduction of intussusception is a safe and feasible alternative to the open approach. Length of stay may be shorter in the LAP group.""

- Quote: ""Abstract: Background: Intestinal intussusception is a frequent cause of bowel obstruction in children. Initial treatment involves pneumatic reduction. If this fails, operative reduction is indicated. There is controversy regarding use of the laparoscopic (LAP) versus the conventional open approach. Patients and Methods: We performed a retrospective review of all children with intussusception who required operative reduction at our institution over a 12-year time period. We also performed a meta-analysis to combine our data with the published literature. Results: We identified 28 patients requiring operative intervention for reduction of intussusception between January 2000 and April 2012. Five patients underwent LAP reduction, and 23 patients underwent open reduction. Operative times were not statistically different. The rate of overall complications was not statistically different, with 1 of 5 (20%) and 7 of 23 (30%) having complications in the LAP and open groups, respectively. Mean length of stay was 3.8 – 2.1 days in both the LAP and open groups, with no significant difference. Our meta-analysis identified five retrospective studies comparing LAP and open techniques for reduction of intussusception. We did not find a significant difference between groups with respect to operative time, overall complication rates, or re-operation rates. However, the length of hospital stay was significantly longer in the open group. Conclusions: LAP reduction of intussusception is a safe and feasible alternative to the open approach. Length of stay may be shorter in the LAP group.""

In this review, we aim to elucidate the aspects of LESS for major urological procedures in the pediatric population. Materials and methods: An in-depth search of the literature was performed in the databases of PubMed and Scopus, for studies investigating the technical aspects and clinical outcomes of partial nephrec- tomies, nephrectomies, nephroureterectomies, varicocelectomies and pyeloplasties in children. Data on parameters such as operation time, instrumentation, perioperative complications, hospital stay and follow up period were collected and further analyzed cumulatively. Results: Twenty nine studies met the inclusion criteria incorporating 386 patients who underwent 401 procedures. There were no major intraoperative complications, with only 19 patients (4.73%) facing postoperative complications. No perioperative deaths were reported. Conclusions: In the hands of experienced surgeons LESS seems a feasible, efficient and less invasive alternative to standard laparoscopy in the field of pediatric urology.

In this review, we aim to elucidate the aspects of LESS for major urological procedures in the pediatric population. Materials and methods: An in-depth search of the literature was performed in the databases of PubMed and Scopus, for studies investigating the technical aspects and clinical outcomes of partial nephrec- tomies, nephrectomies, nephroureterectomies, varicocelectomies and pyeloplasties in children. Data on parameters such as operation time, instrumentation, perioperative complications, hospital stay and follow up period were collected and further analyzed cumulatively. Results: Twenty nine studies met the inclusion criteria incorporating 386 patients who underwent 401 procedures. There were no major intraoperative complications, with only 19 patients (4.73%) facing postoperative complications. No perioperative deaths were reported. Conclusions: In the hands of experienced surgeons LESS seems a feasible, efficient and less invasive alternative to standard laparoscopy in the field of pediatric urology.

- Quote: ""Abstract: Introduction: Radical nephrectomy (RN, or total nephrectomy) is the current gold-standard surgical treatment for children with Wilms tumors (WT). However, nephron-sparing surgery (NSS, or partial nephrectomy) has recently been gaining increasing attention. The objective of this systematic review is to compare the effectiveness of NSS as compared with RN for the treatment of children with WT. Methods: We searched the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, clinicaltrials.gov, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Google Scholar, and recently presented meeting abstracts for reports in English. The bibliographies of included studies were then hand-searched for any missed articles. The protocol was prospectively registered. Manuscripts were assessed and data abstracted in duplicate with differences resolved by the senior author. Owing to high heterogeneity among the final included studies, only a qualitative systematic review was performed; no formal meta-analysis was undertaken. Results: We identified 694 articles, 118 of which were selected for full-text review and 66 of which were included in the final analysis. Most studies were single- or multi-institution retrospective case series (60, 91%), with a small number of prospective cohort studies (6, 9%) and 1 administrative database analysis. Most studies were from Europe (27, 41%) or North America (21, 32%). Nearly half (32, 48%) of studies those were included were dated from 2010 or later. In total, data on 4,002 patients were included, of whom 1,040 (26%) underwent NSS and 2,962 (74%) underwent NSS. Reported rupture rates were similar between RN and NSS (13% vs. 7%), as were recurrence rates (12% vs. 11%) and survival rates (85% vs. 88%). However, these comparisons are limited by inherent biases in the design and reporting of most included studies. Conclusions: Most contemporary studies reporting the use of NSS in children with WT report similar long-term outcomes to RN. However, most existing studies are limited by their small numbers, inconsistent reporting, and methodological biases. There are significant opportunities for future research on the use of NSS in children with WT, including issues related to surgical quality, optimal technique, timing and duration of chemotherapy, and variation in the use of NSS among centers. r 2016 Elsevier Inc.

P3. Introduction / Rationale: Describe the rationale for the review in the context of what is already known.
- Quote: ""Introduction: Wilms tumor (WT) is the most common solid renal malignancy in children; the estimated annual incidence rate is 7 to 10 cases per million for children younger than 15 years. The Children's Oncology Group (COG) identifies approximately 600 children per year in the United States with a renal tumor, more than 90% of which are WT. Bilateral WT are relatively uncommon, accounting for 5% to 7% of children with renal tumors [1,2]. Multimodality therapy, including radical nephrectomy (RN) via a transperitoneal approach is the mainstay of WT management [3]. Historically, nephron-sparing surgery (NSS) was generally reserved for bilateral WT or children with a solitary kidney in whom preservation of renal function was mandatory [4].""

Methods: We searched the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, clinicaltrials.gov, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Google Scholar, and recently presented meeting abstracts for reports in English. The bibliographies of included studies were then hand-searched for any missed articles. The protocol was prospectively registered. Manuscripts were assessed and data abstracted in duplicate with differences resolved by the senior author. Owing to high heterogeneity among the final included studies, only a qualitative systematic review was performed; no formal meta-analysis was undertaken. Results: We identified 694 articles, 118 of which were selected for full-text review and 66 of which were included in the final analysis. Most studies were single- or multi-institution retrospective case series (60, 91%), with a small number of prospective cohort studies (6, 9%) and 1 administrative database analysis. Most studies were from Europe (27, 41%) or North America (21, 32%). Nearly half (32, 48%) of studies those were included were dated from 2010 or later. In total, data on 4,002 patients were included, of whom 1,040 (26%) underwent NSS and 2,962 (74%) underwent NSS. Reported rupture rates were similar between RN and NSS (13% vs. 7%), as were recurrence rates (12% vs. 11%) and survival rates (85% vs. 88%). However, these comparisons are limited by inherent biases in the design and reporting of most included studies. Conclusions: Most contemporary studies reporting the use of NSS in children with WT report similar long-term outcomes to RN. However, most existing studies are limited by their small numbers, inconsistent reporting, and methodological biases. There are significant opportunities for future research on the use of NSS in children with WT, including issues related to surgical quality, optimal technique, timing and duration of chemotherapy, and variation in the use of NSS among centers. r 2016 Elsevier Inc.

P3. Introduction / Rationale: Describe the rationale for the review in the context of what is already known.
- Quote: ""Introduction: Wilms tumor (WT) is the most common solid renal malignancy in children; the estimated annual incidence rate is 7 to 10 cases per million for children younger than 15 years. The Children's Oncology Group (COG) identifies approximately 600 children per year in the United States with a renal tumor, more than 90% of which are WT. Bilateral WT are relatively uncommon, accounting for 5% to 7% of children with renal tumors [1,2]. Multimodality therapy, including radical nephrectomy (RN) via a transperitoneal approach is the mainstay of WT management [3]. Historically, nephron-sparing surgery (NSS) was generally reserved for bilateral WT or children with a solitary kidney in whom preservation of renal function was mandatory [4].""

Quotes: ""Abstract: Introduction The aim of this article is to identify the ideal type and location of colostomy in children with colorectal disease. Patients and Methods A retrospective case study of children with an anorectal malformation who received a colostomy, born between January 1990 and July 2012. Furthermore, a systematic literature search on colostomies in neonates with an anorectal malformation or Hirschsprung disease. Colostomies were classified as loop or split colostomies in the transverse or sigmoid colon. Outcome measures were mortality and complications such as prolapse, technical difficulties with the reconstruction, urinary tract infections, and others. Results The mortality rate in the 180 children with anorectal malformation was 6%, and none of them were directly related to stoma formation or closure. The overall complication rate was 23% and the specific rates for the two types of procedures and the two locations of the colostomy did not differ (p ¼ 0.389 and p ¼ 0.667, respectively). All prolapses (n ¼ 22) occurred in loop colostomies in the transverse colon. One colostomy required revision because of insufficient length for the reconstruction. Urinary tract infections were not documented. A total of eight studies were included in the systematic review (1982–2011; 2,954 patients). Mortality ranged between 0.1 and 11%. Loop colostomies had more complications than split colostomies (63 vs. 45%; p ¼ 0.007), mainly prolapse (18 vs. 6%; p < 0.001). Overall complication rate differed between transverse en sigmoid colostomies (62 vs. 51%, p ¼ 0.006), and prolapse occurred more often in the transverse colon (23 vs. 7%; p < 0.001). Revision because of insufficient length during the reconstruction was needed in 0 to 6%. Two studies reported on urinary tract infections which are as follows: One showed no difference between loop or split colostomies, whereas the other showed frequent episodes of urinary tract infections in 64% of the loop colostomies. Conclusions The complication to be avoided in transverse colostomies is prolapse and the surgical technique should be modified accordingly. The procedure of split sigmoid colostomy is meticulous, and the risk of insufficient length for the reconstruction remains.""

Response: [Yes]

P3. Introduction / Rationale: Describe the rationale for the review in the context of what is already known.
Quotes: ""Anorectal malformations and Hirschsprung disease are congenital malformations that show a wide clinical variety. In children with a high anorectal malformation, a colostomy is constructed in the neonatal period when direct reconstruction in the first few days of life is not possible. The colostomy is closed after reconstructive surgery later in life. In children with Hirschsprung disease, a stoma is formed if the bowel cannot be decompressed with the use of rectal washouts. The stoma is closed after the aganglionic bowel has been resected and a pull-through procedure has been performed.""

Quotes: ""Abstract: Introduction The aim of this article is to identify the ideal type and location of colostomy in children with colorectal disease. Patients and Methods A retrospective case study of children with an anorectal malformation who received a colostomy, born between January 1990 and July 2012. Furthermore, a systematic literature search on colostomies in neonates with an anorectal malformation or Hirschsprung disease. Colostomies were classified as loop or split colostomies in the transverse or sigmoid colon. Outcome measures were mortality and complications such as prolapse, technical difficulties with the reconstruction, urinary tract infections, and others. Results The mortality rate in the 180 children with anorectal malformation was 6%, and none of them were directly related to stoma formation or closure. The overall complication rate was 23% and the specific rates for the two types of procedures and the two locations of the colostomy did not differ (p ¼ 0.389 and p ¼ 0.667, respectively). All prolapses (n ¼ 22) occurred in loop colostomies in the transverse colon. One colostomy required revision because of insufficient length for the reconstruction. Urinary tract infections were not documented. A total of eight studies were included in the systematic review (1982–2011; 2,954 patients). Mortality ranged between 0.1 and 11%. Loop colostomies had more complications than split colostomies (63 vs. 45%; p ¼ 0.007), mainly prolapse (18 vs. 6%; p < 0.001). Overall complication rate differed between transverse en sigmoid colostomies (62 vs. 51%, p ¼ 0.006), and prolapse occurred more often in the transverse colon (23 vs. 7%; p < 0.001). Revision because of insufficient length during the reconstruction was needed in 0 to 6%. Two studies reported on urinary tract infections which are as follows: One showed no difference between loop or split colostomies, whereas the other showed frequent episodes of urinary tract infections in 64% of the loop colostomies. Conclusions The complication to be avoided in transverse colostomies is prolapse and the surgical technique should be modified accordingly. The procedure of split sigmoid colostomy is meticulous, and the risk of insufficient length for the reconstruction remains.""

Response: [Yes]

P3. Introduction / Rationale: Describe the rationale for the review in the context of what is already known.
Quotes: ""Anorectal malformations and Hirschsprung disease are congenital malformations that show a wide clinical variety. In children with a high anorectal malformation, a colostomy is constructed in the neonatal period when direct reconstruction in the first few days of life is not possible. The colostomy is closed after reconstructive surgery later in life. In children with Hirschsprung disease, a stoma is formed if the bowel cannot be decompressed with the use of rectal washouts. The stoma is closed after the aganglionic bowel has been resected and a pull-through procedure has been performed.""

Methods: For this meta-analysis, the Medline (1990e2009), Embase (1990e2009) and Cochrane databases were searched using the keyword ‘hypospadias’. Inclusion criteria were: i) primary repairs; ii) distal hypospadias; iii) paediatric case series; iv) standard Mathieu and TIP techniques; v) complication data obtainable from the paper. Cases were only included in the denominator for each complication if explicitly identified in the paper. Fisher’s exact was used for statistical analysis, with P < 0.05 considered significant. Main results: 129 papers were selected for full analysis; 23 papers met the inclusion criteria comprising 1872 TIP repairs and 1496 Mathieu repairs. We identified an increased incidence of urethral fistulae with the Mathieu technique (3.8% vs 5.3%, P Z 0.028); however, this is lost on subgroup analysis. An increased incidence of meatal stenosis was identified in the TIP group (3.1% vs 0.7%, P < 0.001). Conclusions: There is no clear consensus on the ideal method of repair for distal hypospadias. Both the Mathieu and TIP techniques have been shown to have low rates of postoperative complications. Comparison between series is difficult because of a lack of consistency in reporting complications and follow up. We advocate uniform standards for reporting outcomes of hypospadias.""

Considerable debate exists regarding the benefits of LH over conventional open herniorrhaphy (OH). The aim of this review was to critique the current literature to determine the efficacy of LH. Methods: Published studies until July 30, 2010, were searched from Medline, Embase, Ovid, Web of Science, and Cochrane databases. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and observational clinical studies (OCSs) with a comparison of LH and OH were included. A systemic review and meta-analysis were performed using the odds ratios (ORs) for dichotomous variables and weighted mean differences (WMDs) for continuous variables. Results: Of 138 studies, 3 RCTs and 4 OCSs were eligible for inclusion criteria, comprising 1543 cases of LH and 657 cases of OH. Compared with OH, shorter operative time for bilateral hernias (WMD = −11.14; 95% confidence interval [CI], −20.61 to −1.68; P = .02) and lower rate of metachronic contralateral hernia (OR, 0.26; 95% CI, 0.09-0.76; P = .01) were noted in LH. However, no significant difference was observed between LH and OH in patients' age, sex, affected side, operative time for unilateral hernias, duration of hospital stay, time to resume full activity, recurrence, and complications. Conclusions: Laparoscopic herniorrhaphy is superior to OH in the repair of bilateral PIH and lower rate of metachronic contralateral hernia, with similar operative time for unilateral hernias, length of hospital stay, recurrence, and complication rates. Because of the publishing bias, a series of RCTs with standard report format and uniform unit are necessary to explore the efficiencies of LH in the management of PIH.""

P3. Introduction / Rationale: Describe the rationale for the review in the context of what is already known.
- Quote: ""Inguinal hernias, one of the inguinoscrotal abnormalities because of failure to close the processus vaginalis, are common conditions of infancy and childhood [1]. Herniotomy is the standard procedure for pediatric inguinal hernia (PIH), with a high success rate and low rate of complications [2]. The principle for the repair of PIH is the complete ligation of patent processus vaginalis [3]. Some patients develop hernia on the opposite side after surgical repair, which is known as metachronous contralateral inguinal hernia (MCIH) [4]. Recurrence after an open procedure may be attributed to a failure to ligate the sac high enough at the internal ring, injury to the floor of inguinal canal because of operative trauma, failure to close the internal ring in girls, or postoperative wound infection and hematoma [5]. Therefore, contralateral exploration and postoperative hernia recurrence remain the major problems of conventional open herniorrhaphy (OH) in children with an indirect hernia [5]. In addition, injury to the reproductive system is the most frequent causes of infertility because of childhood inguinal herniorrhaphy [6]. Thus, it remains one of the duties for pediatric surgeons to improve the treatment of inguinal hernias.""

Quote: ""a b s t r a c t a r t i c l e i n f o Article history: Received 19 January 2016 Accepted 7 February 2016 Key words: Gastroschisis Systematic review Meta-analysis Flap closure Background: Flap closure represents an alternative to fascial closure for gastroschisis. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of outcomes comparing these techniques. Methods: A registered systematic review (PROSPERO: CRD42015016745) of comparative studies was performed, querying multiple databases without language or date restrictions. Gray literature was sought. Outcomes analyzed included: mortality, ventilation days, feeding parameters, length of stay (LOS), wound infection, resource utilization, and umbilical hernia incidence. Multiple reviewers independently assessed study eligibility and literature quality. Meta-analysis of outcomes was performed where appropriate (Revman 5.2). Results: Twelve studies met inclusion criteria, of which three were multi-institutional. Quality assessment revealed unbiased patient selection and exposure, but group comparability was suboptimal in four studies. Over- all, 1124 patients were evaluated, of which 350 underwent flap closure (210 immediately; 140 post-silo). Meta- analysis revealed no significant differences in mortality, LOS, or feeding parameters between groups. Flap patients had less wound infections (OR 0.40 [95%CI 0.22–0.74], P = 0.003). While flap patients had an increased risk of umbilical hernia, they were less likely to undergo repair (19% vs. 41%; P = 0.01). Conclusions: Flap closure has equivalent or superior outcomes to fascial closure for patients with gastroschisis. Given potential advantages of bedside closure and reduced sedation requirements, flap closure may represent the preferred closure strategy.""

Quote: ""Gastroschisis (GS) is a congenital full thickness defect of the ab- dominal wall that is increasing in prevalence worldwide [1,2]. Although the survival rate of neonates with GS is high, the burden of survivor morbidity remains considerable [3]. Various techniques have been described to close the defect, with the two most common methods being an operative fascial closure with sutures and a non- operative sutureless ‘flap’ closure [4].""

Outcomes analyzed included: mortality, ventilation days, feeding parameters, length of stay (LOS), wound infection, resource utilization, and umbilical hernia incidence. Multiple reviewers independently assessed study eligibility and literature quality. Meta-analysis of outcomes was performed where appropriate (Revman 5.2). Results: Twelve studies met inclusion criteria, of which three were multi-institutional. Quality assessment revealed unbiased patient selection and exposure, but group comparability was suboptimal in four studies. Over- all, 1124 patients were evaluated, of which 350 underwent flap closure (210 immediately; 140 post-silo). Meta- analysis revealed no significant differences in mortality, LOS, or feeding parameters between groups. Flap patients had less wound infections (OR 0.40 [95%CI 0.22–0.74], P = 0.003). While flap patients had an increased risk of umbilical hernia, they were less likely to undergo repair (19% vs. 41%; P = 0.01). Conclusions: Flap closure has equivalent or superior outcomes to fascial closure for patients with gastroschisis. Given potential advantages of bedside closure and reduced sedation requirements, flap closure may represent the preferred closure strategy.""

Response: [Yes]

P3. Introduction / Rationale: Describe the rationale for the review in the context of what is already known.
Quote: ""Gastroschisis (GS) is a congenital full thickness defect of the ab- dominal wall that is increasing in prevalence worldwide [1,2]. Although the survival rate of neonates with GS is high, the burden of survivor morbidity remains considerable [3]. Various techniques have been described to close the defect, with the two most common methods being an operative fascial closure with sutures and a non- operative sutureless ‘flap’ closure [4].""

Methods A literature search was performed using the PubMed database, Embase, and the Cochrane central register of controlled trials using a defined set of criteria. The outcomes, which include post-operative mortality, incidence of hernia recurrence, rates of patch use and complications, were analyzed. Results We investigated nine studies, which included 507 patients. All studies were non-randomized historical control trials. The MIS group had a significantly lower rate of post-operative death with a risk ratio of 0.26 [95 % confidence interval (CI) 0.10–0.68; p = 0.006] but a greater incidence of hernia recurrence with a risk ratio of 3.42 (95 % CI 1.98–5.88; p \ 0.00001). Rates of prosthetic patch use were similar between the two groups. Fewer cases of surgical complications were found in the MIS group with a risk ratio of 0.66 (95 % CI 0.47–0.94; p = 0.02). Conclusions MIS for CDH repair is associated with lower post-operative mortality and morbidity compared with traditional open repair. Although rate of patch use appears to be comparable, the increased risk of CDH recurrence should not be ignored. The lack of well-controlled prospective trials still limits strong evaluations of the two surgical techniques.""

Response: [Yes]

P25. Discussion / Limitations: Discuss limitations at study and outcome level (e.g., risk of bias), and at review-level (e.g., incomplete retrieval of identified research, reporting bias).
Quotes: ""This study was challenging due to a number of limitations in the existing literature: Studies assessing the effectiveness of surgical options for obesity in children and adolescents were (apart from one randomized controlled trial) either retrospective or observational, and systematically underpowered. Sample sizes were generally small, with the largest sample containing only 68 patients and the majority of studies reporting data on fewer than 40 patients. Results were not broadly comparable given a lack of consistency across surgeons, procedures and reported outcomes. Accurate information for low frequency outcomes like mortality and complications was sparse. No studies on clinical effectiveness reported on costs, and only one study addressed bariatric surgery cost in children.""
Reasoning: The authors discuss the limitations of the study, including the quality of the included studies, small sample sizes, and lack of cost data.
Response: [Yes]

P26. Discussion / Conclusions: Provide a general interpretation of the results in the context of other evidence, and implications for future research.
Quotes: ""In the context of a general lack of effective tools for primary prevention or behavioural treatment of obesity, surgical treatment may be advocated as a preferred and cost-effective solution for certain children and adolescents. However, postoperative complications, compliance and follow-up may be more problematic in adolescents than adults, and availability of long-term data on safety, effectiveness and cost-effectiveness remains largely unknown. Pending an improvement in the quality of available evidence, an academic approach to child and adolescent bariatric surgery is warranted, and reversible techniques are advisable compared to approaches that permanently alter the anatomy.""

P25. Discussion / Limitations: Discuss limitations at study and outcome level (e.g., risk of bias), and at review-level (e.g., incomplete retrieval of identified research, reporting bias).
Quotes: ""This study was challenging due to a number of limitations in the existing literature: Studies assessing the effectiveness of surgical options for obesity in children and adolescents were (apart from one randomized controlled trial) either retrospective or observational, and systematically underpowered. Sample sizes were generally small, with the largest sample containing only 68 patients and the majority of studies reporting data on fewer than 40 patients. Results were not broadly comparable given a lack of consistency across surgeons, procedures and reported outcomes. Accurate information for low frequency outcomes like mortality and complications was sparse. No studies on clinical effectiveness reported on costs, and only one study addressed bariatric surgery cost in children.""

P26. Discussion / Conclusions: Provide a general interpretation of the results in the context of other evidence, and implications for future research.
Quotes: ""In the context of a general lack of effective tools for primary prevention or behavioural treatment of obesity, surgical treatment may be advocated as a preferred and cost-effective solution for certain children and adolescents. However, postoperative complications, compliance and follow-up may be more problematic in adolescents than adults, and availability of long-term data on safety, effectiveness and cost-effectiveness remains largely unknown. Pending an improvement in the quality of available evidence, an academic approach to child and adolescent bariatric surgery is warranted, and reversible techniques are advisable compared to approaches that permanently alter the anatomy.""

Relative merits of each are unclear. Methods: A systematic review and meta-analysis was performed comparing outcomes following OPFC and SR in infants with simple gastroschisis. Primary outcomes of interest were mortality, length of hospitalization and time to full enteral feeding. Results: 751 unique articles were identified. Eight met the inclusion criteria. None were randomized controlled trials. 488 infants underwent OPFC and 316 underwent SR. Multiple studies were excluded because they included heterogeneous populations and mixed intervention groups. Length of stay was significantly longer in the SR group (mean difference 8.97 days, 95% CI 2.14–15.80 days), as was number of post-operative days to complete enteral feeding (mean difference 7.19 days, 95%CI 2.01–12.36 days). Mortality was not statistically significantly different, although the odds of death were raised in the SR group (OR 1.96, 95%CI 0.71–5.35). Conclusions: Despite showing some benefit of OPFC over SR, our results are tempered by the low quality of the available studies, which were small and variably reported. Coordinating research through a National Paediatric Surgical Trials Unit could alleviate many of these problems. A similar national approach could be used in other smaller surgical specialties.""

P3. Introduction / Rationale: Describe the rationale for the review in the context of what is already known.
Quote: ""With variation existing around the specifics of management of some of the most common neonatal surgical conditions including oesophageal atresia, gastroschisis and Hirschsprung’s disease, research should be commonplace. Yet despite these fertile conditions for research, for these three conditions, only fourteen prospectively registered clinical trials and two systematic reviews could be identified on a search of the major registries at the time of writing (Table 1). Whilst both the low incidence of many of the studied conditions, and the difficulties in gaining ethical approval are at least in part responsible for the lack of paediatric surgical research, we do not believe that they account for the whole story.""

Response: [Yes]

P4. Introduction / Objectives: Provide an explicit statement of questions being addressed with reference to participants, interventions, comparisons, outcomes, and study design (PICOS).

The application of Mitomycin C to the site of stricture has been introduced, but the experience with this novel approach remains very limited. Methods Systematic review of publications on the topical application of Mitomycin C in children with persistent esophageal stricture. Results We identified 11 publications including 31 cases. The underlying cause of stricture was caustic ingestion in 19 (61.2%), esophageal surgery in 7 (22.6%), and others in 5 children (16.2%). The median age of the patients was 48 months (range 4 to 276 months). In the majority of cases cotton pledgets soaked in solution of Mitomycin C were applied endoscopically. Various other techniques such as drug-eluting stents were used. Mitomycin C was applied from 1 to 12 times within intervals from 1 to 12 weeks. The concentrations of Mitomycin C varied considerably between 0.1 and 1 mg/mL. After a mean follow-up time of 22 (6 to 60) months complete relief of symptoms was reported for 21 children (67.7%), and 6 (19.4%) had a partial relief. In four children (12.9%) Mitomycin C treatment failed. No direct or indirect adverse effects were reported. Conclusion The short-term results of topical Mitomycin C application for refractory esophageal stricture reported in the literature are very encouraging. Prospective studies are mandatory to determine the optimal time points, dosage, and modalities of treatment before a recommendation can be given.""

Quotes: ""Abstract & Introduction: The laparoscopic treatment of pediatric populations remains controversial. This review was conducted to compare the clinical and cost effectiveness of laparoscopic and open surgical approaches for a variety of surgical indications in pediatric populations. Method/ Design: A computerized comprehensive search supplemented by a manual review of the literature was performed for all peer-reviewed publications comparing laparoscopic and open appendectomy, fundoplication and hernia repair cohorts. Outcomes of interest were length of stay (LOS), operating room (OR) time, complication rates and total hospital costs; aggregation of outcome rates was performed with the Mantel-Haenszel method. Results: A total of 24 articles were identified that met the search and inclusion criteria. LOS was found to be significantly reduced in favor of the laparoscopic approach, with a weighted mean difference of − 1.44 days, although the OR time was significantly increased, with a weighted mean difference of + 12.8 min. Laparoscopic intervention was associated with a significantly reduced complication rate compared to the open approach (10.6 vs. 15.6 % ). Total hospital costs of the laparoscopic approaches were found to be insignificantly increased compared to the open techniques. Conclusion: This review further supports the use of minimally invasive surgery (MIS) in pediatric populations, demonstrating that the three types laparoscopic procedures reviewed resulted in better patient outcomes compared to open procedures, in the form of reduced LOS and overall complication rates. Increased utilization of this approach may prove beneficial to pediatric patients.""

Quotes: ""Abstract & Introduction: The laparoscopic treatment of pediatric populations remains controversial. This review was conducted to compare the clinical and cost effectiveness of laparoscopic and open surgical approaches for a variety of surgical indications in pediatric populations. Method/ Design: A computerized comprehensive search supplemented by a manual review of the literature was performed for all peer-reviewed publications comparing laparoscopic and open appendectomy, fundoplication and hernia repair cohorts. Outcomes of interest were length of stay (LOS), operating room (OR) time, complication rates and total hospital costs; aggregation of outcome rates was performed with the Mantel-Haenszel method. Results: A total of 24 articles were identified that met the search and inclusion criteria. LOS was found to be significantly reduced in favor of the laparoscopic approach, with a weighted mean difference of − 1.44 days, although the OR time was significantly increased, with a weighted mean difference of + 12.8 min. Laparoscopic intervention was associated with a significantly reduced complication rate compared to the open approach (10.6 vs. 15.6 % ). Total hospital costs of the laparoscopic approaches were found to be insignificantly increased compared to the open techniques. Conclusion: This review further supports the use of minimally invasive surgery (MIS) in pediatric populations, demonstrating that the three types laparoscopic procedures reviewed resulted in better patient outcomes compared to open procedures, in the form of reduced LOS and overall complication rates. Increased utilization of this approach may prove beneficial to pediatric patients.""

Quotes: ""The validity of the results of this review largely depends on the validity of the included studies. Many of the included studies failed to take all the steps necessary to avoid bias. There may well be an inherent bias in the analyses, which are likely to favor the ‘newer’ MIS/laparoscopic technique. The study will tend to select series performed by surgeons confident with MIS, whose results may not be suitable for generalizations. Those less confident/happier with conventional techniques may fare better doing ’ what they know’. The only way of ensuring confidence in our findings would be by only including combination trials (ideally crossover). Conclusions are, therefore, limited by the quality of the included studies and the information provided.""

The aim of this study was to identify clinical evidence about the reliability of this technique in the recent literature. Methods: We performed a Medline search for articles published during the last 10 years, using the key words “varicocele,” “treatment,” and “adolescent.” As limits, we used last 10 years, adolescent, clinical trials, randomized controlled trials, meta-analysis, and multicenter retrospective and prospective studies. The results were investigated in recurrence and hydrocele formation. Results: We pooled 37 studies, but 26 of these were excluded because they were neither relevant nor concerned an adolescent population. Meta-analysis showed that there was no statistical difference between laparoscopic surgery and open surgery in recurrence rate and postoperative hydrocele rate. In the laparoscopic group, the incidence of recurrence was higher in the patients undergoing artery ligation compared to patients undergoing artery and venous ligation. Furthermore, a lower rate of postoperative hydrocele was recorded in patients undergoing dye injections before laparoscopic ligation. Conclusions: Meta-analysis and literature analysis showed that the results after laparoscopic varicocelectomy are comparable to other surgical procedures. The laparoscopic approach has the advantage to treat simultaneously bilateral varicocele.""

- Quote: ""Abstract The ideal management of cryptorchidism is a highly debated topic within the field of pediatric surgery. The optimal timing of orchiopexy is particularly unclear, as existing literature reports mixed recommendations. The aim of this study was to determine, based on a systematic review, the most favorable age at which orchiopexy should be performed. We conducted a systematic search of MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, and the Cochrane Library to find relevant articles. Two researchers quality assessed each study using the following tools: AMSTAR (systematic reviews), Jadad (RCTs), and MINORS (non-RCTs). We developed a conclusion based on the highest quality studies. We found one relevant systematic review, one RCT, and 30 non-RCTs. Fertility potential was greatest when orchiopexy was performed before 1 year of age. Additionally, orchiopexy before 10–11 years may protect against the increased risk of testicular cancer associated with cryptorchidism. Orchiopexy should not be performed before 6 months of age, as testes may descend spontaneously during the first few months of life. The highest quality evidence recommends orchiopexy between 6 and 12 months of age.

Abstract / Structured summary: Provide a structured summary including, as applicable: background; objectives; data sources; study eligibility criteria, participants, and interventions; study appraisal and synthesis methods; results; limitations; conclusions and implications of key findings; systematic review registration number.
- Quote: ""Abstract: Aim: Transanal endorectal pull-through (TERPT) has become popular for single-stage treatment of Hirschsprung's disease. The benefits of TERPT over the conventional transabdominal approach (TAB) are still unclear. We performed a comprehensive meta-analysis comparing the clinical outcomes of TERPT and TAB. Methods: Original articles published from 1998 to 2012 were searched from Medline, Embase, and Cochrane databases. Randomized controlled trials (RCT) and observational clinical studies (OCS) comparing TERPT and TAB were included. Outcomes evaluated included operative time, hospital stay and incidence of postoperative incontinence/soiling, constipation and enterocolitis. Pooled odds ratios (OR) were calculated for dichotomous variables; pooled mean differences (MD) were measured for continuous variables. Results: Of 93 studies, 1 RCT and 11 OCS were included, comprising 444 cases of TERPT and 348 cases of TAB (215 Soave, 94 Duhamel, 24 Swenson, 15 Rehbein procedures). TERPT had shorter operative time (MD = −57.85 min; 95% confidence interval [CI], −83.11 to − 32.60; P b 0.00001) and hospital stay (MD = −7.06 days; 95% CI, −10.95 to −3.16; P = 0.0004). TERPT had less postoperative incontinence/ soiling (OR = 0.58; 95% CI 0.37–0.90; P = 0.01) and constipation (OR = 0.49; 95% CI 0.30–0.81; P = 0.005). There was no difference in incidence of postoperative enterocolitis. Conclusion: TERPT is superior to TAB in operative time, hospital stay, postoperative incontinence and constipation. However, more randomized controlled trials are necessary to verify the benefit of TERPT for Hirschsprung's disease.""

The benefits of TERPT over the conventional transabdominal approach (TAB) are still unclear. We performed a comprehensive meta-analysis comparing the clinical outcomes of TERPT and TAB. Methods: Original articles published from 1998 to 2012 were searched from Medline, Embase, and Cochrane databases. Randomized controlled trials (RCT) and observational clinical studies (OCS) comparing TERPT and TAB were included. Outcomes evaluated included operative time, hospital stay and incidence of postoperative incontinence/soiling, constipation and enterocolitis. Pooled odds ratios (OR) were calculated for dichotomous variables; pooled mean differences (MD) were measured for continuous variables. Results: Of 93 studies, 1 RCT and 11 OCS were included, comprising 444 cases of TERPT and 348 cases of TAB (215 Soave, 94 Duhamel, 24 Swenson, 15 Rehbein procedures). TERPT had shorter operative time (MD = −57.85 min; 95% confidence interval [CI], −83.11 to − 32.60; P b 0.00001) and hospital stay (MD = −7.06 days; 95% CI, −10.95 to −3.16; P = 0.0004). TERPT had less postoperative incontinence/ soiling (OR = 0.58; 95% CI 0.37–0.90; P = 0.01) and constipation (OR = 0.49; 95% CI 0.30–0.81; P = 0.005).

Materials and Methods: Studies published since 1992 that compared SILA versus TILA in laparoscopic appendicectomy were collected. Data on operative parameters, postoperative recovery, postoperative pain and complications, and hospitalization costs for SILA and TILA were meta-analyzed using fixed-effect and random-effect models. Results: Seventeen studies (1 randomized controlled trial and 16 retrospective studies) that included 1809 patients were studied. Of these patients, 793 and 1016 had undergone SILA and TILA, respectively. There was significantly shorter length of hospital stay; however, there were evidently higher conversion rate, and perhaps higher surgical difficulty and hospitalization costs for SILA compared with TILA. Other outcome variables such as operative time, blood loss, time to first oral intake, postoperative pain and complications were not found to be statistically significant for either group. Conclusions: Compared with TILA, SILA has the advantage of shorter hospital stay, and it can achieve comparable operative time, blood loss, postoperative recovery, postoperative pain and complications with TILA. The drawback is that SILA is associated with higher conversion rate, and perhaps higher surgical difficulty and hospitalization costs.

Methods: A review of literature was performed. N = 39 publications were reviewed. Results: For LILT and STEP, failure to achieve intestinal autonomy by conservative therapy represents the main indication, and end-stage liver disease the main contraindication. A sufficiently dilated intestinal segment is a common anatomical precondition for both procedures. STEP can be performed on shorter intestinal segments and on intricate segments such as the duodenum, which is technically not feasible for LILT. Both procedures have a similar extent of intestinal lengthening (approximately 70%) and result in improvement of enteral nutrition and reversal of complications of parenteral nutrition. STEP seems to have a lower mortality and overall progression to transplantation. Conclusions: STEP and LILT are both accepted procedures for non-transplant surgical management of SBS in children. The outcome after STEP seems to be more favourable, but larger series are needed to further assess accurate selection of eligible patients and to estimate effectiveness of procedures. A considerably higher number of cases for evaluation might be accomplished through the widespread use of a centralised registry.""

The estimated mortality is 2/100,000 population/year for children with SBS under 4 years [2] and 37.5% of neonates with SBS [3]. SBS in children occurs after congenital or acquired loss of part of the intestine [4], in most cases due to gastroschisis, necrotizing enterocolitis, mid-gut volvulus and intestinal atresia [5].""

- Quote: ""Abstract: Purpose: To compare LILT and STEP, the two principal procedures to lengthen the native bowel in children with a short bowel syndrome (SBS), by discussing the indications and presenting the outcome from published data. Methods: A review of literature was performed. N = 39 publications were reviewed. Results: For LILT and STEP, failure to achieve intestinal autonomy by conservative therapy represents the main indication, and end-stage liver disease the main contraindication. A sufficiently dilated intestinal segment is a common anatomical precondition for both procedures. STEP can be performed on shorter intestinal segments and on intricate segments such as the duodenum, which is technically not feasible for LILT. Both procedures have a similar extent of intestinal lengthening (approximately 70%) and result in improvement of enteral nutrition and reversal of complications of parenteral nutrition. STEP seems to have a lower mortality and overall progression to transplantation. Conclusions: STEP and LILT are both accepted procedures for non-transplant surgical management of SBS in children. The outcome after STEP seems to be more favourable, but larger series are needed to further assess accurate selection of eligible patients and to estimate effectiveness of procedures. A considerably higher number of cases for evaluation might be accomplished through the widespread use of a centralised registry.""

The estimated incidence in children is 24.5 per 100,000 live births with a higher incidence reported in preterm infants [2]. The estimated mortality is 2/100,000 population/year for children with SBS under 4 years [2] and 37.5% of neonates with SBS [3]. SBS in children occurs after congenital or acquired loss of part of the intestine [4], in most cases due to gastroschisis, necrotizing enterocolitis, mid-gut volvulus and intestinal atresia [5].""

- Quote: ""Abstract Background Laparoscopic orchidopexy (LO) has been widespread used in the management of non-palpable testis (NPT) in children. However, the real advantages of LO over traditional open orchidopexy (OO) still remain exclusive. Methods Published studies until August 31, 2010 were searched from Medline, Embase, Ovid, Web of Science, and Cochrane databases. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and observational clinical studies (OCSs) with a comparison of LO and OO were included for a systemic review and meta-analysis. Results Out of 226 studies, 2 RCTs and 5 OCSs were eligible for inclusion criteria, comprising 176 cases of LO and 263 cases of OO. The hospital stay of LO was significantly shorter than that of OO (WMD = -0.66; 95% confidence interval [CI] = -0.95 to -0.37; P \ 0.00001). However, no significant difference was observed between LO and OO in operative time (WMD = 4.02; 95% CI = -9.89 to 17.93; P = 0.57), time to resume feeding (WMD = -2.29; 95% CI = -6.78 to 2.20; P = 0.32) or full activity (WMD = -9.71; 95% CI = -27.84 to 8.42; P = 0.29), recurrence (OR = 0.60; 95% CI = 0.13 to 2.72; P = 0.51), viable testis rate (OR = 1.61; 95% CI = 0.30 to 8.52; P = 0.58), success rate (OR = 1.41; 95% CI = 0.44 to 4.46; P = 0.56), and testicular atrophy (OR = 1.70; 95% CI = 0.49 to 5.98; P = 0.40). Conclusion Although shorter hospital stay is noted in LO, it does not provide significant advantage over open surgery for treating NPT. However, due to the publishing bias, a series of RCTs are necessary to explore the efficiencies of LO in the management of NPT in children.""

P3. Introduction / Rationale: Describe the rationale for the review in the context of what is already known.
- Quote: ""The undescended testes (cryptorchidism) is one of the most common disorders of childhood, affecting 0.8–1.8% of infants at 1 year of age, 3% of full-term newborns, and 21% of premature babies [1, 2]. Approximate 20% of these cases represent non-palpable testes (NPT) that can be abdominal (normal or dysgenetic and high or low), intracanalicular, ectopic, or absent (true monorchia or vanishing testis) [1]. It has been established that abdominal testes may be associated with an increased risk of infertility and cancer [3, 4]. The incidence of carcinoma in situ is determined to be 1.7% among patients with undescended testes, especially among those 18–20 years of age [4]. Thus, early diagnosis and treatment of undescended testis are needed to preserve fertility and to prevent testicular malignancy.""

- Quote: ""Abstract Background Laparoscopic orchidopexy (LO) has been widespread used in the management of non-palpable testis (NPT) in children. However, the real advantages of LO over traditional open orchidopexy (OO) still remain exclusive. Methods Published studies until August 31, 2010 were searched from Medline, Embase, Ovid, Web of Science, and Cochrane databases. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and observational clinical studies (OCSs) with a comparison of LO and OO were included for a systemic review and meta-analysis. Results Out of 226 studies, 2 RCTs and 5 OCSs were eligible for inclusion criteria, comprising 176 cases of LO and 263 cases of OO. The hospital stay of LO was significantly shorter than that of OO (WMD = -0.66; 95% confidence interval [CI] = -0.95 to -0.37; P \ 0.00001). However, no significant difference was observed between LO and OO in operative time (WMD = 4.02; 95% CI = -9.89 to 17.93; P = 0.57), time to resume feeding (WMD = -2.29; 95% CI = -6.78 to 2.20; P = 0.32) or full activity (WMD = -9.71; 95% CI = -27.84 to 8.42; P = 0.29), recurrence (OR = 0.60; 95% CI = 0.13 to 2.72; P = 0.51), viable testis rate (OR = 1.61; 95% CI = 0.30 to 8.52; P = 0.58), success rate (OR = 1.41; 95% CI = 0.44 to 4.46; P = 0.56), and testicular atrophy (OR = 1.70; 95% CI = 0.49 to 5.98; P = 0.40). Conclusion Although shorter hospital stay is noted in LO, it does not provide significant advantage over open surgery for treating NPT. However, due to the publishing bias, a series of RCTs are necessary to explore the efficiencies of LO in the management of NPT in children.""

P3. Introduction / Rationale: Describe the rationale for the review in the context of what is already known.
- Quote: ""The undescended testes (cryptorchidism) is one of the most common disorders of childhood, affecting 0.8–1.8% of infants at 1 year of age, 3% of full-term newborns, and 21% of premature babies [1, 2]. Approximate 20% of these cases represent non-palpable testes (NPT) that can be abdominal (normal or dysgenetic and high or low), intracanalicular, ectopic, or absent (true monorchia or vanishing testis) [1]. It has been established that abdominal testes may be associated with an increased risk of infertility and cancer [3, 4]. The incidence of carcinoma in situ is determined to be 1.7% among patients with undescended testes, especially among those 18–20 years of age [4].

Abstract / Structured summary: Provide a structured summary including, as applicable: background; objectives; data sources; study eligibility criteria, participants, and interventions; study appraisal and synthesis methods; results; limitations; conclusions and implications of key findings; systematic review registration number.
- Quote: ""Background/purpose: Interval appendicectomy (IA) is commonly performed after successful nonoperative treatment of appendix mass (AM); although, this approach has recently been challenged. We systematically reviewed the pediatric literature with regard to the justification for this practice. Methods: Using a defined search strategy, studies were identified and data were extracted independently by 2 reviewers. Incidences of recurrent appendicitis, complications after IA, and carcinoid tumor were estimated accounting for interstudy heterogeneity. Cost and length of stay of IA were analyzed. Results: Three studies (127 cases) reporting routine nonsurgical treatment were identified; all were retrospective. There was marked interstudy heterogeneity and variable follow-up. After successful nonoperative treatment of AM, the risk of recurrent appendicitis is 20.5% (95% confidence interval [CI], 14.3%-28.4%). The incidence of complications after IA (23 studies, n = 1247) is 3.4% (95% CI, 2.2-5.1), and the incidence of carcinoid tumor found at IA (15 studies, n = 955) is 0.9% (95% CI, 0.5-1.8). No reports compared costs. Mean length of stay for IA was 3 days (range, 1-30 days).

- Quote: ""Background/purpose: Interval appendicectomy (IA) is commonly performed after successful nonoperative treatment of appendix mass (AM); although, this approach has recently been challenged. We systematically reviewed the pediatric literature with regard to the justification for this practice. Methods: Using a defined search strategy, studies were identified and data were extracted independently by 2 reviewers. Incidences of recurrent appendicitis, complications after IA, and carcinoid tumor were estimated accounting for interstudy heterogeneity. Cost and length of stay of IA were analyzed. Results: Three studies (127 cases) reporting routine nonsurgical treatment were identified; all were retrospective. There was marked interstudy heterogeneity and variable follow-up. After successful nonoperative treatment of AM, the risk of recurrent appendicitis is 20.5% (95% confidence interval [CI], 14.3%-28.4%). The incidence of complications after IA (23 studies, n = 1247) is 3.4% (95% CI, 2.2-5.1), and the incidence of carcinoid tumor found at IA (15 studies, n = 955) is 0.9% (95% CI, 0.5-1.8). No reports compared costs. Mean length of stay for IA was 3 days (range, 1-30 days). Conclusions: Prospective studies comparing routine IA with nonoperative treatment without IA in children are lacking. Available data suggest that 80% of children with AM may not need IA. A prospective study to evaluate the natural history of this condition compared with the morbidity and costs of IA is warranted.""
