Second, because of the wide variation of reported outcomes, no formal meta-analysis and calculation of summary statistics could be performed. Finally, our review only included articles published in English, which may have contributed to a selection bias by omitting relevant articles published in other languages.""
Limitations are discussed.

[Yes] ""Preputial reconstruction is an option particularly in patients with distal hypospadias without associated penile curvature. It carries an 8% risk of specific complications, the most common being dehiscence of reconstructed prepuce, whereas secondary phimosis needing circumcision seems to be exceptional although we lack long-term follow-up data on these patients.
