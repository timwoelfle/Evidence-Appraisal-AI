Eligibility criteria:

Quote: ""Participants were included who scored >2 on the General Health Questionnaire 12, a measure of psychological distress, or >7 on the anxiety and depression subscales of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, thus confirming they had low mood.""

The eligibility criteria are focused on including patients with confirmed low mood based on validated questionnaires. This is more selective than simply including all patients with MS who may present with low mood symptoms in usual care.

Score: [2] Rather explanatory

Recruitment:

Quote: ""Participants were recruited for a randomized trial of adjustment groups for people with multiple sclerosis and low mood between June 2008 and September 2009.""

No details are provided on how participants were recruited, but it seems they were specifically recruited for this trial rather than identified during routine clinic visits. Extra effort was likely made to identify and recruit eligible patients.

No quotes. The setting is not described.

Score: [NA]

Organisation:

Quote: ""The groups were delivered by two Band 5 assistant psychologists, who were supervised by a Band 8a clinical psychologist, experienced in working with people with multiple sclerosis.""

8. Primary outcome

Quote: ""Primary outcome—Recovery of facial function as rated on the House-Brackmann scale."" 

Quote: ""Test not routinely used in primary care and requires training. It is, however, an easy clinical test widely used in secondary care for grading recovery from facial nerve paralysis caused by damage to lower motor neurons.""

Quote: ""Central adjudication—Photographs taken of patients were assessed and graded independently by a panel of three experts (not general practitioners, who usually assess).""

The primary outcome measure is not routinely used in the usual care setting and requires specialist training and central adjudication. This reduces pragmatism.

1. Eligibility criteria

Quotes:
- ""Pregnant women were eligible if they were to undergo delivery by lower segment caesarean section through a transverse abdominal incision, irrespective of fever in labour, gestational age, or multiple pregnancies.""
- ""Women were not eligible if there was a clear indication for a particular surgical technique or material to be used that prevented any of the allocated interventions being used, if they had more than one previous caesarean section, or if they had already been recruited into the trial.""

Explanation: The eligibility criteria are quite broad, including women undergoing first or second caesarean section, irrespective of gestational age or presence of fever. The only exclusions are if there is a clear indication for a particular technique, more than one previous caesarean section, or previous recruitment into the trial. This suggests the trial intends to recruit a patient population similar to routine practice.

Score: [4] Rather pragmatic

2. Recruitment

Quotes: 
- ""Each participating site, advised by their research ethics committee, decided how to provide trial information to women and seek informed consent.""

Explanation: The paper does not provide much detail on the recruitment process. However, it seems that participants were recruited during their routine prenatal care, as the trial was discussed with eligible women and consent obtained. There is no mention of any special recruitment efforts. 

Score: [4] Rather pragmatic

3. Setting

Quotes:
- ""CORONIS was undertaken at 19 sites in Argentina, Chile, Ghana, India, Kenya, Pakistan, and Sudan.""

Explanation: The trial was conducted across multiple sites in 7 countries. The sites appear to be routine maternity care settings in these countries, rather than specialized trial or academic centers. This matches the real-world settings where caesarean sections are performed.

Score: [5] Very pragmatic

4. Organization

Quotes:
- ""Each regional coordinator (one per country, except India, which was split into two regions) started and documented a training programme that ensured that surgeons operating within the trial were familiar with the techniques being compared before participating.""

Explanation: The paper mentions that surgeons received training on the techniques being compared, but does not suggest any other changes to staffing, resources, or care delivery compared to routine practice. The caesarean sections seem to have been incorporated into standard care at the participating sites.

Score: [5] Very pragmatic 

5. Flexibility: Delivery

Quotes:
- ""All non-allocated surgical elements and all other aspects of the caesarean section procedure were undertaken at the discretion of the surgeon."" 
- ""In particular, there were no restrictions on the type of suture material that could be used, and standard measures to achieve haemostasis were employed regardless of the allocated intervention.""

Explanation: The surgeons had flexibility in how the allocated intervention was delivered along with all other aspects of care. No protocol was enforced aside from the allocated technique. This matches the flexibility found in routine practice.

Score: [5] Very pragmatic

6. Flexibility: Adherence

Quotes: None relevant

Explanation: The paper does not mention any strategies to enforce or monitor participant adherence. There is no discussion of withdrawal criteria or measures to improve adherence. 

Score: [5] Very pragmatic

7. Follow-up

Quotes:
- ""Data were collected at trial entry, immediately after surgery, at hospital discharge (including hospital transfer or death), and at about 6 weeks after delivery.""
- ""Women who did not return at 6 weeks were located and interviewed by telephone or during a home visit.""

Explanation: Follow-up consisted of data collection at standard time points through 6 weeks post-delivery. Women were contacted if they did not return for the 6 week follow-up. This does not seem substantially different from routine follow-up after delivery.

Score: [4] Rather pragmatic

8. Primary Outcome

Quotes: 
- ""The primary outcome was a composite of death, maternal infectious morbidity, further operative procedures, or blood transfusion of more than 1 unit of whole blood or packed cells up to the 6-week follow-up visit.""

Explanation: The primary outcome is a composite of major maternal complications that are clinically meaningful to patients. The components would be routinely assessed in practice.

Eligibility criteria 
Score: [4] Rather pragmatic

Relevant quotes: 
""Eighty people with Expanded Disability Status scores of 1 to 6.5 participated in this trial.""
""Inclusion criteria were as follows: (1) diagnosed with MS in accordance with the McDonald criteria; (2) registered at the MS outpatient clinic; (3) living in 1 of 6 selected municipalities; (4) aged 18 years or older; (5) capable of providing signed written informed consent; and (6) EDSS score between 1 and 6.5 (1 = minor disability, 6.5 = able to walk 20 m with or without a walking aid).""

The eligibility criteria are fairly broad, including adults with mild to moderate MS based on EDSS scores. The criteria seem to match reasonably well with patients who would receive this intervention in usual care. The inclusion of patients across a range of disability levels makes this domain rather pragmatic.

Recruitment
Score: [4] Rather pragmatic 

Relevant quotes:
""In August 2015, 1 of the MS nurses at the Department of Neurology, Nordland Hospital Trust in Bodø, Norway, sent out invitation letters with a consent form to 160 persons with MS who were registered at the MS outpatient clinic, had EDSS scores of 0 to 7, and lived in 1 of the 6 municipalities included in the study.""

Participants were recruited from an MS clinic registry, which seems reasonably similar to how patients would be engaged for this intervention in usual care. Sending invitation letters to participate is more effort than purely opportunistic recruitment during clinic visits, but is still a fairly pragmatic approach.

Setting
Score: [5] Very pragmatic

Relevant quotes: 
""The GroupCoreDIST intervention was conducted by 6 physical therapists in 6 municipalities in Norway.""

The intervention was delivered in multiple municipalities, suggesting a range of standard care settings where MS patients would receive physical therapy. This diversity of settings makes it very pragmatic.

Organization
Score: [4] Rather pragmatic

Relevant quote:  
""Six neurological physical therapists conducted the intervention after being trained in GroupCoreDIST for 5 days.""

Having specialized physical therapists conduct the intervention requires some additional training and expertise beyond usual care. However, the therapists already had background in neurological physical therapy, so the increment in expertise was modest. Overall, the organization seems reasonably similar to usual care.

Flexibility: delivery
Score: [4] Rather pragmatic

Relevant quotes:
""The physical therapists had varied experience (between 7–25 years) and certification (2 had both a master’s degree in neurological physical therapy and were clinical specialists in neurological physical therapy, 1 was a clinical specialist in neurological physical therapy, and 3 were generalists in physical therapy).""

""The physical therapists conducted an individual clinical examination of each participant. The examinations were followed by group sessions, in which the physical therapists chose from 33 exercises, all with 5 levels of difficulty to address each individual’s impairments underlying his or her balance disturbance."" 

The protocol allows flexibility in exercise selection and progression based on each patient's impairments and abilities. However, there is more structure and monitoring compared to complete flexibility as in usual care.

Flexibility: adherence
Score: [5] Very pragmatic

Relevant quote: 
""Participants in the intervention group were encouraged not to seek any physical therapy other than GroupCoreDIST during the 6 weeks of the intervention.""

No special measures were used to enforce or monitor adherence. Patients were free to participate and engage with the intervention as in usual care.

Follow-up
Score: [2] Rather explanatory

Relevant quotes:
""Assessments were undertaken at baseline and at weeks 7, 18, and 30.""

The intensive follow-up schedule with multiple post-intervention assessments is more frequent than would occur in usual care.

Primary outcome
Score: [4] Rather pragmatic

Relevant quotes: 
""Outcomes were measured with the Trunk Impairment Scale–Norwegian Version, Mini Balance Evaluation Systems Test, and Patient Global Impression of Change–Balance.""

The outcomes focus on balance and trunk control which are meaningful patient-centered measures. The scales used are clinically relevant but require some specialized testing beyond usual care.

Eligibility criteria 
Score: [4] Rather pragmatic

Relevant quotes: 
""Eighty people with Expanded Disability Status scores of 1 to 6.5 participated in this trial.""
""Inclusion criteria were as follows: (1) diagnosed with MS in accordance with the McDonald criteria; (2) registered at the MS outpatient clinic; (3) living in 1 of 6 selected municipalities; (4) aged 18 years or older; (5) capable of providing signed written informed consent; and (6) EDSS score between 1 and 6.5 (1 = minor disability, 6.5 = able to walk 20 m with or without a walking aid).""

The eligibility criteria are fairly broad, including adults with mild to moderate MS based on EDSS scores. The criteria seem to match reasonably well with patients who would receive this intervention in usual care. The inclusion of patients across a range of disability levels makes this domain rather pragmatic.

Recruitment
Score: [4] Rather pragmatic 

Relevant quotes:
""In August 2015, 1 of the MS nurses at the Department of Neurology, Nordland Hospital Trust in Bodø, Norway, sent out invitation letters with a consent form to 160 persons with MS who were registered at the MS outpatient clinic, had EDSS scores of 0 to 7, and lived in 1 of the 6 municipalities included in the study.""

Participants were recruited from an MS clinic registry, which seems reasonably similar to how patients would be engaged for this intervention in usual care. Sending invitation letters to participate is more effort than purely opportunistic recruitment during clinic visits, but is still a fairly pragmatic approach.

Setting
Score: [5] Very pragmatic

Relevant quotes: 
""The GroupCoreDIST intervention was conducted by 6 physical therapists in 6 municipalities in Norway.""

The intervention was delivered in multiple municipalities, suggesting a range of standard care settings where MS patients would receive physical therapy. This diversity of settings makes it very pragmatic.

Organization
Score: [4] Rather pragmatic

Relevant quote:  
""Six neurological physical therapists conducted the intervention after being trained in GroupCoreDIST for 5 days.""

Having specialized physical therapists conduct the intervention requires some additional training and expertise beyond usual care. However, the therapists already had background in neurological physical therapy, so the increment in expertise was modest. Overall, the organization seems reasonably similar to usual care.

Flexibility: delivery
Score: [4] Rather pragmatic

Relevant quotes:
""The physical therapists had varied experience (between 7–25 years) and certification (2 had both a master’s degree in neurological physical therapy and were clinical specialists in neurological physical therapy, 1 was a clinical specialist in neurological physical therapy, and 3 were generalists in physical therapy).""

""The physical therapists conducted an individual clinical examination of each participant. The examinations were followed by group sessions, in which the physical therapists chose from 33 exercises, all with 5 levels of difficulty to address each individual’s impairments underlying his or her balance disturbance."" 

The protocol allows flexibility in exercise selection and progression based on each patient's impairments and abilities. However, there is more structure and monitoring compared to complete flexibility as in usual care.

Flexibility: adherence
Score: [5] Very pragmatic

Relevant quote: 
""Participants in the intervention group were encouraged not to seek any physical therapy other than GroupCoreDIST during the 6 weeks of the intervention.""

No special measures were used to enforce or monitor adherence. Patients were free to participate and engage with the intervention as in usual care.

Follow-up
Score: [2] Rather explanatory

Relevant quotes:
""Assessments were undertaken at baseline and at weeks 7, 18, and 30.""

The intensive follow-up schedule with multiple post-intervention assessments is more frequent than would occur in usual care.

Primary outcome
Score: [4] Rather pragmatic

Relevant quotes: 
""Outcomes were measured with the Trunk Impairment Scale–Norwegian Version, Mini Balance Evaluation Systems Test, and Patient Global Impression of Change–Balance.""

The outcomes focus on balance and trunk control which are meaningful patient-centered measures. The scales used are clinically relevant but require some specialized testing beyond usual care.

Primary analysis
Score: [5] Very pragmatic

Eligibility criteria 
Score: [3]

Relevant quote: ""Inclusion criteria were diagnosis of PPMS or SPMS, Internet access and some level of distress determined by a score of 3 or greater on the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12).""

The eligibility criteria are a mix of pragmatic and explanatory. Including only patients with PPMS and SPMS matches the intended intervention population. Requiring internet access and a minimum distress score makes the sample less representative of the overall PPMS/SPMS population. Overall, the criteria are equally pragmatic and explanatory.

Recruitment
Score: [2] 

Relevant quote: ""We recruited potential participants through adverts on the MS Society website and from National Health Service (NHS) MS centres across the UK.""

Recruitment involved advertising online and at specialty clinics, which requires more effort than recruiting patients already seeking care. This explanatory approach likely results in a less representative sample.

Follow-up was done via postal questionnaires, which required more intensive effort than usual care. This makes follow-up more explanatory.

Score: [2]

8. Primary outcome  

Quote: ""Participants expressed concern about the face validity, for people with MS, of the questionnaires used for the measurement of self-reported depression, including the Beck Depression Inventory II.""

The primary outcome of depression symptoms on BDI-II is patient-important but may lack face validity for MS patients.

Score: [3] 

9. Primary analysis

Quote: ""Primary analysis was an Intention To Treat (ITT) analysis which analysed all 24 participants according to their randomised treatment assignment ignoring non compliance, protocol deviations and withdrawal.""

The primary analysis was full ITT, which is very pragmatic.

Relevant quotes:
""Key inclusion criteria were age older than 18 years, a diagnosis of progressive multiple sclerosis (primary or secondary) according to McDonald’s criteria,21 and a score of 6·5–8·0 on the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS).""

""Key exclusion criteria were being within 3 months of ceasing a multiple sclerosis disease modifying drug, receiving steroid treatment within the preceding month, or participating in another clinical trial.""

The eligibility criteria are moderately pragmatic. The inclusion of adults with primary or secondary progressive MS with EDSS scores of 6.5-8.0 captures a relevant patient population for the intervention. However, the exclusion of those who recently ceased disease modifying drugs or steroids makes it less pragmatic. Overall, it strikes a balance between being explanatory and pragmatic. Score: [3]

Recruitment
Relevant quotes: 
""Participants were recruited through eight health care organisations, including the UK National Health Service (NHS) Trusts, social enterprises, and third sector multiple sclerosis therapy centres, in two regions (Devon–Cornwall and East Anglia) of the UK.""

""Individuals were invited consecutively until the allocated number of standing frames (dependent on commissioning costs) at each health care organisation had been reached.""  

The recruitment is moderately pragmatic. Recruiting consecutive patients from NHS and therapy centers where they would receive usual care is pragmatic. However, limiting recruitment based on number of standing frames makes it less pragmatic. Score: [3]  

Setting
Relevant quotes:
""Participants were recruited through eight health care organisations, including the UK National Health Service (NHS) Trusts, social enterprises, and third sector multiple sclerosis therapy centres, in two regions (Devon–Cornwall and East Anglia) of the UK.""

The setting is very pragmatic. Conducting the trial in NHS trusts and therapy centers where patients receive usual care makes the setting very applicable to real-world conditions. Score: [5]

Organization 
Relevant quotes:
""The intervention consisted of two home-based physiotherapy sessions (60 min each) to set up the standing frame programme, supported by six follow-up telephone calls (15 min per call)."" 

""The use of standing frames is a recognised core skill for UK trained neurological physiotherapists. To standardise and optimise implementation of the intervention, we provided educational materials and assessed fidelity to them.""

The organization is moderately pragmatic. Delivering the intervention with NHS physiotherapists in patients' homes mimics real-world conditions. However, providing additional training materials is less pragmatic. Score: [3]

Flexibility: delivery
Relevant quotes: None relevant.

There is insufficient information to assess flexibility of delivery. Score: [NA] 

Flexibility: adherence
Relevant quotes:
""Participants were asked to stand in the frame for 30 min three times per week over 20 weeks, and to record the frequency and duration of each stand in a daily diary.""

The flexibility of adherence is moderately pragmatic. Asking participants to stand for a recommended duration mimics a real-world exercise prescription. Allowing self-recording of adherence is also pragmatic. Score: [3]

Follow-up
Relevant quotes:
""Outcome assessments with use of clinician-rated and patient-rated measures at baseline, 20 weeks, and 36 weeks.""

""All participants were asked to record new symptoms, falls, and medication changes in a daily preformatted diary."" 

The follow-up is moderately pragmatic. Having assessment timepoints at 20 and 36 weeks is more frequent than usual care but not excessive. Self-report diaries are pragmatic but add some extra patient burden. Score: [3]

Primary outcome
Relevant quotes:  
""The primary outcome was motor function as measured by the Amended Motor Club Assessment (AMCA) score at the primary endpoint of 36 weeks post randomisation.""

The primary outcome is very pragmatic. The AMCA score of motor function is highly relevant and meaningful to patients. Score: [5]

Primary analysis
Relevant quotes:
""The primary analysis of the primary outcome, AMCA score at 36 weeks, followed a modified intention to treat approach, regardless of compliance to the intervention, but did exclude patients who were deemed ineligible after randomisation, those who withdrew from the trial and were unwilling for their previously collected data to be used, or those who did not provide baseline and week 36 measurements (ie, there was no imputation of missing baseline or week 36 scores for the primary analysis), and used an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) approach.""

The primary analysis is very pragmatic. Using a modified intention-to-treat approach with no imputation of missing data is a very pragmatic analysis. Score: [5]

In summary, this trial generally has moderate to high pragmatism, with very pragmatic choices for setting, primary outcome, and analysis. The eligibility criteria, recruitment, organization, and follow-up represent a balance between explanatory and pragmatic elements.

""Key exclusion criteria were being within 3 months of ceasing a multiple sclerosis disease modifying drug, receiving steroid treatment within the preceding month, or participating in another clinical trial.""

The eligibility criteria are moderately pragmatic. The inclusion of adults with primary or secondary progressive MS with EDSS scores of 6.5-8.0 captures a relevant patient population for the intervention. However, the exclusion of those who recently ceased disease modifying drugs or steroids makes it less pragmatic. Overall, it strikes a balance between being explanatory and pragmatic. Score: [3]

Recruitment
Relevant quotes: 
""Participants were recruited through eight health care organisations, including the UK National Health Service (NHS) Trusts, social enterprises, and third sector multiple sclerosis therapy centres, in two regions (Devon–Cornwall and East Anglia) of the UK.""

""Individuals were invited consecutively until the allocated number of standing frames (dependent on commissioning costs) at each health care organisation had been reached.""  

The recruitment is moderately pragmatic. Recruiting consecutive patients from NHS and therapy centers where they would receive usual care is pragmatic. However, limiting recruitment based on number of standing frames makes it less pragmatic. Score: [3]  

Setting
Relevant quotes:
""Participants were recruited through eight health care organisations, including the UK National Health Service (NHS) Trusts, social enterprises, and third sector multiple sclerosis therapy centres, in two regions (Devon–Cornwall and East Anglia) of the UK.""

The setting is very pragmatic. Conducting the trial in NHS trusts and therapy centers where patients receive usual care makes the setting very applicable to real-world conditions. Score: [5]

Organization 
Relevant quotes:
""The intervention consisted of two home-based physiotherapy sessions (60 min each) to set up the standing frame programme, supported by six follow-up telephone calls (15 min per call)."" 

""The use of standing frames is a recognised core skill for UK trained neurological physiotherapists. To standardise and optimise implementation of the intervention, we provided educational materials and assessed fidelity to them.""

The organization is moderately pragmatic. Delivering the intervention with NHS physiotherapists in patients' homes mimics real-world conditions. However, providing additional training materials is less pragmatic. Score: [3]

Flexibility: delivery
Relevant quotes: None relevant.

There is insufficient information to assess flexibility of delivery. Score: [NA] 

Flexibility: adherence
Relevant quotes:
""Participants were asked to stand in the frame for 30 min three times per week over 20 weeks, and to record the frequency and duration of each stand in a daily diary.""

The flexibility of adherence is moderately pragmatic. Asking participants to stand for a recommended duration mimics a real-world exercise prescription. Allowing self-recording of adherence is also pragmatic. Score: [3]

Follow-up
Relevant quotes:
""Outcome assessments with use of clinician-rated and patient-rated measures at baseline, 20 weeks, and 36 weeks.""

""All participants were asked to record new symptoms, falls, and medication changes in a daily preformatted diary."" 

The follow-up is moderately pragmatic. Having assessment timepoints at 20 and 36 weeks is more frequent than usual care but not excessive. Self-report diaries are pragmatic but add some extra patient burden. Score: [3]

Primary outcome
Relevant quotes:  
""The primary outcome was motor function as measured by the Amended Motor Club Assessment (AMCA) score at the primary endpoint of 36 weeks post randomisation.""

The primary outcome is very pragmatic. The AMCA score of motor function is highly relevant and meaningful to patients. Score: [5]

Primary analysis
Relevant quotes:
""The primary analysis of the primary outcome, AMCA score at 36 weeks, followed a modified intention to treat approach, regardless of compliance to the intervention, but did exclude patients who were deemed ineligible after randomisation, those who withdrew from the trial and were unwilling for their previously collected data to be used, or those who did not provide baseline and week 36 measurements (ie, there was no imputation of missing baseline or week 36 scores for the primary analysis), and used an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) approach.""

The primary analysis is very pragmatic. Using a modified intention-to-treat approach with no imputation of missing data is a very pragmatic analysis. Score: [5]

In summary, this trial generally has moderate to high pragmatism, with very pragmatic choices for setting, primary outcome, and analysis. The eligibility criteria, recruitment, organization, and follow-up represent a balance between explanatory and pragmatic elements. This aligns with the authors' aim to conduct a pragmatic trial evaluating the effectiveness of a standing frame program under real-world conditions."

The eligibility criteria are fairly broad, including adults over 18 with a diagnosis of MS confirmed by a physician. This is similar to criteria that would be used in usual practice. Some exclusions are made for safety reasons like recent relapse or pregnancy. Overall, the criteria seem intended to include typical MS patients who would receive this intervention in routine care.

2. Recruitment

Quote: ""Participants were referred to the project by themselves, their care-giver, MSI, chartered physiotherapists, neurologists, general practitioners or clinical nurse specialists."" 

Score: [4] Rather pragmatic

Participants were recruited through usual healthcare providers and self-referral, not through extensive advertising or incentives. This matches typical recruitment in routine practice.

3. Setting

Quote: ""All interventions took place in groups of eight, for an hour per week, for 10 weeks. They were delivered in community centres such as local gyms, hotels and health centres.""

Score: [5] Very pragmatic 

The interventions took place in community settings like gyms and health centers, which matches the typical real-world environment where MS patients would receive these interventions as part of routine care.

4. Organization

678,31099,1419,[],9,,"['2', '3', '4', '4', '4', '5', '2', '2', '5']"," Here are the PRECIS-2 domain scores and explanations for the trial:

1. Eligibility criteria 

Score: [2] Rather explanatory

Relevant quotes:
""Inclusion criteria were patients in South East London who were severely affected by MS and deemed (by clinicians) to have one or more of unresolved symptoms, psychosocial concerns, end-of-life issues, progressive illness, or complex needs (i.e., palliative care needs).""

""Exclusion criteria included if the referring staff or the screening deemed patients had very urgent needs or were deteriorating rapidly when immediate referral to the service was offered.""

The eligibility criteria are rather explanatory because patients were selected based on having palliative care needs as deemed by clinicians, indicating some subjectivity. Patients with very urgent needs were excluded, further limiting the participants to a narrower population. The criteria do not appear to match usual care eligibility.

2. Recruitment

Score: [3] Equally pragmatic and explanatory 

Relevant quotes: 
""Educational seminars informed local health and social care professionals about the PCT.""

""Reasons for drop out, no interview, and refusal were recorded whenever possible.""

The recruitment methods are not described in detail, but educational seminars were used to inform professionals who could refer patients, indicating some extra effort beyond usual care referrals. However, reasons for dropout were recorded, suggesting an intention to recruit typical patients. Overall the recruitment seems balanced between pragmatic and explanatory.

3. Setting

Score: [4] Rather pragmatic

Relevant quote:
""Patients in South East London, living with MS and deemed (by clinicians) to have one or more of unresolved symptoms, psychosocial concerns, end-of-life issues, progressive illness, or complex needs (i.e., palliative care needs).""

The setting of South East London and recruitment from the existing population of MS patients makes the setting rather pragmatic. It matches the intended real-world setting.

4. Organization

Score: [4] Rather pragmatic  

Relevant quotes:
""In addition to continuing to receive usual services (see below), patients in the fast-track group received care from a PCT. This comprised one part-time consultant in palliative medicine, one part-time clinical nurse specialist, one administrator, and one psychosocial worker, and was based in a large teaching hospital.""

""If patients were randomized to the fast track, their information was passed to the PCT, which contacted them within 48 hours. If patients were in the control arm, the researcher held their data until after the third research interview at 12 weeks.""


The palliative care team delivers the intervention using existing staffing and resources. Patients continue to receive usual care services alongside the PCT. This makes the organization rather pragmatic as it does not differ much from usual care.

5. Flexibility: delivery

Score: [4] Rather pragmatic

Relevant quote: 
""Patients had one to three contacts (visits and/or phone calls) from the PCT, although a small number (around 12%) were referred for longer-term ‘‘community’’ palliative care.""

The palliative care intervention is delivered with flexibility, with patients receiving 1-3 contacts on average. There is no strict protocol described. This flexibility matches usual care.

6. Flexibility: adherence

Score: [5] Very pragmatic

No relevant quotes.

The text does not mention any measures to enforce or monitor adherence. As a palliative care intervention, adherence measures are likely minimal as in usual care.

7. Follow-up

Score: [2] Rather explanatory

Relevant quotes:
""We conducted face-to-face interviews with patients and gave self-complete questionnaires to caregivers. At baseline, we collected demographic and clinical data, and the patient’s functional status (both self-report, using the United Kingdom Neurological Disability Scale [UNDS] and interviewer-assessed using the Expanded Disability Status Scale [EDSS], administered by a consultant neurologist [E. S.]). We collected outcome and cost data at baseline (before randomization) and at 6, 12, 18 (only control groupdafter they received PCT), and 24 weeks.""

""Our standardized questionnaires included the Palliative Care Outcome Scale (POS-8), comprising eight questions on anxiety, patient and carer concerns, and practical needs, each rated 0e4; a single-item POS pain score (rated 0 [best] to 4 [worst]); and caregivers’ burden (using the 12-item version of the Zarit Carer Burden Inventory [ZBI]).""

The follow-up is rather explanatory, with multiple detailed assessments at baseline and multiple time points using questionnaires and scales not typically used in usual care.

8. Primary outcome

Score: [2] Rather explanatory

Relevant quotes:
""At 12 weeks, caregiver burden was 4.47 points lower (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.05e7.89) in the fast track compared to the control group."" 

""There was a trend toward a reduction in pain in the fast-track group and an increase in the control group (with an effect size of 0.6 and a total sample size required to detect this is 56).""

The primary outcomes of caregiver burden (ZBI scale) and pain (POS scale) are measured with research scales not used in usual care. The time point of 12 weeks is also earlier than typical.

9. Primary analysis

Score: [5] Very pragmatic

Relevant quote:
""We planned an intention-to-treat analysis, irrespective of whether patients were assessed as having palliative care needs or the nature of contact with the PCT.""

The intention-to-treat analysis is very pragmatic, including all randomized patients regardless of adherence."," Here are the PRECIS-2 domain scores and explanations for the trial:

1. Eligibility criteria 

Score: [2] Rather explanatory

Relevant quotes:
""Inclusion criteria were patients in South East London who were severely affected by MS and deemed (by clinicians) to have one or more of unresolved symptoms, psychosocial concerns, end-of-life issues, progressive illness, or complex needs (i.e., palliative care needs).""

""Exclusion criteria included if the referring staff or the screening deemed patients had very urgent needs or were deteriorating rapidly when immediate referral to the service was offered.""

The eligibility criteria are rather explanatory because patients were selected based on having palliative care needs as deemed by clinicians, indicating some subjectivity. Patients with very urgent needs were excluded, further limiting the participants to a narrower population. The criteria do not appear to match usual care eligibility.

2. Recruitment

Score: [3] Equally pragmatic and explanatory 

Relevant quotes: 
""Educational seminars informed local health and social care professionals about the PCT.""

""Reasons for drop out, no interview, and refusal were recorded whenever possible.""

The recruitment methods are not described in detail, but educational seminars were used to inform professionals who could refer patients, indicating some extra effort beyond usual care referrals. However, reasons for dropout were recorded, suggesting an intention to recruit typical patients. Overall the recruitment seems balanced between pragmatic and explanatory.

3. Setting

Score: [4] Rather pragmatic

Relevant quote:
""Patients in South East London, living with MS and deemed (by clinicians) to have one or more of unresolved symptoms, psychosocial concerns, end-of-life issues, progressive illness, or complex needs (i.e., palliative care needs).""

The setting of South East London and recruitment from the existing population of MS patients makes the setting rather pragmatic. It matches the intended real-world setting.

4. Organization

Score: [4] Rather pragmatic  

Relevant quotes:
""In addition to continuing to receive usual services (see below), patients in the fast-track group received care from a PCT. This comprised one part-time consultant in palliative medicine, one part-time clinical nurse specialist, one administrator, and one psychosocial worker, and was based in a large teaching hospital.""

""If patients were randomized to the fast track, their information was passed to the PCT, which contacted them within 48 hours. If patients were in the control arm, the researcher held their data until after the third research interview at 12 weeks.""


The palliative care team delivers the intervention using existing staffing and resources. Patients continue to receive usual care services alongside the PCT. This makes the organization rather pragmatic as it does not differ much from usual care.

5. Flexibility: delivery

Score: [4] Rather pragmatic

Relevant quote: 
""Patients had one to three contacts (visits and/or phone calls) from the PCT, although a small number (around 12%) were referred for longer-term ‘‘community’’ palliative care.""

The palliative care intervention is delivered with flexibility, with patients receiving 1-3 contacts on average. There is no strict protocol described. This flexibility matches usual care.

6. Flexibility: adherence

Score: [5] Very pragmatic

No relevant quotes.

The text does not mention any measures to enforce or monitor adherence. As a palliative care intervention, adherence measures are likely minimal as in usual care.

7. Follow-up

Follow-up:
Quotes:
""Other measures of physical function were also included as were measures of fatigue and health-related quality of life.""

Explanation: Follow-up is moderately pragmatic. Participants completed outcome assessments at baseline, 3, 6, and 12 months. The outcomes assessed are clinically meaningful. Frequency of follow-up is greater than usual care but likely needed to capture study outcomes.

Score: [3]

Primary outcome:
Quotes:
""Primary outcome was peak oxygen consumption (VO2peak) at 12 months""

Explanation: The primary outcome is moderately pragmatic. VO2peak is a clinically meaningful measure of exercise capacity. However, it requires exercise testing equipment not routinely used in usual care.

Eligibility criteria:
Quotes:
""Ambulatory and sedentary.""
""Inclusion criteria were (1) ambulatory (can walk 100 m, be capable of walking 100 metres without a walking aid corresponding to a classification of ≤5.5 on the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS), even if they do use an aid for daily activities; and (2) self-reported to be sedentary or irregularly active at time of study entry (i.e. do not exercise 30 minutes or more twice per week of moderate to vigorous activity).""  
""Excluded were people who were (1) unable to speak and read English or French; (2) unable to respond to simple questions on orientation and memory; (3) have an additional illness that restricts their function; and/or (4) experienced a relapse during the past 30 days as this may affect physical activity/exercise participation.""

Explanation: The eligibility criteria are moderately pragmatic as they aim to include ambulatory and sedentary patients typical of those who would receive exercise interventions in usual care. However, they exclude those with cognitive impairments, additional illnesses, and recent relapses which reduces pragmatism. Overall, a moderately pragmatic approach.

Score: [3]

Recruitment:
Quotes:  
""People were recruited from four multiple sclerosis clinics in three Canadian cities and from posting on media sites.""
""Those contacting the research team directly were assessed for eligibility over the phone and sent information on the study electronically. For those eligible, a visit was scheduled to explain study procedures, obtain consent, and carry out the assessment.""

Explanation: Recruitment is moderately pragmatic - participants were identified from MS clinics, which is similar to usual care. However, additional recruitment through media and online posting makes it more explanatory. Overall, a mix of clinic recruitment and more intensive methods.

Score: [3] 

Setting:
Quotes:
""Ambulatory and sedentary.""
""People were recruited from four multiple sclerosis clinics in three Canadian cities and from posting on media sites.""

Explanation: The setting is multiple sclerosis clinics, which matches the usual care setting where exercise interventions would normally be delivered. Recruiting from multiple clinics enhances pragmatism.

Score: [4]

Organization:
Quotes:
""Participants in both groups received two private training sessions with the physical therapist or exercise therapist.""

Explanation: Organization is moderately pragmatic. Participants received an initial training session to learn the exercises, similar to what would occur in usual care. No mention of requiring extra staffing or resources. However, the training sessions were provided by study staff, rather than usual care providers. Overall, generally matches usual care.

Score: [3]

Flexibility (delivery):
Quotes: 
""MSTEP©, a personally adapted exercise regimen including a variety of exercises targeting endurance, muscular, and core strength, balance, flexibility, muscular power, and speed of movement.""
""The goal of the MSTEP© programme is to promote regular bouts of activity most days per week, encouraging a balance between rest and activity, and taking into consideration the physical and emotional status and capacity of the person.""

Eligibility criteria:

Relevant quotes:

""Subjects had a definite diagnosis of primary or secondary progressive MS, and an EDSS of between 6.5 (constant bilateral assistance required to walk about 20 metres without resting) to 8 (essentially restricted to bed or chair or perambulated in wheelchair, but may be out of bed much of the day, retains many self-care functions and generally has effective use of arms).""

""People with MS who were medically stable were selected where cognitive function was adequate, as assessed by a Mini Mental State Examination score of 23 or over and had at least three identifiable physiotherapy goals were included."" 

""Potential subjects were excluded if they had rapidly progressing disease, were already involved in a physiotherapy programme, had additional neurological conditions or other medical conditions which would preclude them taking part in the study.""

Reasoning: The eligibility criteria are quite restrictive, excluding those with additional conditions, already receiving physiotherapy, rapidly progressing disease, and poor cognition. The EDSS range is narrow. This suggests the trial is aiming for a specific MS population rather than being highly inclusive as in usual care.

Score: [2]

Recruitment:

Relevant quote: 

""People moderately to severely affected by MS were recruited from the MS Service, NHS Ayrshire and Arran.""

Reasoning: Participants were recruited from a single MS service rather than multiple settings like primary care where MS patients might first present. This suggests more effort than usual care to identify and recruit participants. 

Score: [2] 

Setting:

Relevant quote:

""Subjects assigned to Group 1 received physiotherapy, twice weekly for eight weeks, by an experienced domiciliary physiotherapist within their home.""

Reasoning: The intervention was delivered in the patients' own homes. This matches the usual care setting where moderately to severely disabled MS patients would receive physiotherapy.

1. Eligibility criteria

Quote: ""To be eligible, all patients screened for study participation had to be affected by clinically definite multiple sclerosis and live in the Rome service area.""

Score: [2] Rather explanatory

This study had strict inclusion criteria requiring patients to have clinically definite MS based on specific diagnostic criteria. The patients also had to live in a certain geographic area. This limits the trial to a narrower population than would be seen in usual care.

2. Recruitment

Quote: ""Patients were recruited from the multiple sclerosis centre of the neurological department of La Sapienza University, or from other institutional centres for multiple sclerosis in Rome."" 

Score: [2] Rather explanatory  

Patients were recruited from specialty MS centers rather than from the settings where they would normally receive care. This makes the recruitment more explanatory.

3. Setting

Quote: ""The study was conducted in Rome and was approved by the ethics committee of La Sapienza University.""

Score: [2] Rather explanatory

The study was conducted at a single university site. This specialized setting is more explanatory compared to the varied settings where patients would receive usual care.

4. Organization

Quote: ""Based on individual needs, patients randomised to home based care were followed through home visits and telephone follow up. A dedicated phone number was available five days a week from 9 am to 5 pm, where an operator addressed questions or concerns from patients and caregivers and contacted the different specialists according to the specific requirement.""

Score: [4] Rather pragmatic

The home-based intervention used existing healthcare staff and resources that would be available in the community. This matches usual care reasonably closely.

5. Flexibility: delivery

Quote: ""The home based care multidisciplinary team included two neurologists, a urologist, a rehabilitation physician, a psychologist, a physical therapist, a nurse, a social worker, and a coordinator. These were provided with cell phones and could easily be reached for advice (telephone intervention) or direct face to face intervention when required.""

Score: [3] Equally pragmatic and explanatory 

The home-based care allowed for some flexibility in delivery while also having a dedicated team to provide specialized care. This balances pragmatic and explanatory elements.

6. Flexibility: adherence

Score: [NA] 

No relevant quotes found. The paper does not mention any strategies to enforce or monitor adherence.

7. Follow-up

Quote: ""At the end of a one year follow up period, all patients underwent the same comprehensive interview as at baseline.""

Score: [3] Equally pragmatic and explanatory

Patients were followed for 1 year, which is longer than usual care. However, the intensity and frequency of measurement does not seem much different from usual care.

8. Primary outcome  

Quote: ""Functional outcomes were calculated as the mean change of scores from baseline to the final follow up at 12 months.""

Score: [4] Rather pragmatic

9. Primary analysis

Quote: ""For each scale of the SF-36 and separately for the case and control group, we adopted a regression model in which score changes at the end of the follow up period were adjusted for the baseline values.""

Score: [5] Very pragmatic

The analysis seems to use all available data without exclusions. This is a very pragmatic, intention-to-treat approach."," Here are the PRECIS-2 domain scores and explanations for the given paper:

1. Eligibility criteria

Quote: ""To be eligible, all patients screened for study participation had to be affected by clinically definite multiple sclerosis and live in the Rome service area.""

Score: [2] Rather explanatory

This study had strict inclusion criteria requiring patients to have clinically definite MS based on specific diagnostic criteria. The patients also had to live in a certain geographic area. This limits the trial to a narrower population than would be seen in usual care.

2. Recruitment

Quote: ""Patients were recruited from the multiple sclerosis centre of the neurological department of La Sapienza University, or from other institutional centres for multiple sclerosis in Rome."" 

Score: [2] Rather explanatory  

Patients were recruited from specialty MS centers rather than from the settings where they would normally receive care. This makes the recruitment more explanatory.

3. Setting

Quote: ""The study was conducted in Rome and was approved by the ethics committee of La Sapienza University.""

Score: [2] Rather explanatory

The study was conducted at a single university site. This specialized setting is more explanatory compared to the varied settings where patients would receive usual care.

4. Organization

Quote: ""Based on individual needs, patients randomised to home based care were followed through home visits and telephone follow up. A dedicated phone number was available five days a week from 9 am to 5 pm, where an operator addressed questions or concerns from patients and caregivers and contacted the different specialists according to the specific requirement.""

Score: [4] Rather pragmatic

The home-based intervention used existing healthcare staff and resources that would be available in the community. This matches usual care reasonably closely.

5. Flexibility: delivery

Quote: ""The home based care multidisciplinary team included two neurologists, a urologist, a rehabilitation physician, a psychologist, a physical therapist, a nurse, a social worker, and a coordinator. These were provided with cell phones and could easily be reached for advice (telephone intervention) or direct face to face intervention when required.""

Score: [3] Equally pragmatic and explanatory 

The home-based care allowed for some flexibility in delivery while also having a dedicated team to provide specialized care. This balances pragmatic and explanatory elements.

6. Flexibility: adherence

Score: [NA] 

No relevant quotes found. The paper does not mention any strategies to enforce or monitor adherence.

7. Follow-up

Quote: ""At the end of a one year follow up period, all patients underwent the same comprehensive interview as at baseline.""

Score: [3] Equally pragmatic and explanatory

Patients were followed for 1 year, which is longer than usual care. However, the intensity and frequency of measurement does not seem much different from usual care.

8. Primary outcome  

Quote: ""Functional outcomes were calculated as the mean change of scores from baseline to the final follow up at 12 months.""

Score: [4] Rather pragmatic

The primary outcome of change in functional scores is clinically meaningful for patients.

9. Primary analysis

Quote: ""For each scale of the SF-36 and separately for the case and control group, we adopted a regression model in which score changes at the end of the follow up period were adjusted for the baseline values.""

Participants randomized to ‘usual care’ continued with separate medications and doses as prescribed by their doctor.""  

Score: [4] Participants were randomized after being recruited, implying they were already receiving care. No special efforts beyond usual care are mentioned. Overall recruitment seems mostly pragmatic.

3. Setting

Quote: ""We conducted a randomized, open-label trial involving 623 participants from Australian general practices.""

Score: [4] Conducted in general practices where patients would normally receive care. Multi-center increases applicability. Overall a pragmatic setting.

4. Organization

Quote: ""All participants were treated by their regular doctor following randomization.""

Score: [5] No changes were made to expertise or resources beyond usual care. Very pragmatic organization.

5. Flexibility: Delivery

Quote: ""Those allocated to the polypill-based strategy were prescribed one of the polypill versions at the discretion of their doctor.""

Score: [4] The polypill was prescribed but doctors could modify as needed, similar to usual care. Mostly pragmatic flexibility.

6. Flexibility: Adherence 

No relevant quotes.

Score: [NA] Adherence of participants is not discussed.

7. Follow-up

Quote: ""Participants attended the primary healthcare centres for trial assessments at randomization and 12 month intervals thereafter.""

Score: [3] Follow-up visits occurred but were not excessive. Frequency seems intermediate between pragmatic and explanatory. 

8. Primary outcome

Quote: ""Primary outcomes were self-reported use of indicated combination treatment...at study end; and changes in systolic BP and total cholesterol from baseline to study end.""

Score: [4] Outcomes of medication adherence, blood pressure and cholesterol are clinically meaningful. Mostly pragmatic choice of outcomes.

9. Primary analysis

No analysis details provided.

Score: [NA] The analysis approach is not described."

1. Eligibility criteria 
Score: [3]

Relevant quotes:
""Patients were eligible for inclusion if they were aged 16 years or older and presented within 3 weeks after sustaining a displaced fracture of the proximal humerus that involved the surgical neck.""
""Excluded patients had associated dislocation of the injured shoulder joint, open fracture, insufficient mental capacity to understand the trial or instructions for rehabilitation, comorbidities precluding surgery or anesthesia, clear indication for surgery such as severe soft-tissue compromise, multiple injuries (upper limb fractures), pathological fracture (other than osteoporotic), terminal illness, or were not a resident in the hospital catchment area.""

The eligibility criteria are moderately pragmatic. Patients of all adult ages are included, which is pragmatic. However, patients with comorbidities precluding surgery are excluded, as well as those with clear indications for surgery, which makes it more explanatory. Overall, I think it balances out to be equally pragmatic and explanatory.

2. Recruitment
Score: [4] 
Relevant quotes: 
""Patients received their allocated treatment from the recruiting hospital.""

The patients seem to be recruited during routine care at the participating hospitals. There is no mention of any special recruitment efforts like media campaigns or incentives. This makes recruitment rather pragmatic.

3. Setting
Score: [4]

Relevant quotes:  
""The PROFHER collaborators recruited patients for this pragmatic, open, multicenter, parallel-group, superiority, randomized clinical trial between September 2008 and April 2011 from orthopedic departments (fracture clinics or wards) at 32 acute UK National Health Service hospitals.""

The trial is conducted at 32 acute NHS hospitals across the UK that routinely provide standard surgical and nonsurgical fracture treatment. This multicenter design across routine care settings is a rather pragmatic choice.

4. Organization
Score: [4]

Relevant quotes:
""Care pathways for all patients included outpatient- and community-based rehabilitation, which primarily comprised 1 or more 1-on-1 sessions with a physiotherapist that focused on restoring function.""
""To avoid learning curve problems, surgeons and physiotherapists used surgical interventions and procedures with which they were familiar."" 

The trial appears to utilize the existing standard of care in terms of staff expertise, resources, and organization. Surgeons performed procedures they were familiar with. This approach is rather pragmatic.

5. Flexibility: Delivery
Score: [4]

Relevant quotes: 
""It was emphasized that good standards of care, both surgical and nonsurgical, should be provided throughout the treatment pathway for the injury, including surgical care or management of the sling, postoperative care, and rehabilitation in both groups.""

The delivery of the interventions seems flexible and according to usual care standards, which is a rather pragmatic choice. No strict protocol is mentioned.

6. Flexibility: Adherence
Score: [5]

Relevant quotes:
No relevant quotes found.

There is no mention of any measures to enforce or monitor adherence. This suggests a very pragmatic approach.

7. Follow-up
Score: [3]

Relevant quotes:
""Follow-up was up to 2 years (until April 2013) for all patients."" 
""The OSS was collected by postal questionnaires at 6, 12, and 24 months.""

A 2-year follow-up via mailed questionnaires is moderately pragmatic. It is longer than usual care but done remotely without extensive in-person data collection.

8. Primary outcome
Score: [5] 

Relevant quotes:  
""The primary outcome was the Oxford Shoulder Score (OSS), which is a shoulder-specific outcome measure validated in a UK population.""

The OSS is a patient-reported outcome directly relevant to participants. This is a very pragmatic choice of primary outcome.

9. Primary analysis
Score: [5]

Relevant quotes:
""Analyses followed a prespecified analysis plan, endorsed by the data monitoring and ethics committee, and were performed using Stata version 12 (StataCorp). All analyses were on an intention-to-treat basis and included all randomized patients in the groups to which they were randomized.""

Eligibility criteria 
Quote: ""Patients were eligible to participate if they were: community dwelling aged ≥65 years; independently mobile (with or without a walking aid); and physically able to take part in group exercise. Patients were excluded if they: had experienced ≥3 falls in the previous year; had unstable clinical conditions; would be unable to follow instructions about exercise safely; or were receiving palliative care.""

Score: [3] The eligibility criteria are moderately pragmatic. The trial is limited to community-dwelling older adults who are mobile and able to participate in group exercise. However, they exclude some patients who may benefit from the intervention in usual care, such as those with a history of falls or unstable conditions. Overall, the criteria strike a balance between being pragmatic and ensuring patient safety.

Recruitment
Quote: ""Practices were recruited with assistance from Primary Care Research Networks for London, Derby, and Nottingham. Patients aged ≥65 years were identified by searches of computerised medical records and invited to participate by letter from their GP."" 

Score: [4] Recruitment is done through primary care practices, which is moderately pragmatic as this is where most older patients receive care. Patients are identified from medical records and invited by letter, which requires some additional effort beyond usual care. Overall, recruitment methods are more pragmatic than explanatory.

Setting
Quote: ""A three-arm, parallel-design cluster controlled trial was used, with allocation at the level of general practice in two centres (London and Nottingham/Derby).""

Score: [4] The trial is conducted in a primary care setting, which matches usual care. Using multiple centers increases generalizability. Overall, the setting is pragmatic.

Organisation
Quote: ""The FaME intervention took place in a group once a week and included exercises to be carried out at home, unsupervised, twice weekly. The OEP was undertaken at home, unsupervised, and comprised exercises to be done three times per week.""

Score: [4] The interventions utilize existing primary care staff and resources. Some training is provided, but not substantially beyond usual care. The organization is moderately pragmatic.

Flexibility: delivery
Quote: ""Volunteer peer mentors supported participants in the OEP arm, and weekly FaME classes were run in local venues by postural stability instructors trained to work with older people.""

Score: [3] There is some flexibility in delivery of the home OEP program but the FaME class intervention is more standardized. Overall, flexibility in delivery is moderately pragmatic.

Flexibility: adherence 
Quote: No relevant quotes.
