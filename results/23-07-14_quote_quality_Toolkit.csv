1528,Primary outcome,The aim of the present study was to determine the cost effectiveness of the intervention.,The aim of the present study was to determine the cost effectiveness of the intervention.,"A high proportion of those with multiple sclerosis have emotional problems and these adversely affect their quality of life.1,2 Psychological interventions have been shown to reduce depression and anxiety in people with multiple sclerosis.3,4 These interventions may be delivered in groups or individually. One potential advantage of group interventions, as compared with individual therapy, is that they may be more cost effective. Yet previous evaluations of the cost-effectiveness of similar treatments for elderly people with depression have indicated that while the treatments are effective they are also associated with an increased cost.5 However, the cost effectiveness of psychological treatments for people with multiple sclerosis has not been examined. In a recent trial of a psychological adjustment group for people with multiple sclerosis and low mood,3 results indicated that intervention improved mood and reduced the impact of multiple sclerosis in everyday life. These encouraging results suggested that the intervention should be provided as part of routine clinical practice. The aim of the present study was to determine the cost effectiveness of the intervention.",100.0

Baseline costs were examined for differences between groups, but were not used to adjust the results. A cost-effectiveness analysis was performed comparing the adjustment group with the usual care control group. Effectiveness was initially defined as the change in EQ-5D scores and a cost-effectiveness analysis was performed using this outcome measure. In addition, reductions in the BDI-II score from baseline to follow-up were analysed as an alternative measure of the cost effectiveness. The ICER, i.e. the difference in average costs divided by the difference in average effects between groups, was also calculated. In order to capture the uncertainty around the estimates, 1000 non-parametric bootstrap replications were generated from the sets of multiply imputed data, and mean cost and effect were plotted in a cost-effectiveness plane. As there are no published data on the threshold willingness to pay value for additional effectiveness associated with the group programme described, the probability that the programme will be considered cost effective was calculated for a range of threshold values and presented in a cost-effectiveness acceptability curve.",100.0

To further explore the impact of the intervention on the subgroup of patients showing signs of cognitive impairment, Z-scores were computed for each individual cognitive test and for cognitive domains (e.g. the composite processing speed Z-score includes the Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT) and the 3-second version of the Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test (PASAT)) as previously described.24 All longitudinal data for the total group and the cognitively impaired subgroup were analyzed using an intention-to-treat linear mixed effects model with time and group as the factors of interest.

Likelihood-ratio tests were used to test for equal/unequal standard deviations and correlations in the two groups for each outcome.

A previous randomised trial has shown that this intervention was cost-effective for patients with diabetes with minor to moderate depression: 9 months after receiving the intervention, depressive symptoms were significantly lower, there was a positive effect on patients’ quality of life, and patients experienced less anxiety, possessed more self-efficacy skills, demonstrated better glycaemic control and showed more participation in comparison to control patients.17–19 There was an implementation momentum. The health insurer promised to pay the costs for the extra care, and the care group gave a commitment to take care of training facilities and integration of SMS parameters into Electronic Medical Records. Some adjustments to the nurse-led intervention were crucial. Where the original intervention had been delivered at patients’ homes by specifically trained nurses from the research team who selected eligible patients by means of an elaborate diagnostic procedure, in SMS it was provided by PNs as a structural part of their consultations delivered in the family practice. For the identification of eligible patients, a simple detection method became an inherent part of SMS. The eligibility criteria changed from having a mild to moderate depression towards suffering from both emotional distress and interference in their daily functioning due to the burden of diabetes. This focus on daily functioning instead of a diagnosis of depression was supposed to fit the primary care setting. Patients who were detected by the PN received the nurse-led minimal psychological intervention or were referred to the GP to see whether more specialised care would be required, depending on the severity of the symptoms.",100.0

Studies show that aerobic exercise, resistance exercise and combined programmes bring health benefits to PwMS.10,11 Hence, the programme was designed to be pragmatic and accessible, taking into account exercise preferences and giving choices. Aerobic exercise was the core exercise modality as it is accessible (i.e. includes community-based walking exercise) and does not require equipment. Participants were asked to complete short bouts (e.g. 5 × 3 minutes, with two-minute rest intervals) of low to moderate intensity aerobic exercise (e.g. stepping ergometer, cycle-ergometer, treadmill walking, rowing ergometer, arm-cranking) at 50%–69% of predicted maximum heart rate (220–age) or 12–14 on the Borg Ratings of Perceived Exertion Scale.12 Intensity was monitored continuously during exercise training sessions. As the intervention progressed, participants were encouraged to participate in longer periods of aerobic exercise (e.g. 5 × 4 minutes) or to take shorter rests between bouts.",100.0

Using the Transtheoretical Model13 as a guiding framework, this aspect of the intervention was aimed at equipping PwMS with the skills, knowledge and confidence to engage in a more physically active lifestyle. The cognitive-behavioural elements were integrated into the exercise sessions using strategies appropriate to the conversation, stage of change and concerns/questions raised by participants. Further details of the theoretical model for facilitating physical activity behaviour change have been published previously.8 Participants in the usual care group were offered three exercise sessions at the university exercise research facility and individual exercise advice after the study.",75.37313432835822

Body resistance, light weights and Therabands were used to provide resistance and one to three sets of five to 20 repetitions were performed, depending on level of disability and strength, as well as stage of the programme (exercises were progressed according to individual capabilities and strength gains). Balance board, balance exercises and exercise ball work were included where control and coordination were a problem and static stretching exercises for large skeletal muscle groups were also included in the sessions if appropriate.",100.0

To determine whether the PRT group improved more than the control group immediately after the 10-week program","To determine whether the PRT group improved more than the control group immediately after the 10-week program, data were analyzed with analysis of covariance using the baseline measures as covariates, a method that has been recommended for the analysis of continuous data measured at baseline and follow-up in randomized controlled trials.30,31 Categorical outcome variables were analyzed with relative risk ratios. To determine if the PRT group improved more than the control group 12 weeks after the program had finished and participants had been advised to not train, a separate analysis of covariance was completed on follow-up data at 22 weeks using baseline measures as covariates. Standardized mean differences (effect sizes) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated from post-intervention means and standard deviations (SD).32 To interpret the clinical significance of any statistically significant between-group differences, half the SD of the control group at baseline was accepted as representing the minimally important difference.33 Analysis was completed without Bonferroni adjustment because we decided that this would have resulted in a risk of missing real effects (type II errors) and the consequences of any type I errors would not lead to any negative effects on participants.34 Intention-to-treat analysis was applied, with all participants who were allocated and commenced their program included in analysis. Where data were missing, the carry forward technique was used.35 Analysis was repeated after a small number of extreme outliers were omitted.

One may comment on the choice of the tracking device, as Withings has not yet been validated in pwMS. We, however, think that its accuracy was sufficient to accurately track whether a training had taken place or not. We acknowledge that the study has a major selection bias. Recruited participants showed only mild walking impairment and likely had high exercise self-efficacy levels as they were willing to engage in an individual community-located running training. They may have been runners previously or being exercise ready to engage in recreational sports. As such, one may not generalize the presented methodology and effects to the whole population of pwMS. Finally, the number of adverse effects in this study, albeit fairly low, was slightly higher than in comparative studies,24,43 possibly related to the higher impact of running on the musculoskeletal system compared with a bicycle or walking training.

This can then lead to further psycho-emotional morbidity, thus establishing a vicious circle of sorts. Given that the MSSE survey measures perception, it can be suggested that higher self-efficacy scores reflect improved mood (i.e. reduced depression, anxiety and stress), and a better ability to cope with and adjust to the disease. This is supported by the work of Sinnakaruppan et al. (2010) who determined that negative perception of control was associated with decreased optimism and increased hopelessness, and Riazi et al.

As prespecified in the statistical analysis plan, Complier Average Causal Effect (CACE) sensitivity analyses were done on the 36-week AMCA scores. This method provides an unbiased estimate of the intervention effect, based on participants who complied with the standing intervention protocol.25 The agreed statistical analysis plan listed six compliance definitions that could trigger a CACE analysis25 (appendix p 2), if at least 20% of participants allocated to the intervention group were classed as non-compliers in the definition. The CACE analysis, triggered for all six definitions, used two-stage least squares instrumental variable regression, with treatment allocation as the instrument for the binary compliance variable and adjustment for baseline AMCA score, region, and EDSS category.25",100.0

Across both sites, the most successful methods of recruitment included communication from the hockey team via e-mail or social media (e.g., Twitter) and word of mouth, where 40% and 36% of men were recruited, respectively. The remaining men were recruited through traditional media sources (14%), posters and handouts (9%), and other methods (1%). There were 105 individuals assessed for eligibility, of which 24 were excluded and 1 was eligible but did not enroll. The remaining 80 individuals were eligible, completed baseline measurements, and were allocated to either intervention or comparator. One individual withdrew after randomization because he was displeased with allocation to the comparator group. The intervention group began Hockey FIT within 3 wk of baseline measurement. The number of men not attending the 12-wk measurement sessions was similar between groups (intervention group, n = 7; comparator group, n = 6) along with reasons for withdrawal (see Fig. ​Fig.1).1). Between 12 wk and 12 months (intervention group only), two individuals who had not attended the 12-wk measurement sessions returned to complete the 12-month measurement sessions and an additional five individuals were lost to follow-up. Overall, trial retention was >80% at 12 wk and >75% (intervention group only) at 12 months. Regarding program compliance, there were 10 men in the intervention group who were classified as “noncompleters” (i.e., attended <50% of sessions including none in the final 6 wk), but this did not preclude them from attending follow-up measurement sessions. For the remaining 30 men (i.e., program completers), the mean (SD) for percentage of sessions attended was 81.7% (13.7).",100.0

We examined differences between groups in mean weight loss at 12 wk using a linear mixed-effects model, including all randomized participants per group assignment (i.e., including those with missing follow-up data and regardless of compliance with the intervention) and adjusted for age and site. We retained the baseline value as part of the outcome and constrained group means as equal because of randomization (i.e., no group term) (10). The model included terms for time (0, 12 wk), group (intervention, comparator)–time, age, and site (London, Sarnia). An advantage of the mixed-effects regression modeling approach is that it does not require each participant to have the same number of measurements provided that data are missing at random (i.e., after taking observed data into account, there are no systematic differences between participants with complete data as compared with those with missing data). This is also an assumption made by using most multiple imputation methods (10). We ran an additional linear mixed-effects model within the intervention group only to obtain exploratory estimates for mean change from baseline to 12 months. We followed the same approach for all continuous outcomes unless otherwise specified. Residuals from models were examined and subjected to assumptions checks.",100.0

We analyzed the data using likelihood-based methods, which are well known to provide unbiased results under the more general assumption of missing at random (i.e., the probability of missing may depend not only on the covariates but also on the observed outcomes). This assumption is tenable because we did not find any differences between these men and the 67 who attended the 12-wk measurement sessions on characteristics such as age, weight, steps per day, healthful eating, and self-rated health. We did not adopt the method of last observation carried forward because it makes a very restrictive assumption that the outcome will be stable from the point of dropout to trial completion. One may still suspect that the data are missing not at random (i.e., the probability that a man did not return for measurement depends on his unobserved true weight). There are currently no good statistical methods without making even more assumptions for this situation (10).",100.0
