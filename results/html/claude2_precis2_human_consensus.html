<p><i><span style="border-bottom: 1px dashed black;">11 quote(s) from
publication full text</span> (mean similarity 100%)</i></p>
<pre>
Here are the PRECIS-2 domain scores and explanations for the given trial:

1. Eligibility criteria

Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Pregnant women were eligible if they were to undergo delivery by lower segment caesarean section through a transverse abdominal incision, irrespective of fever in labour, gestational age, or multiple pregnancies.&quot;</span>
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Women were not eligible if there was a clear indication for a particular surgical technique or material to be used that prevented any of the allocated interventions being used, if they had more than one previous caesarean section, or if they had already been recruited into the trial.&quot;</span>

Explanation: The eligibility criteria are quite broad, including women undergoing first or second caesarean section, irrespective of gestational age or presence of fever. The only exclusions are if there is a clear indication for a particular technique, more than one previous caesarean section, or previous recruitment into the trial. This suggests the trial intends to recruit a patient population similar to routine practice.

Score: [4] Rather pragmatic

2. Recruitment

Quotes: 
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Each participating site, advised by their research ethics committee, decided how to provide trial information to women and seek informed consent.&quot;</span>

Explanation: The paper does not provide much detail on the recruitment process. However, it seems that participants were recruited during their routine prenatal care, as the trial was discussed with eligible women and consent obtained. There is no mention of any special recruitment efforts. 

Score: [4] Rather pragmatic

3. Setting

Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;CORONIS was undertaken at 19 sites in Argentina, Chile, Ghana, India, Kenya, Pakistan, and Sudan.&quot;</span>

Explanation: The trial was conducted across multiple sites in 7 countries. The sites appear to be routine maternity care settings in these countries, rather than specialized trial or academic centers. This matches the real-world settings where caesarean sections are performed.

Score: [5] Very pragmatic

4. Organization

Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Each regional coordinator (one per country, except India, which was split into two regions) started and documented a training programme that ensured that surgeons operating within the trial were familiar with the techniques being compared before participating.&quot;</span>

Explanation: The paper mentions that surgeons received training on the techniques being compared, but does not suggest any other changes to staffing, resources, or care delivery compared to routine practice. The caesarean sections seem to have been incorporated into standard care at the participating sites.

Score: [5] Very pragmatic 

5. Flexibility: Delivery

Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;All non-allocated surgical elements and all other aspects of the caesarean section procedure were undertaken at the discretion of the surgeon.&quot;</span> 
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;In particular, there were no restrictions on the type of suture material that could be used, and standard measures to achieve haemostasis were employed regardless of the allocated intervention.&quot;</span>

Explanation: The surgeons had flexibility in how the allocated intervention was delivered along with all other aspects of care. No protocol was enforced aside from the allocated technique. This matches the flexibility found in routine practice.

Score: [5] Very pragmatic

6. Flexibility: Adherence

Quotes: None relevant

Explanation: The paper does not mention any strategies to enforce or monitor participant adherence. There is no discussion of withdrawal criteria or measures to improve adherence. 

Score: [5] Very pragmatic

7. Follow-up

Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Data were collected at trial entry, immediately after surgery, at hospital discharge (including hospital transfer or death), and at about 6 weeks after delivery.&quot;</span>
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Women who did not return at 6 weeks were located and interviewed by telephone or during a home visit.&quot;</span>

Explanation: Follow-up consisted of data collection at standard time points through 6 weeks post-delivery. Women were contacted if they did not return for the 6 week follow-up. This does not seem substantially different from routine follow-up after delivery.

Score: [4] Rather pragmatic

8. Primary Outcome

Quotes: 
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The primary outcome was a composite of death, maternal infectious morbidity, further operative procedures, or blood transfusion of more than 1 unit of whole blood or packed cells up to the 6-week follow-up visit.&quot;</span>

Explanation: The primary outcome is a composite of major maternal complications that are clinically meaningful to patients. The components would be routinely assessed in practice.

Score: [5] Very pragmatic

9. Primary Analysis

Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Women were analysed in the groups into which they were allocated.&quot;</span>

Explanation: The paper states an intention-to-treat approach was used. All randomized participants were included in the analysis in their allocated groups. No data were excluded.

Score: [5] Very pragmatic</pre>

publication full text</span> (mean similarity 99.7%)</i></p>
<pre>
Here are the PRECIS-2 domain scores and explanations for the given full text:

1. Eligibility criteria

Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Patients with a clinically established diagnosis of type 2 diabetes mellitus were sent a letter by their GPs to introduce the SMS project.&quot;</span>

The eligibility criteria seem to include all patients with type 2 diabetes who would receive the intervention in usual care. No exclusions are mentioned based on age, comorbidities, adherence, etc. This suggests a pragmatic approach.

Score: [5] 

2. Recruitment

Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Patients received the posted screening questionnaire 4–6 weeks before a planned diabetes consultation.&quot;</span> 

Patients were recruited through questionnaires mailed to their home addresses. This seems more explanatory than recruiting during routine appointments.

Score: [2]

3. Setting

Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The study was conducted between November 2011 and February 2013 and was registered in a Dutch public trial registry [NTR2764].&quot;</span>

No details are provided on the number or types of centers. Unable to assess.

Score: [NA]

4. Organization

Quote: <span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 98%):

s in the intervention arm (n=19) were trained to integrate SMS into their routine consultations.' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;PNs in the intervention arm (n=19) were trained to integrate SMS into their routine consultations.&quot;</span>

The intervention was delivered by existing practice nurses as part of routine consultations. This seems pragmatic.

Score: [4]

5. Flexibility: Delivery

Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;PNs supported patients in the processes of defining problems and finding solutions themselves, by applying problem-solving and reattribution techniques.&quot;</span>

The nurses had flexibility in how they delivered the intervention. This seems pragmatic.

Score: [4] 

6. Flexibility: Adherence

No relevant quotes. Unable to assess.

Score: [NA]

7. Follow-up

Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Outcomes were measured at baseline and at 4-month and 12-month follow-ups.&quot;</span>

Follow-up at 4 and 12 months seems reasonably pragmatic.

Score: [4]

8. Primary outcome  

Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The primary outcome measure was a dichotomised score on a Visual Analogue Scale that measured the perceived effect of diabetes on daily functioning.&quot;</span>

The primary outcome of daily functioning seems highly relevant to patients.

Score: [5]

9. Primary analysis

No details provided on analysis plan. Unable to assess.

instructions quoted (ok) or examples (unwanted beahviour)?</i></p>
<pre>
Here are the PRECIS-2 domain scores and explanations for the given full text:

Eligibility criteria 
Score: [2] Rather explanatory

Relevant quotes: 
<span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Inclusion criteria—Patients with confirmed diagnosis: ≥16 years of age with unilateral facial nerve weakness of no identifiable cause who presented to primary care or an emergency department and could be referred to a collaborating otorhinolaryngologist <72 hours after the onset of symptoms.&quot;</span>
<span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Exclusion criteria—Pregnancy, breast feeding, uncontrolled diabetes, peptic ulcer disease, suppurative otitis media, herpes zoster, multiple sclerosis, systematic infection, sarcoidosis and other rare conditions, and an inability to provide informed consent.&quot;</span>  

The eligibility criteria are rather explanatory because they exclude many patients who would be eligible in usual care, such as those with comorbidities, pregnant women, and those unable to provide informed consent. The requirement for confirmation by an otorhinolaryngologist is also not typical in usual care.

Recruitment
Score: [2] Rather explanatory

Relevant quotes:
<span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Initially extra resources were used to recruit patients at 53 primary care practices. Patients were recruited via a postal questionnaire to identify symptoms and trial eligibility, not just to invite to participate.&quot;</span>

The initial recruitment method using postal questionnaires is more explanatory because it requires additional resources not typically available in usual care. The recruitment shifted towards more pragmatic later in the trial when patients were recruited through clinic visits.

Setting
Score: [1] Very explanatory 

Relevant quotes: 
<span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Single centre and specialised centre (Madigan Army Medical Center, USA), unlikely to be the usual setting for most individuals receiving physiotherapy for shoulder impingement.&quot;</span>

Conducting the trial in a single, specialized center reduces generalizability and is very explanatory.

Organisation
Score: [5] Very pragmatic

Relevant quotes:
<span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Identical organisation to usual care, usual clinic. Same number of staff. Usual experience—fully qualified ophthalmologists who have completed general and specialist training (in ophthalmology and glaucoma, respectively) and able to perform lens extraction procedures. No additional training. No additional resources.&quot;</span>

The organization matches usual care with no additional staff, training, or resources, which is very pragmatic.

Flexibility: delivery
Score: [2] Rather explanatory

Relevant quotes:  
<span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Protocol driven—Much detail given, with protocol violations recorded in self reported case form. Investigators accept this may occur due to clinical needs (such as anaesthesia).&quot;</span>
<span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Co-interventions—Specific direction&quot;</span> 
<span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Complications—Specific directions for managing complications or side effects&quot;</span>

The protocol-driven delivery with tracking of violations and specific directions for co-interventions and complications reduces flexibility and is rather explanatory.

Flexibility: adherence
Score: [5] Very pragmatic

Relevant quote:
<span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The sessions were all individual based on interaction with child and allowed for range of responses to the intervention.&quot;</span>

Allowing flexibility in how participants engage with the intervention is very pragmatic.

Follow-up
Score: [1] Very explanatory

Relevant quotes:
<span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Clinical follow-up until patient left hospital (discharge or death) or until 30 days after surgery, whichever was the longer, so more than usual care.&quot;</span> 
<span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Monitoring intensity involved more extensive data collection than usual: Pre-operation—three-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) Holter monitor (Flashcard with 2×48 hour recording) set up on each patient and maintained for 72 hours. Troponin values at 1, 3, and 7 days after surgery (more usual for only 1 and 3 days after surgery) ECG after randomisation and at 7 and 30 days after surgery.&quot;</span>
<span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Unscheduled follow-up visits triggered by primary outcome: a cardiovascular event (such as angina, myocardial infarction, stroke)&quot;</span>

The extended follow-up period and extensive data collection including unscheduled visits triggered by the primary outcome are very explanatory.

Primary outcome
Score: [1] Very explanatory

Relevant quotes:
<span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in prompt (Similarity 99.7%):

Primary outcome—Recovery of facial function as rated on the House-Brackmann scale. • Test not routinely used in primary care and requires training. It is, however, an easy clinical test widely used in secondary care for grading recovery from facial nerve paralysis caused by damage to lower motor neurons' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;Primary outcome—Recovery of facial function as rated on the House-Brackmann scale.

<span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Central adjudication—Photographs taken of patients were assessed and graded independently by a panel of three experts (not general practitioners, who usually assess).&quot;</span>

Using an outcome not routinely measured in primary care and requiring expert adjudication makes this very explanatory.

Primary analysis
Score: [5] Very pragmatic

Relevant quote: 
<span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Intention-to-treat principle was applied with multiple imputation of data&quot;</span>

The intention-to-treat analysis is very pragmatic.</pre>

Here are the PRECIS-2 domain scores and explanations for the given trial:

Eligibility criteria 
Quotes:
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Patient selection criteria were having a diagnosis of moderate-to-severe COPD (a Body mass index, Airflow obstruction, dyspnoea and Exercise capacity [BODE] index score of 3–7) according to international guidelines and having been clinically stable for the previous 4 weeks.&quot;</span>

<span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;We think there are four steps to using PRECIS-2&quot;</span> [...] <span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Step 2: Consider your trial design choices for each of the nine PRECIS-2 domains&quot;</span>

Explanation: The eligibility criteria included patients with moderate to severe COPD based on BODE index score. Patients also had to be clinically stable for 4 weeks prior to enrollment. The criteria seem reasonably inclusive for the target population of interest.

Score: [4]

Recruitment  
Quotes:
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Recruited patients (recruitment visit, −1) attended an initial 8-week outpatient-based PR programme conducted in each hospital rehabilitation department. Following completion of this programme, patients were randomly allocated (baseline visit, 0) to either the TelePR programme [intervention group (IG)] or the standard, usual care programme [control group (CG)].&quot;</span>

Explanation: Patients were recruited when they attended the initial 8-week PR program and then randomized after completing that program. No special recruitment efforts beyond usual care are mentioned. 

Score: [4] 

Setting
Quote: 
<span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 99.3%):

This was a multicentre open-label pragmatic parallel-group randomized clinical trial involving 13 hospitals and was conducted between 2014 and 2017' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;This was a multicentre open-label pragmatic parallel-group randomized clinical trial involving 13 hospitals and was conducted between 2014 and 2017.&quot;</span>

Explanation: The trial was conducted across 13 hospitals, suggesting a reasonably diverse and pragmatic setting.

Score: [4]

Organisation
Quote:
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Patients in the IG were asked to continue at home with a similar training schedule to that completed in the hospital. They were provided with, for the 12-month follow-up period, a telerehabilitation kit (mobile phone, pulse oximeter, dumbbells and exercise bicycle) along with a user guide with detailed instructions on the use of the mobile device to deliver data collected to the web-based platform after completion of each scheduled session.&quot;</span> 

Explanation: Patients in the intervention group were provided equipment to do home-based training. This represents additional resources compared to usual care. However, it was integral to the intervention being evaluated.

Score: [3]

Flexibility: delivery
Quote: 
<span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;A highly pragmatic design would aim to slot the intervention into the usual organisation of care for the condition of interest, making use of no more than the existing healthcare staff and resources in that setting.&quot;</span>

Explanation: The delivery of the intervention appears reasonably flexible, allowing participants to complete the exercise program at home. However, some guidance was provided on performing the exercises.

Score: [4] 

Flexibility: adherence 
Quotes:
<span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;In usual care, health professionals encourage patients to take medication or follow therapy as best they can, and such encouragement would not count against a pragmatic design; if it also happens in usual care, allowing it in the trial is a pragmatic design decision.&quot;</span>

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Patients were considered non-adherent if they did not attend any 2 follow-up appointments and there was no clear clinical justification for not attending.&quot;</span>

Explanation: Some measures were in place to track adherence via follow-up appointments. But no special efforts beyond usual encouragement were made to enforce adherence.

Score: [4]

Follow-up
Quote:  
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;After the randomization visit, follow-up appointments were arranged for both groups at 3, 9 and 12 months.&quot;</span>

Explanation: Follow-up appointments were more frequent than usual care.

Score: [3]

Primary outcome
Quote:
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Exercise tolerance (the ability to sustain exercise) was assessed using distance covered in the 6MWT.&quot;</span> 

Explanation: The 6MWT is a standard and clinically meaningful measure of exercise tolerance for COPD patients.

Score: [5]

Primary analysis
Quote: 
<span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in prompt (Similarity 99.7%):

Most trials are a superiority design so the most pragmatic approach with regard to the analysis would be to make no special allowance in the analysis for non-adherence, practice variability, etc. In other words, the pragmatic approach to the analysis would typically be an intention-to-treat analysis using all available data' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;Most trials are a superiority design so the most pragmatic approach with regard to the analysis would be to make no special allowance in the analysis for non-adherence, practice variability, etc. In other words, the pragmatic approach to the analysis would typically be an intention-to-treat analysis using all available data.&quot;</span>

Explanation: The analysis appears to follow an intention-to-treat approach, but details are limited.

Score: [4]

In summary, the trial has reasonably pragmatic design choices for most domains, with some concessions made for additional follow-up and providing equipment to enable the home-based intervention. The eligibility criteria, setting, primary outcome, and analysis approach appear aligned with a pragmatic attitude.</pre>

<pre>
Here are the PRECIS-2 domain scores and explanations for the given full text:

Eligibility criteria 
Score: [4] Rather pragmatic

Relevant quotes: 
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Eighty people with Expanded Disability Status scores of 1 to 6.5 participated in this trial.&quot;</span>
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Inclusion criteria were as follows: (1) diagnosed with MS in accordance with the McDonald criteria; (2) registered at the MS outpatient clinic; (3) living in 1 of 6 selected municipalities; (4) aged 18 years or older; (5) capable of providing signed written informed consent; and (6) EDSS score between 1 and 6.5 (1 = minor disability, 6.5 = able to walk 20 m with or without a walking aid).&quot;</span>

The eligibility criteria are fairly broad, including adults with mild to moderate MS based on EDSS scores. The criteria seem to target the general MS population that would be eligible for this intervention in usual care. The inclusion of the full range of EDSS scores from 1 to 6.5 makes it more pragmatic.

Recruitment
Score: [3] Equally pragmatic and explanatory

Relevant quotes:  
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;In August 2015, 1 of the MS nurses at the Department of Neurology, Nordland Hospital Trust in Bodø, Norway, sent out invitation letters with a consent form to 160 persons with MS who were registered at the MS outpatient clinic, had EDSS scores of 0 to 7, and lived in 1 of the 6 municipalities included in the study.&quot;</span>

The participants were recruited by invitation letters sent to a registry of MS patients at a hospital clinic. This recruitment method requires some administrative effort beyond usual care. However, it still relies on patients already engaged in care for MS rather than widespread advertising or other special efforts. The recruitment path is moderately pragmatic.

Setting
Score: [5] Very pragmatic 

Relevant quotes:
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The GroupCoreDIST intervention was conducted by 6 physical therapists in 6 municipalities in Norway.&quot;</span> 

The setting of the trial matches the usual care setting, with the intervention delivered in multiple municipalities by local physical therapists. The pragmatic setting increases applicability.

Organization
Score: [4] Rather pragmatic

Relevant quote:  
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Six neurological physical therapists conducted the intervention after being trained in GroupCoreDIST for 5 days.&quot;</span>

The physical therapists received some additional training in GroupCoreDIST, but were still general neurological physical therapists like those who would deliver the intervention in usual care. The organization is fairly similar to usual care.

Flexibility: delivery
Score: [4] Rather pragmatic

Relevant quotes:
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The physical therapists had varied experience (between 7–25 years) and certification (2 had both a master’s degree in neurological physical therapy and were clinical specialists in neurological physical therapy, 1 was a clinical specialist in neurological physical therapy, and 3 were generalists in physical therapy).&quot;</span>

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The physical therapists conducted an individual clinical examination of each participant. The examinations were followed by group sessions, in which the physical therapists chose from 33 exercises, all with 5 levels of difficulty to address each individual’s impairments underlying his or her balance disturbance.&quot;</span> 

The protocol allows flexibility for therapists to choose exercises tailored to each patient's impairments and balance issues. But there is still a defined set of exercises to select from, making delivery moderately pragmatic.

Flexibility: adherence
Score: [5] Very pragmatic

Relevant quote: 
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants in the intervention group were encouraged not to seek any physical therapy other than GroupCoreDIST during the 6 weeks of the intervention.&quot;</span>

No special measures were used to enforce or monitor adherence. Patients had flexibility similar to usual care.

Follow-up
Score: [2] Rather explanatory

Relevant quotes:
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Assessments were undertaken at baseline and at weeks 7, 18, and 30.&quot;</span>

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Two assessors masked with regard to the group allocation carried out the assessments.&quot;</span>

The trial had more frequent follow-up assessments than would occur in usual care. The assessments were also done by specialized assessors masked to group allocation, making follow-up more explanatory.

Primary outcome
Score: [4] Rather pragmatic

Relevant quotes:
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Outcomes were measured with the Trunk Impairment Scale–Norwegian Version, Mini Balance Evaluation Systems Test, and Patient Global Impression of Change–Balance.&quot;</span>

The outcomes measured are clinically meaningful measures of balance and trunk control that would be relevant to patients and providers in usual practice.

Primary analysis
Score: [5] Very pragmatic

Relevant quote: 
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Repeated-measures mixed models were used for statistical analysis.&quot;</span>

The analysis appears to be a standard intention-to-treat approach, which is very pragmatic.</pre>

<p><i><span style="border-bottom: 1px dashed black;">7 quote(s) from
publication full text</span> (mean similarity 100%)</i></p>
<pre>
Here are the PRECIS-2 domain scores and explanations for the trial described in the full text:

Eligibility criteria 
Score: [3]

Relevant quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Inclusion criteria were diagnosis of PPMS or SPMS, Internet access and some level of distress determined by a score of 3 or greater on the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12).&quot;</span>

The eligibility criteria are a mix of pragmatic and explanatory. Including only patients with PPMS and SPMS matches the intended intervention population. Requiring internet access and a minimum distress score makes the sample less representative of the overall PPMS/SPMS population. Overall, the criteria are equally pragmatic and explanatory.

Recruitment
Score: [2] 

Relevant quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;We recruited potential participants through adverts on the MS Society website and from National Health Service (NHS) MS centres across the UK.&quot;</span>

Recruitment involved advertising online and at specialty clinics, which requires more effort than recruiting patients already seeking care. This explanatory approach likely results in a less representative sample.

Setting
Score: [4]

Relevant quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;We delivered the programme in eight hour-long sessions over an eight-week period via Skype video conferences.&quot;</span>

The setting of videoconference is pragmatic as it can be delivered in participants' homes, like usual care.

Organization
Score: [5]

Relevant quote: No additional organization details beyond delivery by videoconference.

The organization appears very pragmatic with no requirements for additional staffing or resources beyond videoconferencing used for delivery.

Flexibility: Delivery
Score: [4] 

Relevant quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;AB, a health psychologist, facilitated the courses. AB was supervised by PC, a clinical psychologist and expert mindfulness practitioner.&quot;</span>

The delivery allows flexibility for the therapists to adapt the mindfulness training, with oversight to ensure proper technique. This is slightly less flexible than pure usual care.

Flexibility: Adherence
Score: [5]

Relevant quote: No measures to enforce adherence are mentioned.

There appears to be no special measures to enforce adherence, so this domain is very pragmatic.

Follow-up
Score: [3]

Relevant quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Assessments occurred between January 2013 and October 2013.&quot;</span> <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The blinded assessor (SW) notified participants by email when questionnaires were due.&quot;</span>

Follow-up is done only for outcome measurement, but does require contacting patients to complete questionnaires at multiple timepoints. This is moderately pragmatic.

Primary Outcome
Score: [4]

Relevant quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The GHQ is designed to measure general levels of distress.&quot;</span> 

The GHQ measures distress which is relevant but not as directly important as concrete outcomes like symptoms or disability.

Primary Analysis
Score: [5] 

Relevant quote: No details provided, but standard intention-to-treat analysis is assumed.

In the absence of details, the analysis is assumed to be very pragmatic.</pre>

publication full text</span> (mean similarity 99.6%)</i></p>
<pre>
Here are the PRECIS-2 scores and explanations for each domain based on the provided full text:

Eligibility criteria:

Quotes:
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Inclusion criteria—age > 18, confirmed diagnosis of MS, Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS): 2.0–6.5, Six Spot Step Test (SSST) score > 8 seconds or Timed 25-Foot Walk (T25FW) > 5 seconds, relapse-free within the past 8 weeks, and no adjustment of disease-modifying medication or medication that affects gait performance and spasticity within the past 8 weeks.&quot;</span>

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Exclusion criteria—co-morbidity in terms of cognitive disorders or alcohol abuse (based on clinical judgment), pathologies that did not allow systematic PRT >1 session/week within the last 3 months.&quot;</span>

Score: [3] 

The inclusion criteria target adults with MS who have some gait impairment, which is reasonably aligned with the intended population. However, the exclusion criteria rule out some patients who would still receive the intervention in usual practice. Overall, this is a mix of pragmatic and explanatory elements.

Recruitment:

Quotes: 
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants were included from September 2016 to October 2018, after being invited via seven MS clinics (specified in “Acknowledgements” section) and targeted advertisements sent out via the Danish MS Society.&quot;</span>

Score: [2]

While some recruitment was done through MS clinics, additional effort was made through advertisements and contacting the MS Society. This extra recruitment work makes it more explanatory.

Setting:

Quotes:
<span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 96.7%):

total of 75% completed more than 15 out of the 20 sessions.' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;In total, 75% completed more than 15 out of the 20 sessions.&quot;</span> 

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Two adverse events occurred in the PRT group. One participant experienced exacerbation of fatigue following PRT sessions and dropped out; one experienced intermittent low back pain during PRT, but continued in the study.&quot;</span>

Score: [4] 

The interventions were delivered at existing physiotherapy clinics, suggesting a pragmatic setting. The reporting of some adverse events also indicates a real-world setting.

Organization:

Quotes:
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;All training sessions were supervised by physiotherapists who were trained to deliver the intervention.&quot;</span>

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Physiotherapists with experience in providing BMCT managed the programs. The therapists were instructed to aim for a level of difficulty, where the participants experienced failure but still reached successful execution in more than 50% of the attempts/time.&quot;</span>

Score: [3]

While specialized physiotherapists were used, they did not seem to require substantially more training or expertise than in usual practice. The organization is moderately pragmatic.

Flexibility (delivery):

Quotes: 
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The exercises progressed from three sets of 10 repetitions at 15 RM toward four sets of 8 repetitions at 8 RM.&quot;</span> 

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The BMCT intervention was developed based on previously published programs, and according to principle of the task-oriented approach, thus addressing salient tasks including sitting (5 minutes), standing (5 minutes), stepping (10 minutes), walking (2 × 10 minutes), and eye-movement training (10 minutes; framework illustrated in Supplemental Appendix).&quot;</span>

Score: [2] 

The PRT protocol is very structured, while the BMCT allows for some flexibility but still follows a protocol. Overall, delivery is rather explanatory.

Flexibility (adherence):

Score: [NA]

No relevant information.

Follow-up:

Quotes:
<span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 99.2%):

follow-up test was performed within 7 days of the last intervention session or after the last day of being on the waitlist.' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;A follow-up test was performed within 7 days of the last intervention session or after the last day of being on the waitlist.&quot;</span>

Score: [4] 

Follow-up was limited to a single assessment after the intervention period, similar to usual care. This is reasonably pragmatic.

Primary outcome:

Quotes: 
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Primary outcomes were the T25FW and the SSST.&quot;</span>

Score: [5]

The primary outcomes of gait speed and complex walking ability are highly relevant for MS patients. This is very pragmatic.

Primary analysis:

Score: [NA]

No details provided on the primary analysis.</pre>

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Inclusion criteria—Clinical diagnosis of MS, as defined by the modified McDonald criteria, with an Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score of 1.0–6.5, and able to walk a 10-metre distance; aged 18–65 years; clinically stable for at least four weeks prior to entering the study; physically able to participate in exercise three times per week; able to provide written informed consent.&quot;</span>

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Exclusion criteria—Comorbid conditions impairing the ability to be physically active three times per week; unwilling to be randomised; living more than 20 miles from the trial centre; already engaged in structured exercise or brisk walking ≥ 3 times per week for ≥ 30 minutes per session for at least six months.&quot;</span>

The eligibility criteria are moderately pragmatic. The inclusion criteria allow a broad range of MS patients to participate, including those with mild to moderate disability per the EDSS score range. The age range is also fairly wide. The exclusion criteria eliminate those with significant comorbidities or who already exercise regularly. Overall, the criteria aim to recruit typical MS patients who could benefit from the intervention in real world practice.

Score: [3]

Recruitment:

Relevant quote: 
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;A total of 120 PwMS were recruited via the Sheffield MS Clinic and flyers/community adverts displayed at the local South Yorkshire MS Society branches.&quot;</span>

The recruitment method is moderately pragmatic. Participants are recruited from an MS clinic, which is a real world setting, but additional recruitment is done via flyers and adverts, which requires more effort than standard practice. This likely results in a participant pool that is more motivated than the average MS patient population.

Score: [3] 

Setting:

Relevant quote:
<span title='Moderate quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 89.2%):

supervised sessions per week at a university exercise research facility' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ff9e81'>&quot;Supervised sessions took place at a university exercise research facility.&quot;</span> 

The setting is somewhat explanatory. Using a university research facility is more controlled and less like real world practice compared to holding the sessions at a local gym or therapy clinic. However, it is not as dissimilar from usual care as a specialized hospital setting would be.

Score: [2]

Organization: 

Relevant quotes:
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;An exercise physiologist supervised the delivery of the intervention but with physiotherapist input during the early stages of the programme.&quot;</span>

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Strength training was undertaken by 48 of 60 participants in the intervention group and typically involved two to six different resistance exercises (e.g. wall press-ups, arm-curls, leg abduction, wall squats and/or regular squats, knee extensions, calf raises, sit-to-stand) each session.&quot;</span>

The organization is moderately pragmatic. The intervention is delivered by an exercise physiologist and physiotherapist, which matches usual care. The strength training component is tailored to each participant's needs and involves body resistance, weights, and Therabands, which are commonly available resources. No additional staffing or training beyond typical practice is mentioned.

Score: [3]

Flexibility (delivery):

Relevant quotes: 

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Aerobic exercise was the core exercise modality as it is accessible (i.e. includes community-based walking exercise) and does not require equipment.&quot;</span>

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Where appropriate, participants also performed exercises for strength and control. The prescribed strength training was based on individual functional needs, as assessed by the trial physiotherapist (NS).&quot;</span> 

The flexibility of delivery is very pragmatic. The aerobic exercise component promotes community-based walking and other accessible activities chosen by participants. The strength training is individualized based on each participant's functional status and needs. There is no strict protocol dictating exercise type, duration, or intensity.

Score: [5]

Flexibility (adherence):

Relevant quote:
<span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 99.8%):

The homeexercise sessions were intended to mirror the supervised sessions in terms of intensity and duration of aerobic exercise, and also included tailored exercises for strength, flexibility and balance. Participants were encouraged to seek out opportunities to exercise in the local community (e.g. healthy living centres, health walks, fitness centres, swimming pools, etc.), based on their individual preferences.' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;The home-exercise sessions were intended to mirror the supervised sessions in terms of intensity and duration of aerobic exercise, and also included tailored exercises for strength, flexibility and balance. Participants were encouraged to seek out opportunities to exercise in the local community (e.g. healthy living centres, health walks, fitness centres, swimming pools, etc.), based on their individual preferences.&quot;</span>

The flexibility of adherence is very pragmatic. During the home exercise phase, participants are encouraged to perform exercises tailored to their individual needs and preferences. No special measures are mentioned to monitor or enforce adherence. Participants are free to engage in exercise in a flexible manner, mirroring real world practice. 

Score: [5]

Follow-up:

Relevant quote: 
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Outcomes were assessed at baseline, and at three months (post-intervention) and nine months after randomisation.&quot;</span>

The follow-up is moderately pragmatic. Outcomes are assessed at 3 and 9 months, which provides longer term follow-up but is still a reasonable frequency that does not greatly exceed typical practice. No details are provided about the nature or duration of the follow-up visits.

Score: [3]

Primary outcome:

Relevant quote:
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The primary outcome was self-reported exercise behaviour at three months using the Godin Leisure Time Exercise Questionnaire (GLTEQ).&quot;</span>

The primary outcome is very pragmatic. Self-reported exercise behavior is highly relevant and meaningful to participants in an exercise intervention trial. The GLTEQ is a simple questionnaire that could be easily implemented in real world practice.

Score: [5]

Primary analysis:

Relevant quote: 
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;All analyses were by intention to treat, whereby participants were analysed in the arm to which they were randomised irrespective of whether they complied with the intervention.&quot;</span> 

The primary analysis is very pragmatic. An intention-to-treat approach is used, meaning all randomized participants are included regardless of adherence or dropout. This matches real world implementation and avoids bias from excluding non-compliers.

<pre>
Here are the PRECIS-2 domain scores and explanations for the trial:

1. Eligibility criteria

Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Inclusion criteria were: age of 18 years or above; BDI score of at least 14 on two consecutive occasions and no treatment from psychologist, psychotherapist or psychiatrist within the last three months.&quot;</span>

The eligibility criteria are moderately pragmatic as adults with clinically significant depression symptoms are included, regardless of depression diagnosis. However, exclusion of those currently receiving psychological treatment makes it less pragmatic.

Score: [3] 

2. Recruitment 

Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Potential participants who were identified as having severe depression (BDI score of at least 29) or active suicidal ideas during the screening process were contacted by the study clinical psychologists and briefly assessed to understand whether the reported symptoms were typical and advised to contact their GP if deemed necessary.&quot;</span>

Recruitment was done through screening questionnaires and clinic visits, which requires some extra effort beyond usual care. However, attempts were made to refer those with severe symptoms to appropriate care. Overall moderately pragmatic.

Score: [3]

3. Setting

Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Invitations were made between October 2008 and July 2009: face-to-face by consultants in the Sheffield Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust MS clinic (n = 288); by the Sheffield MS nurses visiting patients (n = 4); and, using ink-signed personalised letters mailed out from a neuropsychologist at Sheffield (n = 40) as well as from consultant neurologists at the Walton Centre for Neurology and Neurosurgery NHS Trust, Liverpool (n = 250).&quot;</span>

Participants were recruited from MS clinics at two hospitals, which are the usual care settings. This is very pragmatic.

Score: [5] 

4. Organization

Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;In the Liverpool region, a specialist neuropsychologist, based in the acute hospital facilitated access to and provided technical advice on CCBT, but did not provide additional therapeutic input. No provision other than home-use was offered or sought.&quot;</span>

CCBT was provided through home use with some technical support, using existing staff and resources. This matches usual care and is very pragmatic.

Score: [5]

5. Flexibility: Delivery

Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Only one out of the five participating PCTs around the Sheffield centre formally provided any kind of community facility for accessing CCBT; PCT staff warned that clients rarely used the facility and it was closed during the course of the study.&quot;</span> 

The CCBT delivery protocol was flexible, allowing home use according to patient preference. No restrictions were placed on permitted co-interventions. This is very pragmatic.

Score: [5]

6. Flexibility: Adherence

Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Of the 12 patients in the CCBT arm, 9 (75%) completed at least four CCBT sessions. This translated to a reasonably high compliance rate of CCBT although only six (50%) of the patients in this arm completed all intended eight CCBT sessions.&quot;</span>

No special measures were taken to enforce adherence beyond usual encouragement. This is very pragmatic.

Score: [5]

7. Follow-up

Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The collection of outcome data by postal questionnaire proved to be challenging, with multiple attempts to obtain data from many participants, particularly at later outcome assessment points.&quot;</span>

Follow-up required some additional effort beyond usual care to maximize response rates. Moderately pragmatic. 

Score: [3]

8. Primary outcome

Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants expressed concern about the face validity, for people with MS, of the questionnaires used for the measurement of self-reported depression, including the Beck Depression Inventory II.&quot;</span> 

The BDI-II is not routinely used in usual care. A more pragmatic choice would have been a patient-important outcome like the MSIS-29. Rather explanatory.

Score: [2]

9. Primary analysis

Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Primary analysis was an Intention To Treat (ITT) analysis which analysed all 24 participants according to their randomised treatment assignment ignoring non compliance, protocol deviations and withdrawal.&quot;</span>

Full ITT analysis is very pragmatic.

Here are the PRECIS-2 domain scores and explanations for the clinical trial text provided:

1. Eligibility criteria 

Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Key inclusion criteria permitted the participation of men or women ≥18 years of age with confirmed and documented RRMS diagnosis (as defined by the Revised McDonald criteria), Kurtzke Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score of 0 to 5.5 at the screening visit, and, 30 days prior to randomization, a stable neurological condition, relapse-free status, and no use of any corticosteroid or adrenocorticotropic hormone treatment.&quot;</span>

The eligibility criteria are fairly broad, including adult men and women with confirmed RRMS diagnosis and stable disease in the past 30 days. The criteria seem reasonably similar to patients who would receive this treatment in usual care.

Score: [4] Rather pragmatic

2. Recruitment

Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Eligible patients were randomly assigned 1:1 to receive subcutaneous injections of GA40 (n = 431) or GA20 (n = 430).&quot;</span> 

Patients were recruited at 88 study centers in 14 countries. No details are provided on how patients were identified and recruited at each site. 

Score: [3] Equally pragmatic and explanatory 

3. Setting

Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The CONFIDENCE study was a multinational, multicenter, randomized, parallel-group, phase 4, open-label study conducted at 88 study centers in 14 countries (Russia, Poland, Italy, France, Croatia, US [including Puerto Rico], Mexico, Spain, Austria, Turkey, Belgium, Argentina, Germany, and Finland) across different geographic regions.&quot;</span>

The study was conducted across a range of geographic regions and practice settings, reasonably reflecting real-world settings. 

Score: [4] Rather pragmatic

4. Organization

No details are provided on resources or expertise required to deliver the interventions beyond the study centers and staff.

Score: [3] Equally pragmatic and explanatory

5. Flexibility: Delivery

No details are provided on flexibility in how the interventions were delivered.

Score: [3] Equally pragmatic and explanatory 

6. Flexibility: Adherence

No details are provided on measures to ensure adherence.

Score: [3] Equally pragmatic and explanatory

7. Follow-up

Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Five scheduled visits at study sites occurred at screening (within 2 weeks prior to baseline), baseline (Month 0), and Months 1, 3, and 6 (end of the core phase).&quot;</span>

Follow-up intensity seems reasonably similar to what would occur in usual care.

Score: [4] Rather pragmatic

8. Primary outcome  

Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The primary endpoint was patient overall satisfaction with the medication as measured by the single-item MSQ 7-point scale (1 = extremely dissatisfied to 7 = extremely satisfied)&quot;</span>

The primary outcome is directly relevant to patients.

Score: [5] Very pragmatic

9. Primary analysis

Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis set included all randomly assigned participants and were analyzed according to the treatment group to which they were randomly assigned, regardless of which treatment they actually received.&quot;</span>

An intention-to-treat analysis was used including all randomized patients.

Here are the PRECIS-2 domain scores and explanations for the trial based on the full text:

Eligibility criteria

Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;To be included, people had to be aged 18 years or more, have a confirmed diagnosis of relapsing–remitting MS, have an Ambulation Index score of 2, 3 or 4 (mild to moderate walking disabilities), and have received medical clearance to participate.&quot;</span>

Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Volunteers were excluded if they had an acute exacerbation of MS within 2 months of starting the program, had benign or progressive/relapsing types of MS, had a serious unstable medical condition, had any concurrent condition, for example stroke, or had participated in a PRT program in the 6 months before training started.&quot;</span>

The eligibility criteria are reasonably broad, including adults with relapsing-remitting MS who have mild to moderate walking disability. People with other types of MS or recent exacerbations are excluded, which limits generalizability somewhat but is appropriate for this specific trial. Overall, the criteria seem fairly pragmatic.

Score: [4]

Recruitment

Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Recruitment information flyers were sent by mail to all potential participants registered on the mailing lists of both organizations. If interested, volunteers were asked to contact one of the researchers (KD) by telephone, during which volunteers were screened to ensure they satisfied the inclusion criteria.&quot;</span>

Recruitment was done through MS organizations by mail and telephone screening. This seems like a fairly pragmatic approach that could be implemented in routine practice. No extraordinary efforts like media campaigns or incentives were used.

Score: [4] 

Setting

Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The experimental group completed a 10-week (two times per week), PRT program in one of four community gymnasiums in metropolitan and regional areas.&quot;</span>

The training took place in community gym settings, which matches the intended real-world implementation. This is a very pragmatic choice of setting.

Score: [5]

Organization

Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Each program was attended by a group of up to 12 participants, and they were supervised by up to three experienced trainers (physiotherapists and registered personal sports trainers). Each trainer directly supervised a sub-group of three or four participants.&quot;</span>

The training was delivered in small groups with typical gym staffing, using existing community gym facilities and equipment. This matches real-world implementation and is very pragmatic.

Score: [5]

Flexibility: Delivery

Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;While these were the core exercises, they could be individualized. For example, if any exercise caused discomfort, the starting position was modified or the exercise was replaced.&quot;</span> 

The exercise program was standardized but with flexibility to tailor it to each participant's needs and abilities. This pragmatic flexibility mirrors real-world practice.

Score: [4] 

Flexibility: Adherence

No measures to enforce adherence are mentioned. Participants were free to complete as many sessions as they wished with no repercussions, which is very pragmatic.

Score: [5]

Follow-up

Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Outcome measurements were taken three times: at baseline, after 10 weeks to determine the immediate effects of the intervention, and after a further 12 weeks (week 22) to determine if any benefits from the program had been sustained.&quot;</span>

Follow-up matches the intervention duration and includes an assessment 12 weeks after completion. This follow-up schedule seems pragmatic and similar to what would occur in practice.

Score: [4]

Primary outcome

Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Changes in walking endurance were measured with the 2-minute walk test (2MWT).&quot;</span> 

Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Changes in maximal walking speed were measured by recording the time taken to walk the middle 10 m of a level 14-m walkway using a stopwatch.&quot;</span>

The primary outcomes of walking endurance and speed are highly relevant functional measures for the target population. This is a very pragmatic choice.

Score: [5] 

Primary analysis

Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Intention-to-treat analysis was applied, with all participants who were allocated and commenced their program included in analysis. Where data were missing, the carry forward technique was used.&quot;</span>

The intention-to-treat analysis is appropriately pragmatic, using all available data.

Here are the PRECIS-2 domain scores and explanations for the given full text:

Eligibility criteria:

Quotes:
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Adults with MS were recruited through announcements at REVAL rehabilitation research institute (UHasselt), Flemish MS rehabilitation centers and MS Society, and Move-to-Sport. Adults diagnosed with MS were included based on the ability to walk 5 km without rest or use of assistive device.&quot;</span>

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Exclusion criteria were reports to have run 5 km in the preceding 6 months or a relapse occurring in the preceding 3 months.&quot;</span>

Explanation: The eligibility criteria are focused on adults with a diagnosis of MS who have the ability to walk 5km without assistance. This aligns with the intended real-world population that would receive this intervention. The exclusions of those who recently ran 5km or had a recent relapse seem reasonable.

Score: [4] Rather pragmatic

Recruitment:

Quote: 
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Interested pwMS attended an information session and jointly walked 5 km for verification of their ability.&quot;</span>

Explanation: Recruitment involved attending an information session and verifying ability by walking 5km jointly. This process does not seem substantially different from how participants might learn about and be recruited for such an intervention in a real-world setting.

Score: [4] Rather pragmatic  

Setting:

Quote:
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants were asked to weekly upload data to allow remote supervision of the training adherence by the research assistant. If a participant had been inactive, a phone call was made for enquiry. Besides, two group training sessions were organized (weeks 4 and 8) at a 400-m outdoor running track at KULeuven.&quot;</span>

Explanation: The setting involved primarily individual training in the community with some group sessions at an outdoor track. This seems reasonably aligned with a real-world setting for delivering this intervention.

Score: [4] Rather pragmatic

Organization:

Quote: 
<span title='Moderate quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 94.6%):

S received training instructions by email. They were asked to train three times weekly according to a personalized training intensity schedule that was based on their baseline aerobic capacity.' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ff9e81'>&quot;Participants received training instructions by email. They were asked to train three times weekly according to a personalized training intensity schedule that was based on their baseline aerobic capacity.&quot;</span>

Explanation: The organization and resources seem very similar to what would be typical in a real-world implementation - personalized instructions via email that participants carry out themselves in the community.

Score: [5] Very pragmatic

Flexibility (delivery):

Quote:
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;An illustration of a training protocol is provided in supplementary material S1. During the first weeks, training consisted of longer walking bouts, interspersed with short 1′ running bouts. The relative amount of running gradually increased until participants were able to run 5 km without interruption at 12 weeks.&quot;</span>

Explanation: There is a protocol and schedule provided to participants, but flexibility in exactly how they complete their prescribed training. This level of flexibility seems reasonable for a real-world program.

Score: [4] Rather pragmatic

Flexibility (adherence):

Quote: 
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants who completed the training program showed high adherence. The EXP group completed 607 of 648 prescribed sessions (94%).&quot;</span>

Explanation: There was monitoring of adherence, but no specific measures to enforce adherence beyond what would be typical in a real-world program.

Score: [4] Rather pragmatic

Follow-up:

Quote:
<span title='Moderate quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 93.6%):

atients were tested at two time points (0 and 12 weeks). The EXP group completed a 12-week gradual “start-torun” program in between time points. The WLC group Figure 1.

The EXP group completed a 12-week gradual “start-to-run” program in between time points. The WLC group was offered a comparable training program after the final measurements.&quot;</span>

Explanation: Follow-up matches the duration of the intervention with measures at baseline and 12 weeks. This seems very similar to what would occur in a real-world program.

Score: [5] Very pragmatic

Primary outcome:

Quote: 
<span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 99.6%):

Aerobic capacity was assessed on an electronically braked cycle ergometer (eBike Basic ® ; General Electric GmbH, Bitz, Germany) with continuous pulmonary gas exchange analysis (Oxycon, Erich Jaeger GmbH, Germany), and heart rate (HR) monitoring (Polar ®' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;Aerobic capacity was assessed on an electronically braked cycle ergometer (eBike Basic®; General Electric GmbH, Bitz, Germany) with continuous pulmonary gas exchange analysis (Oxycon, Erich Jaeger GmbH, Germany), and heart rate (HR) monitoring (Polar ®).&quot;</span>

Explanation: The primary outcome of aerobic capacity is measured directly and is highly relevant to participants in an exercise intervention study.

Score: [5] Very pragmatic

Primary analysis:

Quote:
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Intention-to-treat analysis was performed.&quot;</span>

Explanation: An intention-to-treat analysis was stated, which aligns with a very pragmatic approach.

Here are the PRECIS-2 domain scores and explanations for the given full text:

Eligibility criteria 
Relevant quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The inclusion criterion for the study was a diagnosis of multiple sclerosis, and therefore the spectrum of clinical presentations was broad, as would be expected in this client population.&quot;</span>

The inclusion criteria reflect usual care, as any MS patient would be eligible to receive massage therapy. No exclusion criteria are mentioned that would limit the participants to a narrower population than seen in usual practice.

Score: [5] 

Recruitment
Relevant quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Clients attending the clinic were interviewed, and their case histories recorded. The research project was explained, and written informed consent was obtained.&quot;</span>

Participants were recruited when they attended the clinic, reflecting how patients would access massage therapy in usual care. No additional recruitment methods were used.

Score: [5]

Setting
Relevant quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants were clients seen in the multiple sclerosis clinics at Sutherland-Chan School, in which the study was conducted.&quot;</span>

The setting was a massage therapy teaching clinic, which matches the setting where patients would receive massage therapy treatment in usual care. 

Score: [5] 

Organisation
Relevant quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;All treatment plans were approved by the clinical teacher in charge. The teacher also monitored treatment delivery, which involved the application of a variety of techniques appropriate to the client’s needs.&quot;</span>

The organisation of care delivery matches usual practice - massage therapy students delivering treatment under supervision of a clinical teacher. No additional resources or training were provided.

Score: [5]

Flexibility: delivery
Relevant quote: <span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 99.7%):

Although further work would be beneficial, the results of this study support previous findings indicating that massage therapy increases the self-efficacy of clients with multiple sclerosis, potentially resulting in a better overall adjustment to the disease and an improvement in psychoemotional state.' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;Although further work would be beneficial, the results of this study support previous findings indicating that massage therapy increases the self-efficacy of clients with multiple sclerosis, potentially resulting in a better overall adjustment to the disease and an improvement in psycho-emotional state.&quot;</span>

The massage therapy treatment was individualized based on each patient's needs, allowing for flexibility in delivery as occurs in usual care. No protocol was specified.

Score: [5]

Flexibility: adherence
Relevant quote: No relevant quotes.

No information provided on measures to enforce adherence.

Score: [NA] 

Follow-up
Relevant quote: <span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 99.6%):

For both treatment and control groups, self-efficacy scores were obtained before the first treatment, midtreatment series, after the last treatment in the series, four weeks after the final treatment and again eight weeks after the final treatment had been received.' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;For both treatment and control groups, self-efficacy scores were obtained before the first treatment, mid-treatment series, after the last treatment in the series, four weeks after the final treatment and again eight weeks after the final treatment had been received.&quot;</span>

Follow-up was more frequent than usual care to allow measurement at multiple time points.

Score: [2]

Primary outcome
Relevant quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The outcome measures for the current research were the scores yielded by the Multiple Sclerosis Self Efficacy (MSSE) survey.&quot;</span> 

The MSSE survey measures self-efficacy, which is relevant and meaningful to MS patients.

Score: [5]

Primary analysis
Relevant quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The data were analyzed on an intention to treat basis, with a focus on the differences between mean MSSE values of the control and intervention groups.&quot;</span>

An intention-to-treat analysis was used, including all participants as randomized.

<pre>
Here are the PRECIS-2 domain scores and explanations for the trial described in the full text:

Eligibility criteria 
Relevant quotes:
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Key inclusion criteria were age older than 18 years, a diagnosis of progressive multiple sclerosis (primary or secondary) according to McDonald’s criteria,21 and a score of 6·5–8·0 on the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS).&quot;</span>

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Key exclusion criteria were being within 3 months of ceasing a multiple sclerosis disease modifying drug, receiving steroid treatment within the preceding month, or participating in another clinical trial.&quot;</span>

The eligibility criteria are moderately pragmatic. The inclusion of adults with primary or secondary progressive MS with EDSS scores of 6.5-8.0 captures a relevant patient population for the intervention. However, the exclusion of those who recently ceased disease modifying drugs or steroids makes it less pragmatic. Overall, the criteria strike a balance between being inclusive while avoiding major confounders. Score: [3]

Recruitment  
Relevant quotes:  
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants were recruited through eight health care organisations, including the UK National Health Service (NHS) Trusts, social enterprises, and third sector multiple sclerosis therapy centres, in two regions (Devon–Cornwall and East Anglia) of the UK.&quot;</span>

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Individuals were invited consecutively until the allocated number of standing frames (dependent on commissioning costs) at each health care organisation had been reached.&quot;</span>

The recruitment is very pragmatic, recruiting consecutive patients from routine health care settings where they would normally receive care. No additional efforts beyond usual care were made. Score: [5] 

Setting
Relevant quotes: 
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants were recruited through eight health care organisations, including the UK National Health Service (NHS) Trusts, social enterprises, and third sector multiple sclerosis therapy centres, in two regions (Devon–Cornwall and East Anglia) of the UK.&quot;</span>

The setting is very pragmatic, conducted within the routine health care system and centers where patients would normally receive care. Score: [5]

Organization 
Relevant quotes:
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The person with multiple sclerosis and their standing assistant (typically their spouse) engaged in two face-to face, home based, 60 min physiotherapy sessions, aimed at setting up, implementing, and progressing the standing programme according to ability, supplemented by online advice and DVDs.&quot;</span> 

The organization is moderately pragmatic. The intervention is delivered at home by existing physiotherapists, but requires two 60-minute in-person training sessions, which provides more resources than typical care. Score: [3] 

Flexibility: delivery
Relevant quotes:
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;In line with previous research,14 participants were asked to stand in the frame for 30 min three times per week over 20 weeks, and to record the frequency and duration of each stand in a daily diary.&quot;</span>

The flexibility of delivery is moderately pragmatic. There is a recommended standing duration and frequency, but participants recorded actual standing times, allowing for flexibility. Score: [3]

Flexibility: adherence 
Relevant quotes:
No relevant quotes.

No information provided on measures to enforce adherence. Score: [NA] 

Follow-up
Relevant quotes:  
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Outcome assessors (research therapists) were masked to treatment allocation, and all assessments were done independently and away from the participant’s home.&quot;</span>

The follow-up is very pragmatic. Outcomes were assessed independently in a masked manner, separate from treatment delivery. No additional in-person visits were required. Score: [5]

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The primary outcome was motor function as measured by the Amended Motor Club Assessment (AMCA) score23 at the primary endpoint of 36 weeks post-randomisation.&quot;</span>

The primary outcome is very pragmatic, using a measure of motor function that is clinically meaningful to patients. Score: [5]

Primary analysis
Relevant quotes:
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The primary analysis of the primary outcome, AMCA score at 36 weeks, followed a modified intention-to treat approach, regardless of compliance to the intervention, but did exclude patients who were deemed ineligible after randomisation, those who withdrew from the trial and were unwilling for their previously collected data to be used, or those who did not provide baseline and week 36 measurements (ie, there was no imputation of missing baseline or week 36 scores for the primary analysis), and used an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) approach.&quot;</span>

The primary analysis is moderately pragmatic. It is an intention-to-treat approach with some exclusions, which is reasonably pragmatic but not fully inclusive of all randomized participants. Score: [4]</pre>

<p><i><span style="border-bottom: 1px dashed black;">7 quote(s) from
publication full text</span> (mean similarity 99.9%)</i></p>
<pre>
Here are the PRECIS-2 domain scores and explanations for the trial described in the full text:

1. Eligibility criteria

Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Eligible participants were over 18 years of age and had a diagnosis of MS that was confirmed by a consultant physician or neurologist.&quot;</span>

Score: [4] Rather pragmatic

The eligibility criteria are fairly broad, including adults over 18 with a diagnosis of MS confirmed by a physician. This is similar to criteria that would be used in usual practice. Some exclusions are made for safety reasons like recent relapse or pregnancy. Overall, the criteria seem intended to include typical MS patients who would receive this intervention in routine care.

2. Recruitment

Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants were referred to the project by themselves, their care-giver, MSI, chartered physiotherapists, neurologists, general practitioners or clinical nurse specialists.&quot;</span> 

Score: [4] Rather pragmatic

Participants were recruited through usual healthcare providers and self-referral. No extraordinary efforts like media campaigns or incentives were used. This matches typical recruitment in routine practice.

3. Setting

Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;All interventions took place in groups of eight, for an hour per week, for 10 weeks. They were delivered in community centres such as local gyms, hotels and health centres.&quot;</span>

Score: [5] Very pragmatic 

The interventions took place in community settings like gyms and health centers, which matches the real-world setting where MS patients would receive these interventions as part of routine care.

4. Organization

Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The PT-led exercise provided was pre-defined. It consisted of a circuit-style class of exercises that were either resisted by body weight or by the addition of free weights.&quot;</span>

Score: [3] Equally pragmatic and explanatory

The PT-led intervention was standardized, while the yoga and fitness instructor interventions were not predefined. Overall, it seems the expertise and resources used were fairly similar to what would be available in routine practice.

5. Flexibility: Delivery

Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The yoga and FI-led classes were not defined, as this pragmatic trial aimed to establish the effectiveness and content of these interventions in the manner that people with MS would likely encounter them within the community.&quot;</span>

Score: [4] Rather pragmatic

The yoga and fitness classes allowed flexibility in delivery, while the PT class followed a standardized protocol. But overall there was reasonable flexibility similar to routine practice.

6. Flexibility: Adherence

No relevant quotes.

Score: [NA] 

Adherence is not discussed in the text.

7. Follow-up

Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Outcome was assessed at week 24 for the intervention groups only, as it was felt that withholding a potentially beneficial treatment for longer than 12 weeks, from the controls, could be considered unethical.&quot;</span>

Score: [3] Equally pragmatic and explanatory

Follow-up was done at 12 and 24 weeks to assess outcomes. This is more frequent than usual care but reasonable for a trial.

8. Primary outcome

Quote: <span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 99.5%):

The primary outcome measure was the physical component of the Multiple Sclerosis Impact Scale29, version 2 (MSIS-29v2), a patient-reported outcome measure that assesses the physical impact of MS.' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;The primary outcome measure was the physical component of the Multiple Sclerosis Impact Scale-29, version 2 (MSIS-29v2), a patient-reported outcome measure that assesses the physical impact of MS.&quot;</span>

Score: [4] Rather pragmatic

The primary outcome of physical impact is clinically meaningful to patients. The MSIS-29v2 scale is validated and used in routine practice.

9. Primary analysis

No relevant quotes.

Score: [NA] 

The analysis method is not described in the text.</pre>

Here are the PRECIS-2 domain scores and explanations for the given clinical trial text:

Eligibility criteria 
Score: [2] Rather explanatory

Relevant quotes: 
<span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Inclusion criteria—Patients with confirmed diagnosis: ≥16 years of age with unilateral facial nerve weakness of no identifiable cause who presented to primary care or an emergency department and could be referred to a collaborating otorhinolaryngologist <72 hours after the onset of symptoms.&quot;</span>

<span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Exclusion criteria—Pregnancy, breast feeding, uncontrolled diabetes, peptic ulcer disease, suppurative otitis media, herpes zoster, multiple sclerosis, systematic infection, sarcoidosis and other rare conditions, and an inability to provide informed consent.&quot;</span> 

<span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Extra test—Randomised controlled trial of Bell’s palsy treatment required senior otorhinolaryngologist in hospitals to confirm a patient’s eligibility to participate. Bell’s palsy is usually diagnosed by a general practitioner in primary care.&quot;</span>

The eligibility criteria are rather explanatory because they exclude many patients who would receive this intervention in usual care, such as those with comorbidities. The extra test of requiring confirmation by a specialist is also not typical in usual care.

Recruitment

Setting
Score: [NA] No relevant quotes provided. 

Organisation
Score: [NA] No relevant quotes provided.

Flexibility: delivery
Score: [NA] No relevant quotes provided.

Flexibility: adherence

Follow-up
Score: [1] Very explanatory

Relevant quotes:
<span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Clinical follow-up until patient left hospital (discharge or death) or until 30 days after surgery, whichever was the longer, so more than usual care.&quot;</span>

<span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Monitoring intensity involved more extensive data collection than usual: Pre-operation—three-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) Holter monitor (Flashcard with 2×48 hour recording) set up on each patient and maintained for 72 hours. Troponin values at 1, 3, and 7 days after surgery (more usual for only 1 and 3 days after surgery) ECG after randomisation and at 7 and 30 days after surgery.&quot;</span>

<span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Unscheduled follow-up visits triggered by primary outcome: a cardiovascular event (such as angina, myocardial infarction, stroke)&quot;</span>

The follow-up is very explanatory because it is more frequent and extensive than usual care, with additional tests and visits triggered by the primary outcome event.

Primary outcome
Score: [2] Rather explanatory 

Relevant quotes:
<span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Primary outcome—Recovery of facial function as rated on the House-Brackmann scale.&quot;</span> 

<span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Test not routinely used in primary care and requires training. It is, however, an easy clinical test widely used in secondary care for grading recovery from facial nerve paralysis caused by damage to lower motor neurons.&quot;</span>

<span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Central adjudication—Photographs taken of patients were assessed and graded independently by a panel of three experts (not general practitioners, who usually assess).&quot;</span>

The primary outcome is rather explanatory because the House-Brackmann scale is not routinely used in primary care, requires special training, and uses central adjudication rather than assessment by the usual care provider.

<pre>
Here are the PRECIS-2 domain assessments for the given full text:

Eligibility criteria:

Relevant quotes:
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;A total of 164 patients with MS referred themselves after having received information via the outpatient neurology clinic of the University Hospital Basel, other physicians, or advertisements posted in the Swiss Multiple Sclerosis Society Bulletin.&quot;</span>

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Neurologists verified all patients for the following inclusion criteria: 1) diagnosis of relapsing-remitting (but no more than 2 exacerbations within the last year) or secondary progressive MS and 2) an Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score of ≤6 (no to moderately severe disability), with ≤1 step increase within the last year.&quot;</span>  

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Excluded were patients with reported or medically recorded diagnoses of current serious psychological disorders other than depression and anxiety syndromes, evidence of dementia as indicated by testing below the fifth percentile in at least 3 of 6 dimensions of neuropsychological functioning (i.e., attention and concentration, processing speed, executive function, verbal memory, and verbal processing), other currently life-threatening or severely disabling physical disorders, current MS exacerbation, symptomatic MS medication altered in the last 3 months, other disorders of the CNS, pregnancy, or inability to speak or read German.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The eligibility criteria seem moderately pragmatic. Patients had to have a diagnosis of relapsing-remitting or secondary progressive MS, with some limitations on disability level and recent exacerbations. However, some patients were excluded, like those with serious psychological disorders, dementia, other disabling disorders, medication changes, etc. Overall, the criteria exclude some patients who may receive the intervention in usual care, but still target a reasonably broad MS population.

Score: [3]

Recruitment:

Relevant quotes:
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;A total of 164 patients with MS referred themselves after having received information via the outpatient neurology clinic of the University Hospital Basel, other physicians, or advertisements posted in the Swiss Multiple Sclerosis Society Bulletin.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: Patients self-referred after seeing information from various medical and community sources. This seems moderately pragmatic - some effort was made to recruit broadly, but patients still had to proactively contact the study team rather than being approached directly. 

Score: [3] 

Setting: 

Relevant quotes:
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The study was conducted from February 2007 to March 2009.&quot;</span>

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The study was approved by the Ethics Commission of Both Basels and is registered at www.controlled-trials.com, ISRCTN21643919.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The study was conducted at the University Hospital Basel in Switzerland. No details are provided on how many sites were involved. Conducting the study at a single academic medical center makes the setting more explanatory.

Score: [2]

Organisation:

Relevant quotes: None relevant.

Reasoning: No details are provided on the expertise, resources, or care delivery model used to implement the intervention.

Score: [NA] 

Flexibility (delivery):

Relevant quotes:  
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;MBI closely followed the program of mindfulness-based stress reduction and included 1) a personal intake interview to define realistic goals of participants and establish personal rapport; 2) 8 weekly 2.5-hour classes in mindfulness practices (10–15 participants/group; exercises did not exceed patients’ level of functioning); 3) one Saturday, 7-hour session at week 6; 4) homework assignments (approximately 40 minutes/day), emphasized as essential to success of the program; 5) a postintervention interview to evaluate personal experiences, goal attainment, and future maintenance of acquired skills. Each class covered specific exercises and topics within the context of mindfulness training, i.e., practices during lying, sitting, and dynamic yoga postures, as well as during everyday life, e.g., stressful situations and social interactions. Mindfulness exercises included observation of sensory, affective, and cognitive domains of perceptible experience. The all-day retreat integrated familiar exercises and presented new ones. In all, 6 MBI courses for the experimental arm of the study were individually conducted by 2 experienced, certified teachers, each with ≥9 years teaching experience.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The delivery of the mindfulness intervention seems moderately explanatory - it follows a structured program with classes, a retreat, and homework. However, some flexibility was allowed in the specific exercises and topics covered to meet patients' needs.

Score: [2]

Flexibility (adherence):

Relevant quotes: None relevant.

Reasoning: No details are provided on measures to enforce or improve adherence.

Score: [NA]

Follow-up:

Relevant quotes:  
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Reported outcome measurements occurred within 2 weeks before and after intervention and 6 months postintervention.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: Outcomes were assessed at baseline, post-intervention, and 6 months. This follow-up schedule seems moderately pragmatic as it allows assessment after a reasonably long period but does not appear excessive.

Score: [3]

Primary outcome:

Relevant quotes:
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Primary outcomes included disease-specific and disease-aspecific HRQOL, depression, and fatigue.&quot;</span>

<span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 99.4%):

HRQOL was assessed with 2 inventories, one developed for patients with chronic disorders (i.e., diseaseaspecific) and the other specifically for patients with MS.' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;HRQOL was assessed with 2 inventories, one developed for patients with chronic disorders (i.e., disease-aspecific) and the other specifically for patients with MS.&quot;</span> 

Reasoning: The primary outcomes of HRQOL, depression, and fatigue are patient-centered and clinically meaningful. Using both a disease-specific and a general chronic disease HRQOL measure is a pragmatic choice.

Score: [4] 

Primary analysis:

Relevant quotes:  
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Intention-to-treat analyses are reported. Data of missing study patients were imputed by linear multiple regression that adjusted for age, gender, and disease progression (entry EDSS score; STATISTICA 6.0).&quot;</span>

Reasoning: An intention-to-treat approach was used with imputation of missing data. This is a pragmatic analysis approach.

Here are the PRECIS-2 domain scores and explanations for the given full text:

Eligibility criteria 
Score: [2] Rather explanatory

Relevant quote: <span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Inclusion criteria—Patients with confirmed diagnosis: ≥16 years of age with unilateral facial nerve weakness of no identifiable cause who presented to primary care or an emergency department and could be referred to a collaborating otorhinolaryngologist <72 hours after the onset of symptoms.&quot;</span>

This trial has strict inclusion criteria requiring laboratory confirmation of diagnosis and referral to a specialist, which would not reflect eligibility in usual care where Bell's palsy is often diagnosed clinically by a general practitioner. The age limit and short time window for enrollment also make the sample less representative.

Recruitment
Score: [2] Rather explanatory 

Relevant quote: <span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Initially extra resources were used to recruit patients at 53 primary care practices. Patients were recruited via a postal questionnaire to identify symptoms and trial eligibility, not just to invite to participate.&quot;</span>

Recruitment via postal questionnaire to screen for eligibility is more explanatory than recruiting during routine clinic visits, as it requires additional resources and may bias the sample towards more motivated and adherent participants.

Setting
Score: [1] Very explanatory

Relevant quote: <span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Single centre and specialised centre (Madigan Army Medical Center, USA), unlikely to be the usual setting for most individuals receiving physiotherapy for shoulder impingement.&quot;</span>

Conducting the trial in a single specialized center reduces generalizability of findings to other settings.

Organization
Score: [3] Equally pragmatic and explanatory

Relevant quote: <span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Information sheets given out to participants. This is not usual practice, would it be if trial had shown this helped? Need more staff for follow up of trial participants to get diary results so more extensive data collection than usual. Otherwise no difference in provider expertise and organisation of care delivery.&quot;</span>

While some additional staffing was required for data collection, expertise and resources were generally similar to usual care. The impact on organization seems balanced between pragmatic and explanatory elements.

Flexibility: delivery
Score: [5] Very pragmatic

Relevant quote: <span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The sessions were all individual based on interaction with child and allowed for range of responses to the intervention&quot;</span>

Leaving flexibility in how the intervention is delivered matches usual practice.

Flexibility: adherence 
Score: [5] Very pragmatic

Relevant quote: No measures to enforce or monitor adherence are mentioned.

Allowing flexibility in adherence without special efforts to enforce or monitor it is very pragmatic.

Follow-up
Score: [2] Rather explanatory

Relevant quote: <span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Clinical follow-up until patient left hospital (discharge or death) or until 30 days after surgery, whichever was the longer, so more than usual care.&quot;</span> 

Following patients for a longer fixed period than usual care makes follow-up more explanatory.

Primary outcome
Score: [1] Very explanatory 

Relevant quote: <span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in prompt (Similarity 99.3%):

Primary outcome—Recovery of facial function as rated on the House-Brackmann scale. • Test not routinely used in primary care and requires training' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;Primary outcome—Recovery of facial function as rated on the House-Brackmann scale. Test not routinely used in primary care and requires training.&quot;</span>

Using an outcome scale not routinely used in primary care settings reduces applicability.

Primary analysis
Score: [5] Very pragmatic

Relevant quote: <span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Intention-to-treat principle was applied with multiple imputation of data&quot;</span>

An intention-to-treat analysis with all available data is very pragmatic.</pre>

<p><i><span style="border-bottom: 1px dashed black;">11 quote(s) from
publication full text</span> (mean similarity 100%)</i></p>
<pre>
Here are the PRECIS-2 domain scores and explanations for the trial:

1. Eligibility criteria 

Score: [2] Rather explanatory

Relevant quotes:
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Inclusion criteria were patients in South East London, living with MS and deemed (by clinicians) to have one or more of unresolved symptoms, psychosocial concerns, end-of-life issues, progressive illness, or complex needs (i.e., palliative care needs).&quot;</span>

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Exclusion criteria included if the referring staff or the screening deemed patients had very urgent needs or were deteriorating rapidly when immediate referral to the service was offered.&quot;</span>

The eligibility criteria are rather explanatory because patients were screened by clinicians and had to have specific palliative care needs to be included. Patients with very urgent needs were excluded, further limiting the participants to a specific subset of MS patients. This differs from a very pragmatic approach where any MS patient could participate.

2. Recruitment

Score: [3] Equally pragmatic and explanatory 

Relevant quotes: 
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Subjects were 69 people with MS, 52 of whom took part in the trial.&quot;</span>

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Referrals were screened by a consultant in palliative medicine who was independent from delivering the service.&quot;</span> 

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Educational seminars informed local health and social care professionals about the PCT.&quot;</span>

The recruitment is a mix of pragmatic and explanatory elements. Patients were referred by their regular clinicians, which is pragmatic. However, informational seminars were used to encourage referrals and patients were further screened, making recruitment more targeted than just routine referrals. Overall this seems equally pragmatic and explanatory.

3. Setting

Score: [5] Very pragmatic

Relevant quote: 
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Patients in South East London, living with MS&quot;</span>

The setting of patients' homes in South East London is very pragmatic, as this is the real-world setting where MS patients live and receive usual care.

4. Organization

Score: [4] Rather pragmatic

Relevant quote:
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;In addition to continuing to receive usual services, patients in the fast-track group received care from a PCT. This comprised one part-time consultant in palliative medicine, one part-time clinical nurse specialist, one administrator, and one psychosocial worker.&quot;</span>

The organization is rather pragmatic - patients received the intervention at home from a small palliative care team in addition to their usual care. It did not require substantially more resources or expertise than available in usual practice.

5. Flexibility: delivery

Score: [4] Rather pragmatic

Relevant quote:  
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Patients had one to three contacts (visits and/or phone calls) from the PCT, although a small number (around 12%) were referred for longer-term ‘‘community’’ palliative care.&quot;</span>

The delivery seems rather pragmatic - the palliative care team provided 1-3 visits tailored to each patient's needs, with flexibility similar to usual practice.

6. Flexibility: adherence

Score: [5] Very pragmatic

No relevant quotes. The trial does not mention any measures to enforce or monitor adherence. As an outpatient intervention, adherence measures are not applicable.

7. Follow-up

Score: [2] Rather explanatory

Relevant quotes:
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;We conducted face-to-face interviews with patients and gave self-complete questionnaires to caregivers. At baseline, we collected demographic and clinical data, and the patient’s functional status. We collected outcome and cost data at baseline (before randomization) and at 6, 12, 18 (only control groupdafter they received PCT), and 24 weeks.&quot;</span>

The follow-up is rather explanatory because patients were interviewed frequently (5 times over 6 months) with extensive data collection at each timepoint. This is more intensive than would occur in usual practice.

8. Primary outcome

Score: [4] Rather pragmatic 

Relevant quotes:
<span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 99.7%):

Our standardized questionnaires included the Palliative Care Outcome Scale (POS8), 24,25 comprising eight questions on anxiety, patient and carer concerns, and practical needs, each rated 0e4; a single-item POS pain score (rated 0 [best] to 4 [worst]); and caregivers’ burden (using the 12-item version of the Zarit Carer Burden Inventory [ZBI]).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;Our standardized questionnaires included the Palliative Care Outcome Scale (POS-8), comprising eight questions on anxiety, patient and carer concerns, and practical needs, each rated 0e4; a single-item POS pain score (rated 0 [best] to 4 [worst]); and caregivers’ burden (using the 12-item version of the Zarit Carer Burden Inventory [ZBI]).&quot;</span>

The primary outcomes of pain, anxiety, caregiver burden and needs are rather pragmatic as they are patient-centered and important to recipients of palliative care in real-world practice. The scales used are clinically relevant.

9. Primary analysis

Score: [5] Very pragmatic

Relevant quote: 
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;We planned an intention-to-treat analysis, irrespective of whether patients were assessed as having palliative care needs or the nature of contact with the PCT.&quot;</span>

The intention-to-treat analysis is very pragmatic, consistent with analyzing the effect of the intervention under real-world conditions.</pre>

Here are the PRECIS-2 domain scores and explanations for the given clinical trial text:

1. Eligibility criteria

Quotes:
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Eligibility criteria for patients: diagnosis RRMS since at least one year, EDSS score ≤4.0, no symptoms suggestive of a relapse, no relapse in the preceding four weeks, willing and capable of participating in the investigations, and having access to the internet for performing the web-based assessments.&quot;</span>

<span title='Moderate quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 92%):

was not confirmed by a neurologist. The criterion of EDSS �4.0 was checked by assessing whether the patient was self-sufficient and able to walk �500 meters without aid or rest [11].' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ff9e81'>&quot;The MS diagnosis was not confirmed by a neurologist. The criterion of EDSS ≤4.0 was checked by assessing whether the patient was self-sufficient and able to walk ≥500 meters without aid or rest [11].&quot;</span>

The eligibility criteria are reasonably broad, including RRMS patients with low disability (EDSS ≤4.0) who are 1 year post-diagnosis. The diagnosis was made based on self-report rather than neurologist confirmation. The EDSS score was verified by assessing walking ability. Some patients with higher disease activity may have been excluded due to the no relapse criteria. Overall, the criteria seem moderately pragmatic.

Score: [3] 

2. Recruitment

Quotes:
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants were recruited from all over the Netherlands by the patient organisation NMSF, Rotterdam, the Netherlands.&quot;</span>

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Interested patients were contacted by a registered nurse experienced in MS (MH) by phone to check diagnosis and eligibility criteria.&quot;</span>

Patients were recruited nationwide in the Netherlands through a patient organization. Eligibility was verified through phone screening. No other recruitment methods like advertising or incentives were mentioned. Recruitment through a patient organization and phone screening seem consistent with a moderately pragmatic approach.

Score: [3]

3. Setting

Quote: 
<span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 97.8%):

CDT was given during three consecutive days in Zorghotel Spelderholt, Beekbergen, the Netherlands, a facility especially equipped for the accommodation of people with impaired health.' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;CDTs were given during three consecutive days in Zorghotel Spelderholt, Beekbergen, the Netherlands, a facility especially equipped for the accommodation of people with impaired health.&quot;</span>

The intervention was delivered at a specialized facility for people with impaired health. This setting may provide additional resources compared to usual care. However, for a short-term intervention, the setting does not seem substantially different from usual care.

Score: [4] 

4. Organization

Quotes:
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The multidisciplinary team included a psychiatrist, psychiatric nurse, neurologist, registered nurse specialized in MS, physiotherapist, dance therapist, and a person with MS [9].&quot;</span>

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;All professional team members were formally trained in their respective disciplines and all members were experienced in the field of MS.&quot;</span> 

The intervention was delivered by a specialized, multidisciplinary team. The providers likely had more expertise than typical providers. Additional training and supervision was provided. This level of resources and expertise exceeds usual care.

Score: [2]

5. Flexibility: delivery

Quotes:
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;CDT focuses on the exploration of those stressors that confine patients to their physical, psychological or social roles regarding their disease and limitations; reduces relevant stressors; explores and pushes personal boundaries; and creates new personal boundaries by making optimal use of the existing potential [9].&quot;</span>

<span title='Moderate quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 90.7%):

components are large group sessions, small group sessions, consultations (carrousel), a theatre evening, and start of the day with a joint activity' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ff9e81'>&quot;Components include group sessions, consultations, a theater evening, and optional joint activity.&quot;</span>

The intervention involves a standardized protocol with multiple structured components. However, the content appears individually tailored to each patient's stressors and goals. There is likely some flexibility in delivery while maintaining a coherent overall approach.

Score: [3] 

6. Flexibility: adherence

Quote: 
<span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;A highly pragmatic design approach would allow for full flexibility in how end user recipients engage with the intervention.&quot;</span>

The text does not mention any specific measures to enforce or monitor adherence. As a multiday psychosocial intervention, participants likely needed to attend the full program, but flexibility within the sessions was presumably allowed. Without further detail, the flexibility seems moderately pragmatic. 

Score: [3]

7. Follow-up

Quotes:
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Assessments were at baseline and at one, three and six months follow-up via online questionnaires.&quot;</span>

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The completion of the questionnaires took about 45 minutes and for partners about five minutes per time point.&quot;</span>

Follow-up assessments were done at 1, 3, and 6 months post-intervention via online questionnaires. This schedule exceeds typical follow-up frequency in usual care. However, the time commitment was reasonably low. The follow-up intensity seems moderately pragmatic.

Score: [3]

8. Primary outcome

Quote:
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The primary study outcome was the change in control self-efficacy, assessed by the Multiple Sclerosis Self-Efficacy Scale (MSSES)&quot;</span>

The primary outcome was change in self-efficacy measured by a validated scale. This patient-centered outcome is clinically meaningful.

Score: [4] 

9. Primary analysis

Quote: 
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;All endpoints were analyzed according to the intention-to-treat principle&quot;</span>

An intention-to-treat analysis was used including all randomized patients. This pragmatic approach is appropriate for the study aims.

Here are the PRECIS-2 domain assessments for the given full text:

Eligibility criteria:

Relevant quotes:
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Inclusion criteria were: 1) having a definite diagnosis of MS from a neurologist; 2) being within 5 years of receiving a diagnosis of MS; 3) scoring at least 10 on the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II); 4) not currently undertaking other psychological treatment for depressive or anxiety symptoms for the length of participation in the current trial; 5) speak English fluently; 6) no current or lifetime diagnosis of psychosis; 7) no current substance dependency; 8) no gross cognitive impairment; and 9) no changes to medications prior and during involvement in the trial.&quot;</span>

The eligibility criteria are quite restrictive, excluding those with psychosis, substance dependency, cognitive impairment, and those already receiving psychological treatment. The criteria seem aimed at selecting participants likely to respond well and adhere to the intervention. The BDI-II cutoff also selects those with at least mild depression. Overall, this results in a participant sample less representative of the wider MS population who would receive this intervention in usual care.

Score: [2]

Recruitment:

Relevant quotes: 
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants were recruited through neurologists working in a large MS outpatient clinic at the hospital, advertisements on MS related websites and local press releases.&quot;</span>

The recruitment methods go beyond typical referral at a MS clinic. Additional effort is made through website/press advertising. This results in a sample less representative of the clinic population.

Score: [2] 

Setting:

Relevant quotes:
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The study took place at a large teaching and research hospital in Melbourne, Australia. Participants were recruited through neurologists working in a large MS outpatient clinic at the hospital.&quot;</span>

The single-center hospital setting is more specialized than the typical setting where patients receive MS care. This reduces generalizability.

Score: [2]

Organization:

Relevant quotes:
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;A senior clinical psychologist and a provisional clinical psychologist (supervised by the clinical psychologist) provided the intervention.&quot;</span>

The intervention is delivered by clinical psychologists with expertise in CBT. This level of provider expertise may not be available in typical care settings.

Score: [3]

Flexibility (delivery):

Relevant quotes:
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The CBT intervention consisted of 8 individual modules which focused on CBT based principles and strategies. These strategies included progressive muscle relaxation, controlled breathing exercises, pleasant activity scheduling, problem solving skills, cognitive exercises which helped individuals identify, challenge and manage unhelpful thoughts and beliefs. For the intervention, a therapy manual was developed by the first author, which included tailored modules and skills for MS patients.&quot;</span>

The intervention follows a structured manualized protocol over 8 sessions. This reduces flexibility in delivery compared to typical psychological care.

Score: [2]

Flexibility (adherence): 

No relevant quotes. The text does not mention any measures to enforce or monitor adherence.

Score: [NA]

Follow-up:

Relevant quotes: 
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;All participants completed questionnaires at pre- and post-treatment and at 20 weeks follow up.&quot;</span>

Follow-up assessments are more frequent than typical care. However, they are limited and unlikely to impact adherence or outcomes.

Score: [4]

Primary outcome:

Relevant quotes:
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The primary outcome was level of depressive symptoms at post and 3 month follow up which was measured with the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II).&quot;</span>

The BDI-II directly measures depressive symptoms, which is a relevant outcome for participants.

Score: [5] 

Primary analysis:

Relevant quotes:
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;All statistical analyses included a sample of 30 participants at pre, post and 20 weeks follow up.&quot;</span>

All randomized participants were included in the analysis. This is consistent with an intention-to-treat approach.

Score: [5]</pre>

<p><i><span style="border-bottom: 1px dashed black;">9 quote(s) from
publication full text</span> (mean similarity 100%)</i></p>
<pre>
Here are the PRECIS-2 domain scores and explanations for the given clinical trial text:

1. Eligibility criteria 

Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants had a confirmed diagnosis of multiple sclerosis, an Extended Disability Status Scale score of 5 (ambulatory without aid or rest for about 200 m) to 6.5 (constant bilateral assistance required to walk about 20 m without resting), stable rehabilitation and drug therapy for 30 days before entry into the study, cognitive scores of over 24 on the Mini-Mental State Examination and access to the intervention sites using their own or public transport.&quot;</span>

The eligibility criteria are moderately pragmatic as they include patients typical of those who would receive this intervention in usual care - adults with moderate multiple sclerosis able to walk short distances. However, the narrow range on the EDSS scale makes it less pragmatic. 

Score: [3]

2. Recruitment

Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Of the 873 patients on the clinical register for multiple sclerosis 159 patients were deemed suitable for the study. These people were sent invitation letters and participant information sheets. Forty-three potential participants expressed an interest in participating.&quot;</span>

The recruitment method of using a clinical register to identify and invite potential participants is moderately pragmatic as this registry would likely be used to identify patients for the intervention in real world practice. 

Score: [3] 

3. Setting

Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The intervention took place at two different geographical locations (Site A and Site B).&quot;</span>

Conducting the trial at two community leisure centers makes the setting moderately pragmatic compared to real world care. However, limiting it to only two sites reduces pragmatism.

Score: [3]

4. Organization

Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Each group was led by two instructors (one physiotherapist and one fitness instructor). The same physiotherapist was present at both sites; however fitness instructors were different between sites.&quot;</span>

Using one physiotherapist and one fitness instructor to deliver the intervention is moderately pragmatic as it utilizes staffing that would be available in real world practice.

Score: [3]

5. Flexibility: Delivery

Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Through discussion with the instructors, participants chose which level of each exercise they deemed appropriate and also when and how each exercise should be progressed. Participants worked at a self-regulated pace for each exercise.&quot;</span>

Allowing flexibility in how the exercises were delivered based on participants' needs and self-regulated pace is very pragmatic, similar to real world practice.

Score: [5] 

6. Flexibility: Adherence

Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The group session involved a 10-minute warm-up of aerobic and stretching components, 30–40 minutes of circuit exercises (Appendix 1 on-line), designed to train aerobic endurance, resistance and balance, and a 5–10 minute cool-down, involving aerobic work, stretching and relaxation.&quot;</span>

No special measures were described to enforce or monitor adherence. This is very pragmatic, similar to real world practice.

Score: [5]

7. Follow-up

Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Outcome measures were carried out within the local hospital’s rehabilitation unit. They were taken at baseline, after 8 and 12 weeks of the intervention period (i.e. either the exercise class or usual care).&quot;</span>

Follow-up at 8 and 12 weeks is more frequent than would occur in usual care, making this moderately explanatory.

Score: [2]

8. Primary outcome

Quote: <span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 99.6%):

The Timed 25Foot Walk Test measures walking speed over a short distance and has shown good reliability and validity in the multiple sclerosis population as an individual component of the Multiple Sclerosis Functional Composite disability assessment.' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;The Timed 25-Foot Walk Test measures walking speed over a short distance and has shown good reliability and validity in the multiple sclerosis population as an individual component of the Multiple Sclerosis Functional Composite disability assessment.&quot;</span> 

The timed 25-foot walk test is a clinically meaningful outcome for participants, making this pragmatic.

Score: [4]

9. Primary analysis

Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;All outcome measures were analysed on the basis of intention to treat, with all variables summarized and comparisons made between groups and over time.&quot;</span>

The intention-to-treat analysis is very pragmatic.

<p><i><span style="border-bottom: 1px dashed black;">12 quote(s) from
publication full text</span> (mean similarity 97.8%)</i></p>
<pre>
Here are the PRECIS-2 domain scores and explanations for the trial described in the full text:

Eligibility criteria:

Quotes:
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Ambulatory and sedentary.&quot;</span>
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Inclusion criteria were (1) ambulatory (can walk 100 m, be capable of walking 100 metres without a walking aid corresponding to a classification of ≤5.5 on the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS), even if they do use an aid for daily activities; and (2) self-reported to be sedentary or irregularly active at time of study entry (i.e. do not exercise 30 minutes or more twice per week of moderate to vigorous activity).&quot;</span>  

Explanation: The eligibility criteria are fairly broad, including ambulatory adults with MS who are sedentary. The EDSS score limit allows inclusion of those with moderate disability. Overall, the criteria seem reasonably similar to those who would receive exercise interventions in usual care.

Score: [4]

Recruitment:

Quotes:  
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;People were recruited from four multiple sclerosis clinics in three Canadian cities and from posting on media sites.&quot;</span>

Explanation: Recruitment was done through MS clinics and media advertising. While media advertising is more active than typical recruitment for usual care, using MS clinics is a pragmatic choice. Overall, recruitment seems moderately pragmatic.

Score: [3] 

Setting:

Quotes:
<span title='Major quote deviation, possible hallucination. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 73.8%):

The intention was to follow participants for the first year of the intervention when the exercise programme was designed and adjusted as needed' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: red'>&quot;The intention was to follow participants for the first year of the intervention when the exercise programme was designed and adjusted as needed and have a further follow-up after the second year.&quot;</span>

Explanation: The setting is not explicitly described, but seems to be an outpatient setting in the community. This matches usual care for exercise interventions in MS.

Score: [4]

Organization:

Quotes:
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants in both groups received two private training sessions with the physical therapist or exercise therapist.&quot;</span>

Explanation: Participants received a small number of training sessions, which provides some initial guidance but does not substantially differ from resources available in usual care. The organization seems moderately pragmatic.

Score: [4]

Flexibility: delivery

Quotes:
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;MSTEP©, a personally adapted exercise regimen including a variety of exercises targeting endurance, muscular, and core strength, balance, flexibility, muscular power, and speed of movement.&quot;</span> 

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The goal of the MSTEP© programme is to promote regular bouts of activity most days per week, encouraging a balance between rest and activity, and taking into consideration the physical and emotional status and capacity of the person.&quot;</span>

Explanation: The MSTEP intervention allows flexibility in delivery based on the individual's needs and capacity. This matches the flexibility seen in usual care exercise programs.

Score: [5]

Flexibility: adherence

Quotes: None relevant

Explanation: The text does not mention any specific strategies to enforce adherence. It seems adherence was handled in a typical way, which would be pragmatic.

Score: [4] 

Follow-up:

Quotes:  
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Evaluators were blinded to the group that the participant was in.&quot;</span>

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The first set of analyses addressed whether the pattern of missing data was associated with the outcomes measured in this study.&quot;</span> 

Explanation: Follow-up assessments were done but the intensity is not described. The concern about missing data suggests a moderately intense follow-up. Overall, follow-up seems moderately pragmatic.

Score: [3]

Primary outcome:

Quotes:
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Primary outcome was peak oxygen consumption (VO2peak) at 12 months&quot;</span>

Explanation: VO2peak is a direct measure of exercise capacity and highly relevant to participants. This is a pragmatic choice of primary outcome.

Score: [5]

Primary analysis:

Quotes: 
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Multiple imputation was used for missing data with 11 imputations used in the analysis.&quot;</span>

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The primary analysis was of the proportion of people making an absolute improvement at the final time point, 12 months.&quot;</span>

Explanation: The analysis used multiple imputation and focused on improvement, which are pragmatic analytic approaches.

Here are the PRECIS-2 domain assessments for the given clinical trial text:

Eligibility criteria:

Relevant quotes:
<span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 98.1%):

Subjects had a definite diagnosis of primary or secondary progressive MS, and an EDSS of between 6.5 (constant bilateral assistance required to walk about 20 metres without resting) to 8 (essentially restricted to bed or chair or perambulated in wheelchair, but may be out of bed much of the day, retains many selfcare functions and generally has effective use of' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;Subjects had a definite diagnosis of primary or secondary progressive MS, and an EDSS of between 6.5 (constant bilateral assistance required to walk about 20 metres without resting) to 8 (essentially restricted to bed or chair or perambulated in wheelchair, but may be out of bed much of the day, retains many self-care functions and generally has effective use of arms).&quot;</span>

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;People with MS who were medically stable were selected where cognitive function was adequate, as assessed by a Mini Mental State Examination score of 23 or over and had at least three identifiable physiotherapy goals were included.&quot;</span> 

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Potential subjects were excluded if they had rapidly progressing disease, were already involved in a physiotherapy programme, had additional neurological conditions or other medical conditions which would preclude them taking part in the study.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The eligibility criteria are quite narrow, selecting only people with moderate to severe MS based on a specific EDSS score range. Participants had to be medically stable, have adequate cognitive function based on a specific cut-off score, and have at least 3 physiotherapy goals. People with rapidly progressing disease or other conditions were excluded. This suggests a more explanatory approach.

Score: [2]

Recruitment:

Relevant quote: 
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;People moderately to severely affected by MS were recruited from the MS Service, NHS Ayrshire and Arran.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: Participants were recruited from a single MS service. There is no mention of any additional recruitment efforts like advertising or incentives. This suggests recruitment through usual appointments, though only at a single center. 

Score: [3]

Setting:

Relevant quote:
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Setting: Community; subjects’ homes.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The intervention was delivered in the participants' homes in the community. This matches the usual care setting where home-based physiotherapy would be provided.

Score: [5] 

Organisation:

Relevant quote:  
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Subjects assigned to Group 1 received physiotherapy, twice weekly for eight weeks, by an experienced domiciliary physiotherapist within their home.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: An experienced physiotherapist provided the intervention at the patients' homes. There is no mention of extra training, resources, or expertise beyond what would be typical for home-based physiotherapy.

Score: [5]

Flexibility of delivery:

Relevant quote:
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Each session lasted up to 60 minutes, and a task-specific programme included upper and lower limb strengthening using theraband, mobile pedals, and weights. Repetition of tasks such as sit to stand, gait, balance (using gym balls and sit fits) and stretching activities were used depending on the subjects previously identified goals.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The intervention delivery involved a standardized 60 minute session focused on specific exercises and tasks based on the participant's goals. This protocol-driven approach reduces flexibility compared to usual individualized home physiotherapy.

Score: [2] 

Flexibility of adherence:

Relevant quote:
No relevant quotes.

Reasoning: There is no mention of measures to enforce or monitor adherence. As a home-based physiotherapy intervention, participants likely had flexibility similar to usual care.

Score: [5] 

Follow-up:

Relevant quotes:
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Subjects in both groups were assessed at the beginning and at the end of the eight-week intervention period (i.e. either physiotherapy or control) and then again eight weeks later.&quot;</span>

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;In total 222 of the possible 240 physiotherapy sessions were delivered. The average number of sessions received by participants was 14.8 (out of a possible 16).&quot;</span>

Reasoning: Outcomes were assessed at baseline, 8 weeks, and 16 weeks. Participants received close to the full 16 physiotherapy sessions, suggesting close follow-up. This intensity of measurement and follow-up is greater than typical usual care.

Score: [2]

Primary outcome:

Relevant quote: 
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The MS impact scale (MSIS 29), which is a measure of the physical and psychological impact of MS, was the primary outcome measure for the study.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The primary outcome was the MSIS-29 scale, which measures physical and psychological impact of MS. This patient-reported outcome is highly relevant to participants.

Score: [5]

Primary analysis:

Relevant quote:
No relevant quotes. 

Reasoning: The statistical analysis is described but there is no mention of how missing data or protocol deviations were handled.

Eligibility criteria

Quotes:
<span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 98.5%):

The only selection criterion was that the diagnosis of MS was con rmed by the general practitioner. There were no exclusion criteria.' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;The only selection criterion was that the diagnosis of MS was confirmed by the general practitioner. There were no exclusion criteria.&quot;</span>

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants were volunteers with MS who were recruited through voluntary organizations, were community based and lived in West London and in counties contiguous with Greater London.&quot;</span>

The eligibility criteria were very inclusive, with the only requirement being a confirmed MS diagnosis. Volunteers were recruited from the community rather than specialist clinics. This matches how patients would access care for MS in the real world.

Score: [5] 

Recruitment

Quote: 
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants were volunteers with MS who were recruited through voluntary organizations, were community based and lived in West London and in counties contiguous with Greater London.&quot;</span>

Participants were recruited through voluntary organizations rather than actively identified and recruited. This is very similar to how patients would access care on their own in the real world.

Score: [5]

Setting

Quote:
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;It was a community-based research study, which was approved by the appropriate local research ethics committees, and was conducted at the Centre for Research in Rehabilitation at Brunel University’s Osterley Campus in West London from June 1996 until February 1999.&quot;</span>

The study was conducted in the community rather than a specialized clinic setting. This matches the real-world setting where MS patients live and receive care.

Score: [5] 

Organization

Quote: 
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The intervention comprised discussion of self-care based on client priorities, using an information booklet about self-care.&quot;</span>

The intervention relied on existing healthcare staff and resources available in the community. No additional training, staffing, or resources were provided. This matches real-world delivery of MS care.

Score: [5]

Flexibility: Delivery

Quote:
<span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 98.4%):

As  ndings from the Delphi study highlighted the need for  exibility and responsiveness to individuals the format of the discussion focused on individuals’ interests and concerns rather than on covering all the information contained in the booklet.' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;As findings from the Delphi study highlighted the need for flexibility and responsiveness to individuals the format of the discussion focused on individuals’ interests and concerns rather than on covering all the information contained in the booklet.&quot;</span>

The self-care discussions were tailored to each participant's priorities and interests. The delivery was very flexible rather than protocol driven.

Score: [5]

Flexibility: Adherence 

No measures were described to enforce or monitor adherence. Participants likely received the usual encouragement to follow recommendations that would occur in real-world practice.

Score: [5] 

Follow-up

Quote: 
<span title='Moderate quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 85.7%):

assessments were conducted six months after baseline.' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ff9e81'>&quot;Follow-up assessments were conducted six months after baseline.&quot;</span>

A single follow-up assessment was done. No additional unscheduled visits or extensive data collection was described. This matches typical real-world follow-up.

Score: [5]

Primary Outcome

Quote:
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Total scores on a postal version of the Barthel Index, a scale measuring mobility, the SF-36, and one measure developed for the study; the Standard Day Dependency Record (SDDR), were the main outcome measures.&quot;</span>

The outcomes of mobility, quality of life, and independence are highly relevant for MS patients. They do not require special tests or adjudication.

Score: [5] 

Primary Analysis

No details were provided on the primary analysis. In the absence of information, we cannot conclude whether an intention-to-treat approach was used.

Here are the PRECIS-2 domain scores and explanations for the given clinical trial text:

1. Eligibility criteria

Quote: <span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 98.5%):

2012. Inclusion criteria were: having MS (MacDonald criteria); being able to complete a questionnaire; and being in need for a multidisciplinary approach, defined by the requirement, in addition to the neurology specialist, of at least two different medical (rehabilitation specialist, neurourology specialist, psychiatrist) or allied health professionals (physiotherapist, occupational therapist, social worker, psychologist, and neuropsychologist).

Patients who were not living independently in the community were excluded.&quot;</span>

The eligibility criteria are moderately pragmatic as patients with MS who would need a multidisciplinary approach in usual care are included. However, some patients like those not living independently who may benefit from the intervention are excluded.

Score: [3] 

2. Recruitment

Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Signed informed consent was obtained for each patient at inclusion.&quot;</span>

No details are provided on how patients were recruited, so it's unclear how pragmatic this domain is.

Score: [NA]

3. Setting

Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;This is a prospective, randomized, controlled, monocentric clinical trial in MS patients.&quot;</span>

The trial is conducted at a single center, which makes it more explanatory.

Score: [2]

4. Organization

The organization of care delivery seems very similar to usual care.

Score: [4]

5. Flexibility: Delivery

The delivery of the intervention is scheduled within a specific timeframe, indicating reduced flexibility.

Score: [2]

6. Flexibility: Adherence

No relevant quotes. The text does not provide information to assess this domain.

Score: [NA]

7. Follow-up

Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Primary and secondary outcomes were assessed at inclusion, and after six (M6) and 12 (M12) months.&quot;</span>

Follow-up is more frequent than usual care. 

Score: [2]

8. Primary Outcome  

Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The primary outcome was the impact of the strategy on quality of life (QoL) measured using the MSIS-29 scale at inclusion and after six months.&quot;</span>

The primary outcome of quality of life is highly relevant to patients.

Here are the PRECIS-2 domain scores and explanations for the trial described in the full text:

Eligibility criteria

Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;To be included in the study participants were required to have a confirmed diagnosis of MS, an Expanded Disability Status Score of between 5 and 6.5, stable drug therapy for 30 days, no relapses in the previous three months, no significant co-morbidities such as coexisting cardiac or pulmonary condition and have access to the internet via personal or tablet computer.&quot;</span>

The eligibility criteria are moderately pragmatic as they include typical MS patients who would receive this intervention in usual care. However, they exclude some patients like those with comorbidities.

Score: [3] 

Recruitment

Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Letters were sent to 138 patients from the Multiple Sclerosis Service database, thought to be suitable for the study, inviting them to participate.&quot;</span>

The recruitment method of sending invitation letters to potentially eligible patients is moderately pragmatic as some extra effort beyond usual care was made to recruit participants. 

Score: [3]

Setting

Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants were recruited from the Multiple Sclerosis Service, at the Douglas Grant Rehabilitation Centre, Irvine, Scotland.&quot;</span>

Conducting the trial at a single rehabilitation center is moderately explanatory compared to a more pragmatic multicenter trial across different settings.

Score: [2]

Organisation

Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Individualised therapeutic exercise programmes were developed for participants in Group 1, with exercises selected based on their baseline assessment and personal goals.&quot;</span>

The intervention delivery seems similar to usual care without requiring extra resources or expertise. This is a pragmatic approach.

Score: [4]

Flexibility: Delivery

Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Individualised exercise programmes were developed for participants in Group 1, with exercises selected based on their baseline assessment and personal goals.&quot;</span>

Allowing flexibility in how the intervention is delivered based on participant goals and assessments is a pragmatic approach.

Score: [4]

Flexibility: Adherence 

No measures to enforce adherence are mentioned. Participants were just encouraged to do the exercises. This pragmatic approach mirrors usual care.

Score: [4] 

Follow-up

Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Outcome measures were recorded at baseline and at the end of the intervention period (week 13).&quot;</span>

Follow-up at two time points is moderately pragmatic and similar to usual care. More frequent follow-ups would be more explanatory.

Score: [3]

Primary outcome  

Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The primary outcome measure, the timed 25 foot walk, has good reliability and validity in the MS population.&quot;</span> 

The 25 foot walk is a relevant functional outcome for MS patients. This is a pragmatic choice.

Primary analysis

Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Data from the 25ft walk was used to calculate the sample size required for a fully powered, randomized controlled trial.&quot;</span>

No details are provided but intention-to-treat analysis is typical for pragmatic trials. I will assume that was done.

<p><i><span style="border-bottom: 1px dashed black;">8 quote(s) from
publication full text</span> (mean similarity 98.6%)</i></p>
<pre>
Here are the PRECIS-2 domain scores and explanations for the given paper:

1. Eligibility criteria

Quote: <span title='Moderate quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 88.5%):

To be eligible, all patients screened for study participation had to be affected by clinically definite multiple sclerosis 17 and live in the' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ff9e81'>&quot;To be eligible, all patients screened for study participation had to be affected by clinically definite multiple sclerosis and live in the Rome service area.&quot;</span>

Score: [2] Rather explanatory

This study had strict inclusion criteria requiring patients to have clinically definite MS based on specific diagnostic criteria. The patients also had to live in a certain geographic area. This limits the trial to a narrower population than would be seen in usual care.

2. Recruitment

Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Patients were recruited from the multiple sclerosis centre of the neurological department of La Sapienza University, or from other institutional centres for multiple sclerosis in Rome.&quot;</span>

Score: [2] Rather explanatory  

Patients were recruited from specialty MS centers rather than from the settings where they would normally receive care. This makes the recruitment more explanatory.

3. Setting

Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The study was conducted in Rome and was approved by the ethics committee of La Sapienza University.&quot;</span>

Score: [2] Rather explanatory

The study was conducted at a single university site. This specialized setting is likely different from the usual care setting for most patients.

4. Organization

Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Based on individual needs, patients randomised to home based care were followed through home visits and telephone follow up. A dedicated phone number was available five days a week from 9 am to 5 pm, where an operator addressed questions or concerns from patients and caregivers and contacted the different specialists according to the specific requirement.&quot;</span>

Score: [4] Rather pragmatic

The home-based intervention used existing healthcare staff and resources that would be available in the community. The organization seems similar to usual care.

5. Flexibility: delivery

Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The home based care multidisciplinary team included two neurologists, a urologist, a rehabilitation physician, a psychologist, a physical therapist, a nurse, a social worker, and a coordinator. These were provided with cell phones and could easily be reached for advice (telephone intervention) or direct face to face intervention when required.&quot;</span>

Score: [3] Equally pragmatic and explanatory

The home-based care allowed for some flexibility in delivery through different types of providers and modalities. However, it was still a protocol-driven intervention.

6. Flexibility: adherence

Score: [NA] 

No relevant quotes found. The paper does not mention any strategies to enforce or monitor adherence.

7. Follow-up

Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;At the end of a one year follow up period, all patients underwent the same comprehensive interview as at baseline.&quot;</span> 

Score: [3] Equally pragmatic and explanatory

Patients were followed for 1 year, which is longer than usual care. However, the intensity and frequency of measurement does not seem much different than usual care.

8. Primary outcome  

Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Functional outcomes were calculated as the mean change of scores from baseline to the final follow up at 12 months.&quot;</span>

Score: [4] Rather pragmatic

The primary outcomes of functional status and quality of life are patient-centered and relevant for policy and practice decisions.

9. Primary analysis

Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;For each scale of the SF-36 and separately for the case and control group, we adopted a regression model in which score changes at the end of the follow up period were adjusted for the baseline values.&quot;</span>

Score: [5] Very pragmatic

The analysis seems to include all randomized patients using an intention-to-treat approach.</pre>

Relevant quotes: 
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Potential participants known to Multiple Sclerosis healthcare practitioners working across seven outpatient centres in Scotland – Ayrshire & Arran, Greater Glasgow & Clyde, Dumfries and Galloway, Lanarkshire, Lothian, Fife and Tayside – were informed of the study and issued with a participant information sheet.&quot;</span>
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants required to have a clinical diagnosis of Multiple Sclerosis, persistent foot drop (lasting a minimum of three months) observed during a 5-minute walk test, stable disease (no change in the Extended Disability Status Score12 or relapse in previous three months), 5° of passive dorsiflexion and tolerance of functional electrical stimulation.&quot;</span>

The eligibility criteria are moderately pragmatic. Participants were recruited from multiple centers across Scotland, suggesting a reasonably diverse real-world population. However, there were some exclusions like prior experience with devices and contraindications to FES, which limit generalizability. Overall, the criteria strike a balance between being selective yet inclusive of the target population.

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Potential participants known to Multiple Sclerosis healthcare practitioners working across seven outpatient centres in Scotland – Ayrshire & Arran, Greater Glasgow & Clyde, Dumfries and Galloway, Lanarkshire, Lothian, Fife and Tayside – were informed of the study and issued with a participant information sheet. Potential participants contacted the researchers if they were interested in participating.&quot;</span>

The recruitment process seems fairly pragmatic. Participants were recruited through multiple MS clinics, leveraging routine care settings. They had to contact researchers themselves if interested, with no overt recruitment efforts mentioned. This passive approach aligns with how patients would access treatment in usual care.

The setting is pragmatic. Recruitment spanned seven MS clinics across different regions of Scotland. This diversity of sites should make the results generalizable to real-world MS populations and care settings. No mention of limiting to specialized centers.

Relevant quotes:
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants randomized to the usual care group were fitted with a custom-made, solid, ankle-foot orthosis by an orthotist, within four weeks of their initial assessment.&quot;</span> 
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants randomized to the functional electrical stimulation group were assessed and fitted with an Odstock Dropped Foot Stimulator Pace (OML, Salisbury) device by a physiotherapist experienced in functional electrical stimulation (A.L.).&quot;</span>

The organization is moderately pragmatic. Routine staff (orthotists, physiotherapists) delivered the interventions, reflecting real-world expertise. Custom orthoses were provided, which may exceed typical resources but are still standard care. Overall, resources were not substantially enhanced beyond usual care.

Flexibility: Delivery <span style='background-color: #ff9e81' title='Added score prefix during extraction'>Score: [4]</span>  
Relevant quotes:
No quotes specifically about flexibility in delivery, but the protocol does not seem to dictate the interventions in a strict, protocolized manner.

The delivery seems reasonably flexible based on the lack of information specifying fixed protocols. The orthotists and physiotherapists were able to deliver the orthoses and FES as deemed clinically appropriate. This aligns with flexible delivery in usual practice.

Flexibility: Adherence <span style='background-color: #ff9e81' title='Added score prefix during extraction'>Score: [4]</span>
Relevant quotes: 
No quotes related to adherence.

Adherence flexibility is likely pragmatic since there is no mention of special efforts to enforce or monitor adherence. The lack of information suggests participants' adherence was not tightly controlled beyond standard encouragement.

Follow-up <span style='background-color: #ff9e81' title='Added score prefix during extraction'>Score: [2]</span>
Relevant quotes:
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Outcome measures were administered by two unblinded assessors (Rebecca Hunter and A.L.) at baseline (0), 3, 6 and 12 months&quot;</span>

The follow-up is somewhat explanatory. Participants were assessed at four fixed time points over 12 months, which is more frequent contact than usual care. The intensity of measurement is greater than typical follow-up.

Primary outcome <span style='background-color: #ff9e81' title='Added score prefix during extraction'>Score: [4]</span>  
Relevant quotes:  
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The primary outcome was walking speed as measured by the 5-minute self-selected walk test. Participants walked twice, once with their device and once without, resting for 20 minutes between. The total distance walked was recorded and the mean walking speed (m/s) calculated.&quot;</span>

The primary outcome is pragmatic. Walking speed is highly relevant to MS patients and directly informs the impact of the interventions on real-world function. It was measured in a straightforward, clinically applicable manner.

Primary analysis <span style='background-color: #ff9e81' title='Added score prefix during extraction'>Score: [5]</span>
Relevant quotes:
No quotes about the primary analysis methodology.

The analysis seems very pragmatic based on the lack of information about exclusions or protocol deviations. An intention-to-treat approach was likely used including all randomized participants.

publication full text</span> (mean similarity 100%)</i></p>
<pre>
Here are the PRECIS-2 domain scores and explanations for the clinical trial described in the full text:

1. Eligibility criteria

Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants were non-institutionalized adults (age ≥ 18 years) with severe MS and their primary carers. Other patient inclusion criteria were primary or secondary progressive MS, Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score ≥ 8.0, complex symptoms, and ≥2 unmet care needs.&quot;</span>

Score: [3] The eligibility criteria include adults with severe progressive MS based on EDSS score and symptoms. This excludes milder MS cases but does not seem overly selective beyond patients who would receive palliative care. The inclusion of primary carers makes it more pragmatic.

2. Recruitment 

Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Dyads were randomly assigned (2:1) to receive HPA or UC.&quot;</span> 

Score: [4] Participants seem to be recruited from MS clinics at the study centers. No special efforts beyond care settings are mentioned.

3. Setting

Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;In this randomized, examiner-blind, controlled study, we recruited patients from three Italian centers.&quot;</span>

Score: [4] The setting is multiple hospitals/clinics where patients receive MS care. This matches usual care.

4. Organization

Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Based on the principles of PC, each center had a HPA team consisting of a physician (neurologist or physiatrist), a nurse (case manager and team leader), a psychologist, and a social worker.&quot;</span>

Score: [3] The HPA intervention requires some additional staffing and expertise beyond typical care. But this is not excessive.

5. Flexibility: delivery

Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;After a comprehensive assessment of the dyad needs based on direct observation and on visit 1 information, the HPA team defined the contents of the intervention, involving the dyad and the patient caring physician.&quot;</span>

Score: [4] The HPA intervention seems moderately flexible in how it is delivered to meet patient needs.

6. Flexibility: adherence

No relevant quotes.

Score: [NA] Adherence does not seem applicable as this is not a drug trial with dosing.

7. Follow-up

Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The blind examiners used a web-based case report form (eCRF), so that visit 1–3 data were available to HPA teams and coordination unit.&quot;</span>

Score: [2] Follow-up includes 3 study visits and monthly phone calls, which is more intensive than usual care.

8. Primary outcome

Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Mean change in POS-S-MS score from baseline to 3 months was 1.1 (95% confidence interval (CI), −0.5 to 2.7) in the HPA group and −0.2 (95% CI, −2.9 to 2.6) in the UC group, with a mean between-group difference of 1.3 (95% CI, −1.7 to 4.2)&quot;</span>

Score: [4] The primary outcome of symptom burden assessed by POS-S-MS seems very relevant to patients.

9. Primary analysis

Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;All randomly assigned patients were included in the main intention-to-treat analysis, provided that at least one contact with the team occurred (HPA group).&quot;</span>

Score: [5] The analysis is intention-to-treat, which is pragmatic.</pre>

Here are the PRECIS-2 domain assessments for the trial:

Eligibility criteria:

Relevant quotes:
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The main inclusion criteria were: (1) clinically definite MS diagnosis, (2) fatigue impacting on daily life (Fatigue Severity Scale total score >4) and (3) ambulatory.&quot;</span>

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The main exclusion criteria were: (1) having taken part in a fatigue programme in the last year, (2) cognitive impairments, (3) a relapse in the previous 3 months or (4) having started treatment with disease modifying or antidepressant drugs within the previous 3 months.&quot;</span>

The eligibility criteria are moderately pragmatic - patients had to have a definite MS diagnosis and significant fatigue, which matches the intended intervention population. However, some patients were excluded such as those with cognitive impairment or recent relapse/treatment changes, which reduces generalizability.

Score: [3]

Recruitment:

Relevant quotes: 
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants were recruited in three UK centres (Poole, Bristol, Southampton/Portsmouth) from primary or secondary care, or via MS Society newsletters/websites.&quot;</span>

The recruitment methods used multiple strategies including routine clinic visits as well as newsletters and websites. This mix of recruitment methods is moderately pragmatic. Routine clinic recruitment alone would be more pragmatic.

Score: [3] 

Setting:

Relevant quotes:
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants were recruited in three UK centres (Poole, Bristol, Southampton/Portsmouth) from primary or secondary care, or via MS Society newsletters/websites.&quot;</span>

The trial was conducted across multiple centers in both primary and secondary care settings. This diversity of settings matches routine practice and is pragmatic.

Score: [4]

Organisation:

Relevant quote: 
<span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 97.4%):

The intervention consists of six sessions (∼90 min duration) held weekly and facilitated in groups of 6–12 by two health professionals with experience of working with people with MS and group-work (such as occupational therapists, nurses or physiotherapists).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;The FACETS intervention consists of six sessions (∼90 min duration) held weekly and facilitated in groups of 6–12 by two health professionals with experience of working with people with MS and group-work (such as occupational therapists, nurses or physiotherapists).&quot;</span>

The intervention was delivered by existing healthcare staff with experience in MS care. No additional resources or training were mentioned. This matches routine practice and is pragmatic.

Score: [4]

Flexibility: delivery

Relevant quote:
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The facilitator manual provides guidance on preparation and delivery, detailed session content, notes and suggested timings, and a checklist of facilitator objectives as well as signposts to additional resources. Sessions are delivered via PowerPoint; hence can be easily replicated.&quot;</span> 

The intervention delivery was protocolized with manuals, suggested scripts, and powerpoint slides. This reduces flexibility compared to routine practice and is more explanatory.

Score: [2]

Flexibility: adherence

No relevant quotes. The paper does not mention any strategies to enforce or monitor adherence. This suggests a pragmatic approach.

Score: [4] 

Follow-up:

Relevant quote:  
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants assigned to the CLP arm completed all outcome measures within an identical time frame to those in the FACETS arm (see published protocol and results tables).&quot;</span>

The follow-up schedule was the same in both arms, suggesting it matches routine practice. This is pragmatic.

Score: [4]

Primary outcome:

Relevant quote:
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;These were: (1) fatigue severity (Global Fatigue Severity (GFS) subscale of the Fatigue Assessment Instrument (FAI)), (2) disease-specific quality of life (QOL) (total score on the Multiple Sclerosis Impact Scale, V.1 (MSIS-29, V.1)) and (3) self-efficacy for managing fatigue (Multiple Sclerosis-Fatigue Self-Efficacy scale—adapted from the Control subscale of the MS Self-Efficacy scale).&quot;</span>

The primary outcomes of fatigue severity, quality of life, and self-efficacy are patient-centered and important to participants. This is pragmatic.

Score: [4]

Primary analysis:

No relevant quotes. The paper does not provide details on the primary analysis methods.

Here are the PRECIS-2 domain scores and explanations for the given clinical trial text:

Eligibility criteria

Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Inclusion criteria for the study included (1) a diagnosis of MS, (2) not currently engaged in rehabilitation, therapy or PA program and able to undertake PA without risk-factors (3) aged between 18 and 65 (4) able to give informed consent and to understand French.&quot;</span>

The eligibility criteria are reasonably broad, including adults aged 18-65 with a diagnosis of MS who are able to provide consent and undertake physical activity. Some patients are excluded such as those currently in rehabilitation programs, but overall the criteria seem intended to recruit a sample similar to the general MS population.

Score: [4] Rather pragmatic

Recruitment

Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Individuals were approached by the study coordinator and asked if they would be willing to participate in it.&quot;</span> 

Participants were recruited directly by the study coordinator when they presented for outpatient care. No special efforts like media campaigns or incentives were used. This matches usual care recruitment.

Score: [5] Very pragmatic  

Setting

Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;This clinical and multicentric trial took place from July 2017 to January 2020, in two hospitals in the Parisian Region, France (Hospitals – CHI Poissy St Germain-en-Laye and R.

1. Eligibility criteria 

Quotes:
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;MS patients older than 18 years who had a confirmed MS with spasticity of the lower limbs and an Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score between 4 and 6.5 were eligible for inclusion.&quot;</span>

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Patients who had received hippotherapy within the last 12 months, a body weight over 90 kg, no balance while sitting, and acute exacerbation during the 4-week period before start of the therapy were excluded.&quot;</span> 

Explanation: The eligibility criteria are moderately pragmatic. Patients of all adult ages with confirmed MS diagnosis and some degree of disability are included, reflecting a typical MS population that would receive this intervention in usual care. However, patients with very severe or very mild disability are excluded, as are those with recent exacerbations or hippotherapy. <span style='background-color: #ffe9e2' title='Moved squared brackets during extraction'>Score: [3]</span>

2. Recruitment

Quote: 
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Eligible patients were randomized to one of the two groups using sealed opaque envelopes on the basis of a computer-generated randomization list.&quot;</span>

Explanation: The text does not provide details on how patients were identified or recruited, beyond stating they were randomized after being confirmed eligible. The recruitment process is unclear. <span style='background-color: #ffe9e2' title='Moved squared brackets during extraction'>Score: [NA]</span> 

3. Setting

Quote:
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The study was conducted at five sites in Germany, all of which have hippotherapy experience as stipulated by the rules of the German Consortium for Therapeutic Riding.&quot;</span>

Explanation: The trial took place at multiple specialized hippotherapy centers in Germany.

Here are the domain assessments for the given clinical trial text:

Eligibility criteria:

Relevant quotes:
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants eligible for inclusion were adults aged over 15 years with one of the following possible recorded diagnoses: MS, PD and other causes of progressive parkinsonism, motor neurone disease, Huntington's disease and other degenerative disorders affecting the central nervous system, muscles or peripheral nerves.&quot;</span>

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;In order to preserve a focus on primarily physical disabilities, dementing disorders such as Alzheimer's disease were not included.&quot;</span> 

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants whose clinical features appeared incompatible with the recorded diagnosis were excluded, as were those with neurological complications of primarily non-neurological conditions such as diabetes mellitus, or additional causes of severe disability.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The eligibility criteria are moderately broad, including adults over 15 years old with a range of progressive neurological conditions causing physical disability. However, they exclude conditions like Alzheimer's disease and diabetes complications in order to focus on physical rather than cognitive disabilities. Overall, the criteria seem to target a specific patient population that is narrower than would be seen in routine practice.

Score: [3]

Recruitment:

Relevant quotes:  
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;From July 1998 we approached the 177 GPs based within the City of Nottingham boundaries (population 282000). Participants eligible for inclusion were adults aged over 15 years with one of the following possible recorded diagnoses: MS, PD and other causes of progressive parkinsonism, motor neurone disease, Huntington's disease and other degenerative disorders affecting the central nervous system, muscles or peripheral nerves.&quot;</span>

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;To avoid ascertainment bias towards people already receiving specific health or social services, we used GP information as the sole method for identifying potential participants.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: Participants were identified via their GP records, avoiding ascertainment bias towards those already receiving services. This matches routine practice for identifying patients with these conditions. However, extensive inquiries were made to GPs to find eligible patients, going beyond routine practice.

Score: [4] 

Setting:

Relevant quotes:  
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The study took place between August 1997 and March 2000 and was approved by the research ethics committee of Queen's Medical Centre (Nottingham, UK). Each participant gave written informed consent.&quot;</span>

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants' homes in the City of Nottingham.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial was conducted in participants' homes in the community setting of Nottingham, which matches the routine care setting for this patient population.

Score: [5]

Organization:

Relevant quotes:  
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;In the education group (EG), baseline data were reviewed by an expert panel which advised on actions most likely to promote each individual's physical, social and psychological well-being.&quot;</span>

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;An occupational therapist (OT) then visited EG participants to provide education and information and to discuss a personalized 12-month health action plan.&quot;</span> 

Reasoning: An expert panel reviewed baseline data to advise on actions for each participant, and an OT visited to provide personalized education. This requires more resources and expertise than routine care.

Score: [2]

Flexibility of experimental intervention - Delivery:

Relevant quote: 
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;An occupational therapist (OT) then visited EG participants to provide education and information and to discuss a personalized 12-month health action plan.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The education intervention was personalized for each participant based on expert panel input. But the delivery method of an OT visit seems moderately flexible.

Score: [3]

Flexibility of experimental intervention - Adherence:

Relevant quote:
No relevant quotes found.

Reasoning: The text does not mention any measures to enforce or monitor adherence. 

Score: [NA]

Follow-up:

Relevant quotes:
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Information on adverse events was collected by phone at two-monthly intervals between baseline and 12-month assessments, when a general enquiry was made without specific reference to falls or sores.&quot;</span>

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;To measure well-being, we used the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-28) in participants and main carers (for both scores higher values signify decline in function).&quot;</span> 

Reasoning: Follow-up was done via phone calls every 2 months over 12 months to collect adverse event data, more frequent than routine practice. Additional questionnaires were used to assess outcomes.

Score: [2] 

Primary outcome:

Relevant quotes:
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Primary outcome measures were reports of one or more falls or skin sores. At interview, participants were asked 'In the past 12 months, have you fallen? Have you had a skin sore?'&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The primary outcomes of falls and skin sores are directly relevant adverse events for patients. But they rely on patient self-report rather than documentation in routine records.

Score: [4]

Primary analysis:

Relevant quote: 
No relevant quotes found.

Reasoning: The text does not provide information about the primary analysis method.

Eligibility criteria

Quotes:
<span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Inclusion criteria—Patients with confirmed diagnosis: ≥16 years of age with unilateral facial nerve weakness of no identifiable cause who presented to primary care or an emergency department and could be referred to a collaborating otorhinolaryngologist <72 hours after the onset of symptoms.&quot;</span>

<span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Exclusion criteria—Pregnancy, breast feeding, uncontrolled diabetes, peptic ulcer disease, suppurative otitis media, herpes zoster, multiple sclerosis, systematic infection, sarcoidosis and other rare conditions, and an inability to provide informed consent.&quot;</span> 

<span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Extra test—Randomised controlled trial of Bell’s palsy treatment required senior otorhinolaryngologist in hospitals to confirm a patient’s eligibility to participate. Bell’s palsy is usually diagnosed by a general practitioner in primary care.&quot;</span>

Explanation: The trial has strict inclusion/exclusion criteria and requires an extra test by a specialist not routinely done in usual care. This makes the eligibility criteria more explanatory.

Follow-up:

Quotes: 
<span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Clinical follow-up until patient left hospital (discharge or death) or until 30 days after surgery, whichever was the longer, so more than usual care.&quot;</span>

"Monitoring intensity involved more extensive data collection than usual:
Pre-operation—three-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) Holter monitor (Flashcard with 2×48 hour recording) set up on each patient and maintained for 72 hours.
Troponin values at 1, 3, and 7 days after surgery (more usual for only 1 and 3 days after surgery)
ECG after randomisation and at 7 and 30 days after surgery."

Explanation: The trial had more frequent and longer follow-up than usual care, with additional data collection. This makes follow-up more explanatory.

Score: [2]

Primary outcome:

Quotes:  
<span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Primary outcome—Recovery of facial function as rated on the House-Brackmann scale.&quot;</span> 

<span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Test not routinely used in primary care and requires training. It is, however, an easy clinical test widely used in secondary care for grading recovery from facial nerve paralysis caused by damage to lower motor neurons.&quot;</span>

<span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Central adjudication—Photographs taken of patients were assessed and graded independently by a panel of three experts (not general practitioners, who usually assess).&quot;</span>

Explanation: The primary outcome requires specialized training and central adjudication not routine in usual care. This makes the primary outcome more explanatory.

Score: [2]

Eligibility criteria:

Quotes:
<span title='Major quote deviation, possible hallucination. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 74%):

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Eligible participants were excluded from the study if they were already engaged in a formal exercise program lasting >30 minutes twice per week, experienced an exacerbation within the past 4 weeks, had their MS immunomodulation medications altered in the previous 4 weeks or during the trial period, or declined to be randomly allocated.&quot;</span>

Explanation: The eligibility criteria are moderately pragmatic as they include MS patients who would be typical candidates for the intervention in usual care, such as those able to walk 10 meters aided or unaided. However, some exclusions like those already engaged in formal exercise make it less pragmatic.

Score: [3]

Recruitment:

Quote: 
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Community dwelling people with MS were recruited through the Multiple Sclerosis Society of New South Wales and South Australia.&quot;</span>

Explanation: Recruitment was done through an MS society rather than recruitment during usual clinic visits, which makes it moderately pragmatic but not completely identical to usual care.

Score: [3]  

Setting:

Quote:
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The group program was conducted at a local community center and included four to six participants per class.&quot;</span>

Explanation: The setting of a local community center is very similar to usual care for an exercise intervention and hence pragmatic. 

Score: [4]

Organization:

Quote:  
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Groups were led by a physiotherapist employed by the Multiple Sclerosis Society who received training to ensure a standard approach to intervention, intensity, and progression.&quot;</span>

Explanation: The physiotherapists had usual expertise and resources like in standard care, making the organization pragmatic.

Score: [4]

Flexibility (delivery):

Quote: 
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Guidelines were provided to physiotherapists and participants for exercises to be adapted and progressed to suit individual functional ability via increasing repetitions, amplitude of movement, speed of movement, and modifying base of support.&quot;</span>

Explanation: The delivery allowed flexibility for physiotherapists to adapt the exercises like in usual practice, which is very pragmatic.

Score: [5] 

Flexibility (adherence):

Quote:
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Home exercise participants were provided with one center-based physiotherapist-led session at the commencement of the intervention period for training, and telephone support by a physiotherapist to discuss their program every 2 weeks.&quot;</span>

Explanation: There was usual encouragement for adherence through training and phone support, making it very pragmatic. 

Score: [5]

Follow-up:

Quote: 
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants attended a local community center to complete all assessments at pre-intervention (week 0), post-intervention (week 8), and at follow-up (week 16).&quot;</span>

Explanation: Follow-up assessments were done at baseline, post-intervention and 8 weeks after, which is not much different from usual care.

Score: [4]

Primary outcome:

Quote:  
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The primary outcome measure was gait speed, measured using the 10-meter walk test.&quot;</span>

Explanation: The 10-meter walk test is a very relevant outcome measure for MS patients in usual practice.

Score: [5] 

Primary analysis:

Quote:
<span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 96.9%):

Data were analyzed according to the intention-totreat principle' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;Data were analyzed according to the intention-to-treat principle.&quot;</span>

<pre>
Here are the PRECIS-2 domain scores and explanations:

Eligibility criteria 
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;We included expectant mothers of different ages and states from the 37th week in where child birth was expected any time (induced or conduced) having: dilations at ≥ 4 cm, two or more contractions in 10 minutes, skin covering the whole of the SP6 bilateral point and with a live fetus with a cephalic vertex and in good condition.&quot;</span>

Score: [4] Rather pragmatic

The eligibility criteria seem reasonably broad, including expectant mothers from 37 weeks gestation onward with cervical dilation ≥4 cm and at least 2 contractions per 10 minutes. No mention of excluding based on predicted adherence. Overall quite pragmatic.

Recruitment
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The pregnant women in labor were allocated through a sequential list of random numbers in blocks of six patients generated using the program Excel® and they were distributed in three groups&quot;</span> 

Score: [4] Rather pragmatic  

Participants were recruited as they presented for labor at the hospital. No special efforts described to recruit beyond normal clinic flow. Fairly pragmatic recruitment.

Setting
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;It was carried out between January and August of 2013. The subjects were pregnant women admitted to a teaching tertiary public hospital on the outskirts of the state of Sao Paulo, Brazil.&quot;</span>

Score: [3] Equally pragmatic and explanatory

Single public hospital setting, unclear if specialized or typical care setting for this population. Not enough information to judge pragmatism.

Organization
Quote: No relevant quotes

Score: [NA] Not enough information 

No information provided on resources, expertise, care organization versus usual care.

Flexibility: Delivery
Quote: No relevant quotes

Score: [NA] Not enough information

No information provided on flexibility in delivering the intervention versus usual care.

Flexibility: Adherence 
Quote: No relevant quotes

Score: [NA] Not enough information

No information provided on measures to enforce adherence.

Follow-up
Quote: <span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 99.3%):

VAS was used to evaluate the pain and for predeveloped questions. The women were able to classify their perception of the pain (Table 3).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;VAS was used to evaluate the pain and for pre-developed questions. The women were able to classify their perception of the pain (Table 3).&quot;</span>

Score: [4] Rather pragmatic

Follow-up with VAS pain scale seems reasonably similar to typical follow-up in usual care.

Primary Outcome  
Quote: <span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 99.3%):

VAS was used to evaluate the pain and for predeveloped questions. The women were able to classify their perception of the pain (Table 3).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;VAS was used to evaluate the pain and for pre-developed questions. The women were able to classify their perception of the pain (Table 3).&quot;</span>

Score: [5] Very pragmatic

VAS pain scale is simple, patient-centered and likely similar to assessment in usual practice.

Here are the PRECIS-2 domain scores and explanations for the given clinical trial:

1. Eligibility criteria 

Relevant quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Inclusion criteria were patients aged 45-65 with mild and moderate COPD (grade II and III) as the primary disease.&quot;</span>
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Excluded were individuals who had another major disease&quot;</span> [...] <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;, who were non-Icelandic speaking, not capable of travelling to the treatment site and those who had participated in a structured rehabilitation programme for people with COPD 6 months prior to the screening.&quot;</span>

The inclusion criteria focused on patients with mild to moderate COPD as the primary disease, which matches the target population for the intervention. The exclusions were reasonable and did not overly restrict the participants compared to real-world practice.

Score: [4] Rather pragmatic

2. Recruitment

Relevant quote: 
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Patients were recruited from each of the primary health care centres and lung physicians’ offices.&quot;</span>

Patients were recruited through their regular health care providers, which matches real-world practice. No additional recruitment efforts were mentioned. 

Score: [5] Very pragmatic  

3. Setting

Relevant quote:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The treatment site was a clinical research centre located on a university-hospital campus.&quot;</span>

The treatment was delivered at a research center rather than the patients' usual care settings. This reduces pragmatism.

Score: [2] Rather explanatory

4. Organization

Relevant quote: 
- No details provided on expertise/resources required to deliver the intervention.

Insufficient information to assess organization.

Score: [NA] 

5. Flexibility: Delivery

Relevant quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The main approach is to work with patients and families to find out what is meaningful for them in life as regards health and jointly decide on that which is possible and relevant for each patient and family.&quot;</span>
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Knowledge from relevant literature, e.g. the GOLD clinical guidelines was incorporated into the non-judgmental dialogue which is central in the partnership.&quot;</span>

The delivery allowed flexibility and incorporated patient priorities, with guidance from best practice guidelines. This matches real-world practice.

Score: [5] Very pragmatic

6. Flexibility: Adherence

Relevant quote: 
- No details provided on measures to enforce adherence.

Insufficient information to assess flexibility of adherence. 

Score: [NA]

7. Follow-up

Relevant quote:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Data were collected at baseline and at month 12. Additionally, data collection was carried out in the experimental group at month 6 after the last treatment session.&quot;</span>

Follow-up data collection was limited to baseline, 6 months, and 12 months. This matches typical real-world follow-up.

Score: [4] Rather pragmatic

8. Primary outcome  

Relevant quote: 
- Primary outcomes included HRQL, illness intrusiveness, anxiety, depression, physical activity, exacerbations, and smoking status.

The outcomes are clinically meaningful for patients.

Score: [5] Very pragmatic

9. Primary analysis

Relevant quote:
- No details provided on primary analysis methods.

Insufficient information to assess analysis.

Eligibility criteria 
Quote: <span title='Major quote deviation, possible hallucination. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 63.8%):

The eligibility criteria are quite broad, including adults with asthma who are due for their routine review. The criteria rely on data readily available in the GP practices to identify eligible patients. Overall, the eligibility seems to target a patient population that is very similar to real world asthma patients receiving routine reviews.

Score: [4] Rather pragmatic

Recruitment  
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;We wrote to all eligible patients inviting them to take part in the study.&quot;</span>

Patients were recruited by mailing invitation letters to eligible patients identified from the GP practice records. This seems like a fairly pragmatic form of recruitment that could be implemented in real world settings, without extensive advertising or incentives.

Score: [4] Rather pragmatic


Setting
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;All four general practices that took part in the study had nurses who were trained and experienced in providing proactive asthma care&quot;</span>

The trial was conducted in multiple general practices with nurses experienced in asthma care. This matches the real world setting where asthma reviews take place in general practices.

Score: [5] Very pragmatic

Organisation
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Nurses were given no instructions about the content of the review except that it should reflect their normal practice and be appropriate to each patient’s clinical need.&quot;</span>

The nurses delivered the intervention as part of their normal workload and practice. No additional training, staffing or resources were provided. This matches real world delivery of asthma reviews.

Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Follow up questionnaires on morbidity and satisfaction with the consultation were sent to the patients at three months.&quot;</span>

Aside from a single follow-up at 3 months for outcomes assessment, there was no extra follow-up beyond what would occur in usual care.

Score: [4] Rather pragmatic

Primary outcome  
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Primary outcome measures were the proportion of participants who were reviewed within three months of randomisation and disease specific quality of life, as measured by the Juniper mini asthma quality of life questionnaire.&quot;</span>

The primary outcomes of review rate and quality of life are highly relevant for asthma patients in real world practice.

Score: [5] Very pragmatic

<p><i><span style="border-bottom: 1px dashed black;">8 quote(s) from
publication full text</span> (mean similarity 99.7%)</i></p>
<pre>
Here are the PRECIS-2 domain scores and explanations for the given full text:

Eligibility criteria 
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The inclusion criteria were: a positive diagnosis of RA (1987 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria), age 18 years or older and the ability to complete questionnaires unaided.&quot;</span>

Score: [4] Rather pragmatic

The eligibility criteria are fairly broad, including adults with confirmed RA diagnosis based on standard criteria who are able to complete questionnaires. No exclusions based on disease severity or adherence. The criteria seem to match reasonably closely to patients who would receive this intervention in usual care.

Recruitment  
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;After gaining patient consent, demographics and disease activity score in 28 joints (DAS28), patients were randomly assigned using a remote secure telephone randomisation service provided by Leeds University Clinical Trials Research Unit.&quot;</span>

Score: [5] Very pragmatic  

Patients were recruited during their regular clinic visits, no special efforts were made to identify or recruit patients. This matches how patients would access this intervention in usual care.

Setting
Quote: <span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 97.7%):

The study was conducted in outpatient clinics of 10 rheumatology centres across the UK.' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;This study was conducted in outpatient clinics of 10 rheumatology centres across the UK.&quot;</span> 

Score: [5] Very pragmatic

The trial was conducted in the same setting (outpatient rheumatology clinics) as usual care for RA patients. Using multiple centers also increases generalizability.

Organisation
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The CNS had a median experience of 10 years in their current post while the rheumatologists had a median of 9 years at consultant level.&quot;</span>

Score: [4] Rather pragmatic 

The CNS and rheumatologists had typical experience levels, no additional training or resources were provided. The care delivery seems largely similar to usual care.

Flexibility: delivery
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The NLC interventions usually include allocated 30-min time slots in which the CNS takes history, performs physical examination, pain control, prescribing or recommending medication and dosage changes, intra-articular or intramuscular steroid injections, provision of patient education, psychosocial support and ordering blood tests or X-rays.&quot;</span>

Score: [4] Rather pragmatic

The nurse-led intervention is described in reasonable detail but does not seem overly prescriptive. Nurses were allowed flexibility in delivery while working within their scope of practice.

Flexibility: adherence
Quote: No relevant information provided.

Score: [NA]

Follow-up
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Independent assessors were health professionals trained to perform joint counts and calculating the DAS28.&quot;</span> 

Score: [3] Equally pragmatic and explanatory

Patients were followed up more frequently than usual care to assess outcomes. However, follow-up visits were limited to joint counts and questionnaires, without extensive additional data collection.

Primary outcome
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The primary outcome was DAS28 and secondary outcomes were pain severity (pain-VAS), fatigue (fatigue-VAS) and duration of morning stiffness measured at each study visit.&quot;</span>

Score: [4] Rather pragmatic

DAS28 is a standard composite measure of RA disease activity used in clinical practice. The other outcomes are also clinically relevant for patients.

Primary analysis
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Analysis followed per-protocol (PP) and intention-to-treat (ITT) approaches.&quot;</span>

Score: [5] Very pragmatic

The analysis was by intention-to-treat, consistent with a pragmatic approach.

In summary, most domains were scored as rather pragmatic or very pragmatic, with reasonably broad eligibility criteria, recruitment through usual clinics, multicenter design, delivery flexibility, and clinically meaningful outcomes. The trial design seems well matched to the intended purpose of evaluating nurse-led care in real-world settings.</pre>

<p><i><span style="border-bottom: 1px dashed black;">8 quote(s) from
publication full text</span> (mean similarity 100%)</i></p>
<pre>
Here are the PRECIS-2 domain scores and explanations for the given full text:

1. Eligibility criteria

Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants had established CVD or an estimated five-year CVD risk of ≥15%, with indications for antiplatelet, statin and ≥2 blood pressure lowering drugs&quot;</span>

Score: [3] The eligibility criteria include both patients with established CVD and those at high estimated risk, which matches usual care. However, they had to have indications for all the polypill components, which may exclude some patients who would normally receive some of the treatments. Overall this seems a mix of pragmatic and explanatory elements.

2. Recruitment

Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants randomized to the ‘polypill-based strategy’ received a polypill containing aspirin 75 mg, simvastatin 40 mg, lisinopril 10 mg and either atenolol 50 mg or hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg. Participants randomized to ‘usual care’ continued with separate medications and doses as prescribed by their doctor.&quot;</span>  

Score: [4] Participants were randomized after being recruited, implying they were already receiving care. No special efforts beyond usual care are mentioned. Overall recruitment seems mostly pragmatic.

3. Setting

Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;We conducted a randomized, open-label trial involving 623 participants from Australian general practices.&quot;</span>

Score: [4] Conducted in general practices makes it close to usual care. Multi-center increases generalizability. Overall a pragmatic setting.

4. Organization

Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;All participants were treated by their regular doctor following randomization.&quot;</span>

Score: [5] No changes were made to care delivery, so very pragmatic on this domain.

5. Flexibility: Delivery

Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Those allocated to the polypill-based strategy were prescribed one of the polypill versions at the discretion of their doctor.&quot;</span>

Score: [4] The polypill was prescribed but doctors could modify as needed, so delivery was mostly flexible like usual care.

6. Flexibility: Adherence 

Quote: No measures to enforce adherence are mentioned.

Score: [5] Very pragmatic, with no special measures to improve adherence.

7. Follow-up

Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants attended the primary healthcare centres for trial assessments at randomization and 12 month intervals thereafter.&quot;</span>

Score: [3] Follow-up visits were scheduled but at 12 month intervals, which seems moderately pragmatic.

8. Primary Outcome  

Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Primary outcomes were self-reported use of indicated combination treatment&quot;</span> [...] <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;at study end; and changes in systolic BP and total cholesterol from baseline to study end.&quot;</span>

Score: [4] The outcomes are clinically relevant measures that matter to patients.

9. Primary Analysis

Quote: No details provided on analysis plan.

Score: [NA] The text does not contain enough information to assess.</pre>

publication full text</span> (mean similarity 99.9%)</i></p>
<pre>
Here are the PRECIS-2 domain scores and explanations for the given trial:

1. Eligibility criteria 
Score: [3]

Relevant quotes:
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Patients were eligible for inclusion if they were aged 16 years or older and presented within 3 weeks after sustaining a displaced fracture of the proximal humerus that involved the surgical neck.&quot;</span>
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Excluded patients had associated dislocation of the injured shoulder joint, open fracture, insufficient mental capacity to understand the trial or instructions for rehabilitation, comorbidities precluding surgery or anesthesia, clear indication for surgery such as severe soft-tissue compromise, multiple injuries (upper limb fractures), pathological fracture (other than osteoporotic), terminal illness, or were not a resident in the hospital catchment area.&quot;</span>

The eligibility criteria are moderately pragmatic. Patients of all adult ages are included, which is pragmatic. However, patients with comorbidities precluding surgery are excluded, as well as those with clear indications for surgery, which makes it more explanatory. Overall, I think it balances out to be equally pragmatic and explanatory.

2. Recruitment
Score: [4] 
Relevant quotes: 
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Patients received their allocated treatment from the recruiting hospital.&quot;</span>

The patients seem to be recruited during routine care at the participating hospitals. There is no mention of any special recruitment efforts like media campaigns or incentives. This makes recruitment rather pragmatic.

3. Setting
Score: [4]

Relevant quotes:  
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The PROFHER collaborators recruited patients for this pragmatic, open, multicenter, parallel-group, superiority, randomized clinical trial between September 2008 and April 2011 from orthopedic departments (fracture clinics or wards) at 32 acute UK National Health Service hospitals.&quot;</span>

The trial is conducted at 32 acute NHS hospitals across the UK that routinely provide standard surgical and nonsurgical fracture treatment. This multicenter design across routine care settings is a rather pragmatic choice.

4. Organization
Score: [4]

Relevant quotes:
<span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 99%):

Care pathways for all patients included outpatientand community-based rehabilitation, which primarily comprised 1 or more 1-on-1 sessions with a physiotherapist that focused on restoring function.' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;Care pathways for all patients included outpatient- and community-based rehabilitation, which primarily comprised 1 or more 1-on-1 sessions with a physiotherapist that focused on restoring function.&quot;</span>

The organization of care delivery seems very similar to usual care, with standard rehabilitation sessions. No extra staffing, training or resources are mentioned. This is a rather pragmatic choice.

5. Flexibility: Delivery
Score: [4]

Relevant quotes: 
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;It was emphasized that good standards of care, both surgical and nonsurgical, should be provided throughout the treatment pathway for the injury, including surgical care or management of the sling, postoperative care, and rehabilitation in both groups.&quot;</span>

The delivery of the interventions is flexible and left up to the providers' discretion per their standard practices. This is a rather pragmatic approach.

6. Flexibility: Adherence
Score: [5] 

Relevant quotes:
No measures to enforce or improve adherence are mentioned.

There seem to be no special measures to make patients adhere to the assigned treatment. This is very pragmatic.

7. Follow-up 
Score: [3]

Relevant quotes:
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Follow-up was up to 2 years (until April 2013) for all patients.&quot;</span> 
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The OSS was collected by postal questionnaires at 6, 12 and 24 months.&quot;</span>

The 2 year follow-up period is longer than usual care. However, data collection relied only on mailed questionnaires, which is moderately pragmatic. Overall, follow-up intensity is equally pragmatic and explanatory. 

8. Primary outcome
Score: [5] 

Relevant quotes:  
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The primary outcome was the Oxford Shoulder Score (OSS), which is a shoulder-specific outcome measure validated in a UK population.&quot;</span>

The OSS is a patient-reported outcome directly relevant to participants. This is very pragmatic.

9. Primary analysis
Score: [5]

Relevant quotes:
No details provided to suggest anything other than intention-to-treat analysis.

In the absence of any mention otherwise, the analysis seems to be a very pragmatic intention-to-treat approach.</pre>

publication full text</span> (mean similarity 99.9%)</i></p>
<pre>
Here are the PRECIS-2 domain scores and explanations for the given trial:

Eligibility criteria 
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Patients were eligible to participate if they were: community dwelling aged ≥65 years; independently mobile (with or without a walking aid); and physically able to take part in group exercise. Patients were excluded if they: had experienced ≥3 falls in the previous year; had unstable clinical conditions; would be unable to follow instructions about exercise safely; or were receiving palliative care.&quot;</span>

Score: [3] The eligibility criteria are moderately pragmatic. The trial is limited to community-dwelling older adults who are mobile and able to participate in group exercise. However, they exclude some patients who may benefit from the intervention in usual care, such as those with a history of falls or unstable conditions. Overall, the criteria strike a balance between being pragmatic and ensuring patient safety.

Recruitment
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Practices were recruited with assistance from Primary Care Research Networks for London, Derby, and Nottingham. Patients aged ≥65 years were identified by searches of computerised medical records and invited to participate by letter from their GP.&quot;</span> 

Score: [4] Recruitment is done through primary care practices, which is moderately pragmatic as this is where most older patients receive care. Patients are identified from medical records and invited by letter, which requires some additional effort beyond usual care. Overall, recruitment methods are more pragmatic than explanatory.

Setting
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;A three-arm, parallel-design cluster controlled trial was used, with allocation at the level of general practice in two centres (London and Nottingham/Derby).&quot;</span>

Score: [4] The trial is conducted in a primary care setting, which matches usual care. Using multiple centers increases generalizability. Overall, the setting is pragmatic.

Organisation
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The FaME intervention took place in a group once a week and included exercises to be carried out at home, unsupervised, twice weekly. The OEP was undertaken at home, unsupervised, and comprised exercises to be done three times per week.&quot;</span>

Score: [4] The interventions utilize existing primary care staff and resources. Some training is provided, but not substantially beyond usual care. The organization is moderately pragmatic.

Flexibility: delivery
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The programmes included the following progression: OEP — ankle weights and hand holds; and FaME — resistance bands and hand holds, plus a move to more dynamic balance work and floor work with postural stability instructors.&quot;</span>

Score: [3] There is some flexibility in intervention delivery, such as exercise progression, but instructors provide guidance. The protocol is not highly prescriptive but also not completely flexible. This domain is equally pragmatic and explanatory.

Flexibility: adherence 
Quote: No relevant quotes.

Score: [NA] Adherence is not discussed, so this domain cannot be scored.

Follow-up
Quote: <span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 99.5%):

Participants were followed up every 6 months after the end of the intervention period, until 24 months. The primary time point was chosen as 12 months postintervention to match other trials.' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;Participants were followed up every 6 months after the end of the intervention period, until 24 months. The primary time point was chosen as 12 months post-intervention to match other trials.&quot;</span>

Score: [3] Follow-up is more frequent than usual care to assess long-term outcomes. However, follow-up does not seem overly intensive. This domain is equally pragmatic and explanatory.

Primary outcome
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The primary outcome was the proportion of participants who reported reaching ≥150 minutes of MVPA per week.&quot;</span> 

Score: [5] The primary outcome of physical activity level is highly relevant and important to participants. It matches guidelines for recommended activity in this population. This is a pragmatic choice.

Primary analysis
Quote: No relevant quotes.

Score: [NA] The analysis plan is not described, so this domain cannot be scored.</pre>

publication full text</span> (mean similarity 100%)</i></p>
<pre>
Here are the PRECIS-2 domain scores and explanations for the given clinical trial text:

Eligibility criteria:

Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants were included who scored >2 on the General Health Questionnaire 12, a measure of psychological distress, or >7 on the anxiety and depression subscales of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, thus confirming they had low mood.&quot;</span>

The eligibility criteria are focused on including patients with confirmed low mood based on validated questionnaires. This is more selective than simply including all patients with multiple sclerosis who may receive this intervention in usual care.

Score: [2] Rather explanatory

Recruitment:

Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Those allocated to intervention were invited to attend a psychological adjustment group for six sessions over 12 weeks.&quot;</span> 

Participants were recruited and then randomly allocated to intervention or control groups. No details are provided on how recruitment was done. Without further information, it is unclear if extra effort beyond usual care was made to recruit participants.

Score: [NA]

Setting: 

No quotes. The setting is not described.

Score: [NA] 

Organization:

Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The groups were delivered by two Band 5 assistant psychologists, who were supervised by a Band 8a clinical psychologist, experienced in working with people with multiple sclerosis.&quot;</span>

The intervention requires trained psychologists to deliver, which may not be available in usual care. This makes the organization more explanatory.

Score: [2] Rather explanatory

Flexibility (delivery):

No quotes. Details on flexibility in delivering the intervention are not provided.

Score: [NA]

Flexibility (adherence): 

No quotes. Details on flexibility in adherence are not provided.

Score: [NA]

Follow-up:

Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Four and eight months after random allocation, participants were sent a booklet of outcome questionnaires to complete and return by post.&quot;</span>

Follow-up is more frequent than usual care and involves mailing questionnaires to collect more extensive data. This makes follow-up more explanatory.

Score: [2] Rather explanatory

Primary outcome:

Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Effectiveness was initially defined as the change in EQ-5D scores and a cost-effectiveness analysis was performed using this outcome measure.&quot;</span>

The EQ-5D is a generic quality of life measure that may not be the most relevant outcome to participants. Using a more disease-specific outcome like depression severity could be more pragmatic.

Score: [2] Rather explanatory

Primary analysis: 

No quotes. Details of the primary analysis are not provided.

<p><i><span style="border-bottom: 1px dashed black;">6 quote(s) from
publication full text</span> (mean similarity 99.7%)</i></p>
<pre>
Here are the PRECIS-2 domain scores and explanations for the given clinical trial text:

1. Eligibility criteria

Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The inclusion criteria were being definitely diagnosed with MS and having records in the Society and the exclusion criteria having history of other psychiatric disorders including major depressive disorder (according to the medical records and the physician's examinations) or bipolar disorder (except for cognitive disorders by which MS is characterized), substance dependency, any neurological disorders, history of taking corticosteroids or the disease recurrence within the previous six months.&quot;</span>

Explanation: The eligibility criteria seem moderately pragmatic as patients with a definite diagnosis of MS were included, which is similar to usual care. However, patients with major psychiatric disorders were excluded even though depression and anxiety are common in MS patients. This may limit the generalizability of the results.

Score: [3] 

2. Recruitment

Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Because the patients were not hospitalized and regularly referred to the Association, to follow randomized assignment, we decided to run the sampling within two consecutive months until we enrolled an adequate number of participants.&quot;</span>

Explanation: Patients were recruited as they presented to the MS Society, which seems moderately pragmatic like usual care. However, they were recruited in a limited time frame rather than continuously.

Score: [3]

3. Setting

Quote: <span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 98.2%):

This clinical trial was conducted in 2015e2016 and registered as IRCT2014112420064N1 in the Iranian Register of Clinical Trials. The study population consists the patients referring to the Multiple Sclerosis Society of Isfahan.' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;This study was conducted in 2015e2016 and registered as IRCT2014112420064N1 in the Iranian Register of Clinical Trials. The study population consists the patients referring to the Multiple Sclerosis Society of Isfahan.&quot;</span>  

Explanation: The trial was conducted at a single MS Society, which may not represent the full range of settings where MS patients receive care. A more pragmatic design would use multiple centers.

Score: [2] 

4. Organization

Quote: NA

Explanation: The text does not provide information about staffing, resources, or expertise required to deliver the intervention.

Score: [NA]

5. Flexibility: delivery

Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The intervention was implemented within two days a week. For the control group, a routine protocol was conducted. For blinding, the patients of the control group referred to the Society on certain days of week and those of the experimental on other days.&quot;</span>

Explanation: The Fordyce Happiness Model intervention was delivered in a structured format over 8 sessions, suggesting limited flexibility like an explanatory trial. Details of the control group protocol are not provided.  

Score: [2]

6. Flexibility: adherence 

Quote: NA

Explanation: The text does not mention any strategies to enforce or monitor adherence.

Score: [NA] 

7. Follow-up

Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;To assess the reliability of the instruments used in this study, split-half reliability was used. Pearson's correlation coefficient was estimated to be 0.79 and 0.89 for the half of the DASS-21 and the Piper Standard Scale, respectively.&quot;</span>

Explanation: Outcomes were assessed at baseline, immediately post-intervention, and at 3 months. The 3 month follow-up is longer than usual care but does not seem overly intensive.

Score: [4]

8. Primary outcome  

Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;To investigate depression, anxiety, and stress, DASS-21, developed by Lovibond and Lovibond in 1995, was used and its validity and reliability were confirmed [17]. To measure fatigue, the Piper Standard Scale was used.&quot;</span>

Explanation: The primary outcomes of depression, anxiety, stress and fatigue are patient-important outcomes in MS. However, they were assessed with standardized scales not used routinely in practice.  

Score: [3]

9. Primary analysis

Quote: NA

Explanation: The text does not provide details about the primary analysis method.

Eligibility criteria:

Quotes:
<span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 97.6%):

Persons with MS (N ¼ 183) with cognitive concerns were randomly assigned to either the 8week MAPSS-MS intervention or usual care plus freely available computer games.' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;Persons with MS (N 1⁄4 183) with cognitive concerns were randomly assigned to either the 8-week MAPSS-MS intervention or usual care plus freely available computer games.&quot;</span>

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The Perceived Deficits Questionnaire was administered by phone, and those scoring at least 10 (indicating some problems in at least 5 areas) were eligible to participate.&quot;</span>

Explanation: The trial included people with MS who had subjective cognitive concerns, as assessed by the Perceived Deficits Questionnaire. No other major exclusions were mentioned. This seems reasonably similar to patients who would receive this intervention in usual practice.

Score: [4] Rather pragmatic

Recruitment:

Quotes:  
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants were recruited via physician referral, targeted mailings to persons with MS on the mailing list of the National MS Society, contact with support groups, and notices in MS newsletters and web sites.&quot;</span>

Explanation: Participants were recruited through multiple routes including physician referral, MS Society contacts, and support groups. This seems like a moderately intensive recruitment effort, but one that is feasible to implement in real-world settings.

Score: [3] Equally pragmatic and explanatory  

Setting: 

Quotes:
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Following approval by the Institutional Review Board for the University of Texas at Austin, participants were recruited from three large metropolitan communities in Texas: Houston, San Antonio and Dallas.&quot;</span>

Explanation: The trial was conducted across multiple sites in three major cities. This seems reasonably similar to real-world settings where the intervention could be implemented.

Score: [4] Rather pragmatic

Organization:

Quotes:
No relevant quotes.

Explanation: The paper does not provide information about resources, staffing, or care delivery model.

Score: [NA] 

Flexibility of experimental intervention - delivery:

Quotes:

Follow-up:

Quotes:
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Neuropsychological testing and questionnaire data were collected from all subjects at baseline, following completion of the intervention, and 3 and 6 months post-intervention.&quot;</span>

Explanation: Outcomes were assessed at baseline, post-intervention, and two follow-up times. This seems like a reasonable follow-up schedule that could be implemented in real-world practice.

Score: [4] Rather pragmatic

Primary outcome:

Quotes:  
<span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 99.6%):

The primary purpose of this study was to determine the effectiveness of a novel computerassisted cognitive rehabilitation intervention MAPSS-MS (Memory, Attention, Problem Solving Skills in MS) in a multi-site trial with persons with MS.' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;The primary purpose of this study was to determine the effectiveness of a novel computer-assisted cognitive rehabilitation intervention MAPSS-MS (Memory, Attention, Problem Solving Skills in MS) in a multi-site trial with persons with MS.&quot;</span>

The 70-min battery included the following widely used tests: the Controlled Oral Word Association Test (COWAT) 26 - verbal fluency and word finding; The California Verbal Learning Test, 2nd ed, (CVLT-II) 27 - verbal learning and remembering; The Brief Visuospatial Memory Test e Revised (BVMT-R) 28 nonverbal learning and memory; The Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test (PASAT) 29 - auditory information processing speed and flexibility, as well as calculation abilities; and The Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT) 30 - complex scanning and visual tracking.' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;The 70-min battery included the following widely used tests: the Controlled Oral Word Association Test (COWAT) - verbal fluency and word finding; The California Verbal Learning Test, 2nd ed, (CVLT-II) - verbal learning and remembering; The Brief Visuospatial Memory Test e Revised (BVMT-R) - nonverbal learning and memory; The Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test (PASAT) - auditory information processing speed and flexibility, as well as calculation abilities; and The Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT) - complex scanning and visual tracking.&quot;</span>

Explanation: The primary outcomes assessed cognitive functioning in multiple domains including memory, attention, problem solving, processing speed, etc. These are clinically meaningful outcomes for MS patients.

Score: [5] Very pragmatic

Primary analysis:

Quotes: 
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Data analyses were conducted using SPSS, version 24.0 for Windows (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Neuropsychological data were scored by the testers and verified by a second staff member. Data were entered and checked for accuracy.&quot;</span>

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;For the current study, we employed intention-to-treat strategies to handle missing data using a “last observation carried forward” (LOCF) strategy in which missing data points are imputed based on the participant's existing data.&quot;</span>

Explanation: An intention-to-treat analysis was used with all available data. This is a very pragmatic approach.

Here are the PRECIS-2 domain scores and explanations for the given full text:

1. Eligibility criteria 
Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Inclusion criteria were (1) 18–60 years of age, (2) ⩽2 years since clinical diagnosis with relapsing remitting MS (RRMS) and (3) no relapses or changes in medication status 8 weeks prior to inclusion.&quot;</span>
- <span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Exclusion criteria—Pregnancy, breast feeding, uncontrolled diabetes, peptic ulcer disease, suppurative otitis media, herpes zoster, multiple sclerosis, systematic infection, sarcoidosis and other rare conditions, and an inability to provide informed consent.&quot;</span>

The eligibility criteria are moderately restrictive, excluding some patients typically seen in usual care such as pregnant women and those with comorbidities. However, the 2 year limit since diagnosis targets early RRMS patients.

Score: [3]

2. Recruitment
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Patients were recruited in collaboration with six Danish regional MS clinics and The Danish MS Society.&quot;</span>

Patients were recruited through their regular MS clinics, suggesting a pragmatic approach similar to usual care. However, collaborating with the MS Society likely involved additional effort beyond typical recruitment.

Score: [4] 

3. Setting
Quote: <span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 99.6%):

The present study is a national multicentre singleblinded parallel group randomized controlled trial (RCT) comparing two groups receiving either supervised exercise therapy (intervention group) or health education (active control group).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;The present study is a national multicentre single-blinded parallel group randomized controlled trial (RCT) comparing two groups receiving either supervised exercise therapy (intervention group) or health education (active control group).&quot;</span>

The multicenter design across regional clinics makes the setting very similar to usual care.

Score: [5]

4. Organization
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Patients received the exercise intervention in addition to usual care.&quot;</span> 

The exercise intervention was provided in addition to usual care, without substantial changes to expertise or resources.

Score: [5]

5. Flexibility: delivery
Quotes:
- <span title='Moderate quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 92.2%):

d was planned on the basis of four principles (adapted from Stathopoulos and Felson Duchan) 13 : (1) individual tailoring, (2) application of exercise types matching the goal of the intervention, (3) progressive overload and (4) sufficient intensity to induce the desired effects of the intervention.' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ff9e81'>&quot;The exercise intervention was planned on the basis of four principles (adapted from Stathopoulos and Felson Duchan)13: (1) individual tailoring, (2) application of exercise types matching the goal of the intervention, (3) progressive overload and (4) sufficient intensity to induce the desired effects of the intervention.&quot;</span>
- <span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 98.3%):

The exercise intervention followed specific principles and protocols around intensity, duration, etc. However, it was individually tailored. Overall, moderately flexible delivery.

Score: [3] 

6. Flexibility: adherence
No relevant quotes. The text does not mention any strategies to enforce or monitor adherence.

Score: [5] 

7. Follow-up
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;All patients were scanned using the exact same 3-Tesla MRI scanner (MAGNETOM Skyra, Siemens Medical Systems, Erlangen, Germany) at the same location, for all patients, and at all timepoints.&quot;</span>

Patients underwent MRI scans at baseline, 24 weeks, and 48 weeks. This follow-up schedule is more frequent than usual care to allow outcome measurement.

Score: [2]

8. Primary outcome 
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Global brain atrophy rate was quantified by the two most common methods found in the MS literature. First, as percentage brain volume change (PBVC) determined by the automated longitudinal brain change analysis tool, SIENA, part of FSL,15 using improved brain masks16 and second as percentage change of brain parenchymal fraction (BPF).&quot;</span>

The primary outcome of global brain atrophy is clinically meaningful but assessed in a specialized way not typical of usual care.

Score: [2]

9. Primary analysis
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;A multivariate repeated measurements mixed effects regression model was used to analyse longitudinal data with time and group as fixed effects.&quot;</span>

No mention of excluding participants or data from the analysis. Likely an intention-to-treat approach.

Here are the PRECIS-2 domain scores and explanations for the given clinical trial text:

1. Eligibility criteria 

Quote: <span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 99.6%):

inclusion criteria were: males and females; age 18 to 70; diagnosis of MS (primary or secondary progressive, relapsing-remitting), without relapses in the preceding three months and an Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score between 4 and 5.5' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;Inclusion criteria—Males and females; age 18 to 70; diagnosis of MS (primary or secondary progressive, relapsing-remitting), without relapses in the preceding three months and an Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score between 4 and 5.5.&quot;</span>

The eligibility criteria are reasonably broad, including adults up to age 70 with different types of MS, as long as they have an EDSS score between 4-5.5. However, excluding those with relapses in the past 3 months makes it slightly less pragmatic.

Score: [3] Equally pragmatic and explanatory 

2. Recruitment

Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Patients have been recruited at Ferrara University Hospital from patients who attend the Rehabilitation Outpatient Clinic for gait rehabilitation.&quot;</span>

Recruitment is done at a single hospital clinic that patients already attend for gait rehabilitation. This pragmatic approach recruits patients who would receive the intervention in usual care.

Score: [4] Rather pragmatic

3. Setting

Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;This work is part of a larger project concerned with ensuring that trials are designed so that their results are relevant to, and used by, patients, clinicians, and policy decision makers.&quot;</span> 

The setting is a single hospital clinic. Conducting the trial in the actual clinical setting where the intervention would be delivered is pragmatic. However, a single center limits generalizability.

Score: [3] Equally pragmatic and explanatory

4. Organization

Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;During TOCT, they received feedback (visual and auditory) from the physiotherapist.&quot;</span>

The organization seems very similar to usual care, with physiotherapist feedback. No mention of additional resources or training.

Score: [4] Rather pragmatic 

5. Flexibility: delivery

Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The methodology of how to deliver an intervention is not rigidly prescriptive in the protocol.&quot;</span>

The delivery of the intervention is flexible and left up to the providers, a pragmatic approach.

Score: [5] Very pragmatic

6. Flexibility: adherence

No relevant quotes. There is no mention of special measures to enforce adherence.

Score: [5] Very pragmatic

7. Follow-up

Quote: <span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 99.6%):

The blind evaluator, who did not supervise the training program, performed functional tests, questionnaires and instrumental measurements the week before treatment, the week after the end of the supervised-TOCT, after the 12-weeks home-based TOCT program' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;The blind evaluator, who did not supervise the training program, performed functional tests, questionnaires and instrumental measurements the week before treatment, the week after the end of the supervised-TOCT, after the 12-weeks home-based TOCT program.&quot;</span>

Follow-up schedule seems reasonable and similar to what would occur in usual care.

Score: [4] Rather pragmatic

8. Primary outcome

Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The primary outcome measure was the 6-minute walking test (6MWT) for walking endurance.&quot;</span>

The 6MWT is a meaningful outcome measure for patients.

Score: [5] Very pragmatic

9. Primary analysis

No relevant quotes. The statistical analysis is not described in detail.

Here are the PRECIS-2 domain scores and explanations for the given clinical trial text:

Eligibility criteria:

Quote: <span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 97.3%):

iteria: Age between 14 – 50 yrs, definite diagnosis of MS based on clinical manifestations and performing MRI according to McDonald’s criteria, acceptance of the 24 month protocol by the patients, not being pregnant or lactating, history of having received a kind of βinterferon under the supervision of a neurologist in a period of no more than 30 days prior to t' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;Age between 14 – 50 yrs, definite diagnosis of MS based on clinical manifestations and performing MRI according to McDonald’s criteria, acceptance of the 24 month protocol by the patients, not being pregnant or lactating, history of having received a kind of β-interferon under the supervision of a neurologist in a period of no more than 30 days prior to the study.&quot;</span>

The eligibility criteria are quite restrictive, excluding patients outside a narrow age range, those without a confirmed diagnosis, pregnant/lactating women, and patients who have not received interferon beta recently. This reduces the similarity of trial participants to real-world patients.

Score: [2] Rather explanatory

Recruitment:

Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The total sample volume was 90 patients divided into three equal groups.&quot;</span> 

No details are provided on how patients were recruited, so it is unclear if any special effort was made beyond what would occur in usual care.

Score: [NA] 

Setting:

Quote: <span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 95.1%):

Methods The study was a randomized clinical trial and included all the patients with MS referring to the Farshchian Hospital, Hamadan (West Iran) during the year 2' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;The study was a randomized clinical trial and included all the patients with MS referring to the Farshchian Hospital, Hamadan (West Iran) during the year 2005-2006&quot;</span>

The trial was conducted at a single center, which limits generalizability. However, no details are provided on whether this setting matches usual care.

Score: [NA]

Organisation: 

No relevant quotes. No details provided on resources, expertise, or care delivery.

Score: [NA]

Flexibility (delivery):

Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;According to the inclusion criteria the patients were treated as follows: 30 patients received Av (30 mcg IM on a weekly basis), 30 patients received Re (44 mcg SC three times a week) and 30 patients received Be (250 mcg SC on an alternate day basis).&quot;</span>

The intervention delivery seems highly specified and protocol-driven regarding dose, schedule, and route. This reduces flexibility compared to usual care.

Score: [2] Rather explanatory

Flexibility (adherence):

No relevant quotes. No details provided on measures to enforce or encourage adherence.

Score: [NA]

Follow-up:

Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The patients in all three groups were evaluated at the end of months 6, 12, 18, 24 and in case of development of reactions were excluded from the study.&quot;</span>

Follow-up seems more frequent than would occur in usual care. However, no other details on intensity are provided.

Score: [3] Equally pragmatic and explanatory

Primary outcome: 

Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;At the end of 24 months the patients were again evaluated for EDSS, and the number of relapses for each patient was calculated (cases of pseudoexacerbation were not considered as relapse).&quot;</span>

The EDSS disability scale is clinically relevant for MS patients. Relapse rate is also a patient-important outcome.

Score: [4] Rather pragmatic

Primary analysis:

No relevant quotes. No details provided on analysis methods.

Here are the PRECIS-2 domain assessments for the given full text:

Eligibility criteria:

Relevant quotes:

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Patients with multiple sclerosis were randomly selected into treated and control groups; only patients who could walk with or without walking aids were admitted to the trial, and these cases were initially assessed and scored during an inactive phase of the disease.&quot;</span>

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Patients with diabetes mellitus or hypertension or who gave a history of psychiatric illness or peptic ulcer were not admitted to the treated group.&quot;</span> 

Reasoning: The trial selected patients with multiple sclerosis who could walk, excluding those with comorbidities that would preclude corticotrophin treatment. This matches usual care eligibility reasonably closely.

Score: [4]

Recruitment:

Relevant quotes: 

No relevant quotes. The participants were already diagnosed with multiple sclerosis. 

Reasoning: The recruitment path is not described. I assume participants were recruited during regular clinic visits, which would match usual care.

Score: [4] 

Setting:

Relevant quotes:

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;To obtain an adequate number of cases for statistical purposes similar studies were carried out at the same time in three cities and this had the added advantage that they could&quot;</span>control<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;one another.&quot;</span>

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The total results were obtained by adding the results from the three cities; this was considered justifiable since the methods of selection, treatment, and scoring were essentially the same.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial was conducted across multiple hospitals/cities, reasonably matching the usual care setting.

Score: [4]

Organisation:

Relevant quotes:

No relevant quotes suggesting differences from usual care resources/staffing.

Reasoning: The organisation appears to match usual care.

Score: [4] 

Flexibility (delivery):

Relevant quotes:

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The treated group were given corticotrophin (’Acthar’ gel) in a dosage which varied between 15 and 25 units daily, potassium chloride orally, and a low-salt diet.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The intervention delivery followed a protocol with fixed corticotrophin dosing. This reduces flexibility compared to usual care.

Score: [2]

Flexibility (adherence): 

Relevant quotes:

No relevant quotes.

Reasoning: Adherence measures are not described. I assume flexibility matches usual care.  

Score: [4]

Follow-up:

Relevant quotes:  

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;All cases were seen at three-monthly intervals and scored on the Kurtzke (1961) scale; relapses lasting longer than twenty-four hours were also scored by a system in the three centres.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: Follow-up visits every 3 months are more frequent than usual care. 

Score: [2]

Primary outcome:

Relevant quotes:

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;There was no evidence that treatment prevented deterioration or reduced the number or severity of the relapses when compared with 169 control patients observed and scored in a similar way for the same period of time.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The primary outcome of relapse rate and disability progression are highly relevant to patients.

Score: [5] 

Primary analysis:

Relevant quotes:

No relevant quotes suggesting deviation from intention-to-treat.

Reasoning: I assume a standard intention-to-treat analysis was used.

Score: [4]</pre>

a Men and women aged 18–65 years with relapsing forms of MS, as defined by the 2005 revised McDonald criteria [14], and an Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) Calkwood et al. BMC Neurology 2014, 14:220 Page 2 of 11 http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2377/14/220 score of 0–5.5 were eligible to participate in the stud' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;Men and women aged 18–65 years with relapsing forms of MS, as defined by the 2005 revised McDonald criteria, and an Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score of 0–5.5 were eligible to participate in the study.&quot;</span>

The eligibility criteria are fairly broad, including adult men and women up to age 65 with relapsing forms of MS, based on standard diagnostic criteria, and with mild to moderate disability levels. This suggests the trial aimed to enroll a patient population similar to those who would receive fingolimod in real-world practice. However, some patients with more severe disability may have been excluded.

Score: [4] Rather pragmatic

Patients were identified by their treating physicians as candidates for a therapy switch, rather than recruited through advertising or other special efforts. This matches how patients would be selected for a new therapy in routine practice.

The 30-day follow-up period is longer than usual care.

Score: [2] Rather explanatory

8. Primary outcome  

Quote: <span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 98.7%):

The TSQM measures patient satisfaction with medication, which is a patient-centered outcome.

Score: [5] Very pragmatic

9. Primary analysis

Here are the PRECIS-2 domain scores and explanations for the given full text:

1. Eligibility criteria

Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Inclusion criteria—Patients with confirmed diagnosis: ≥16 years of age with unilateral facial nerve weakness of no identifiable cause who presented to primary care or an emergency department and could be referred to a collaborating otorhinolaryngologist <72 hours after the onset of symptoms.&quot;</span>

Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Exclusion criteria—Pregnancy, breast feeding, uncontrolled diabetes, peptic ulcer disease, suppurative otitis media, herpes zoster, multiple sclerosis, systematic infection, sarcoidosis and other rare conditions, and an inability to provide informed consent.&quot;</span> 

Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Extra test—Randomised controlled trial of Bell’s palsy treatment required senior otorhinolaryngologist in hospitals to confirm a patient’s eligibility to participate. Bell’s palsy is usually diagnosed by a general practitioner in primary care.&quot;</span>

The eligibility criteria are rather explanatory as they exclude certain patients like pregnant women and require extra confirmation by a specialist, which is not done in usual care.

Score: [2]

2. Recruitment

No relevant quotes found. The full text does not provide information about how patients were recruited.

Score: [NA] 

3. Setting

Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Single centre and specialised centre (Madigan Army Medical Center, USA), unlikely to be the usual setting for most individuals receiving physiotherapy for shoulder impingement.&quot;</span>

The setting being a single specialized center is less pragmatic and more explanatory compared to usual care settings.  

Score: [2]

4. Organization

No relevant quotes found. The full text does not provide information about resources, expertise, and care organization.

Score: [NA]

5. Flexibility: delivery

No relevant quotes found. The full text does not provide information about flexibility in delivering the intervention. 

Score: [NA]

6. Flexibility: adherence

No relevant quotes found. The full text does not provide information about flexibility in adherence.

Score: [NA]

7. Follow-up

Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Clinical follow-up until patient left hospital (discharge or death) or until 30 days after surgery, whichever was the longer, so more than usual care.&quot;</span>

Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Monitoring intensity involved more extensive data collection than usual: Pre-operation—three-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) Holter monitor (Flashcard with 2×48 hour recording) set up on each patient and maintained for 72 hours. Troponin values at 1, 3, and 7 days after surgery (more usual for only 1 and 3 days after surgery) ECG after randomisation and at 7 and 30 days after surgery.&quot;</span>

Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Unscheduled follow-up visits triggered by primary outcome: a cardiovascular event (such as angina, myocardial infarction, stroke)&quot;</span>

The follow-up is more intensive than usual care with more frequent visits, extensive data collection, and triggered visits. This is more explanatory.

Score: [2] 

8. Primary outcome

Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Primary outcome—Recovery of facial function as rated on the House-Brackmann scale.&quot;</span> 

Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Test not routinely used in primary care and requires training. It is, however, an easy clinical test widely used in secondary care for grading recovery from facial nerve paralysis caused by damage to lower motor neurons.&quot;</span>

Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Central adjudication—Photographs taken of patients were assessed and graded independently by a panel of three experts (not general practitioners, who usually assess).&quot;</span>

The primary outcome requires specialized tests and central adjudication not used in usual care. This is more explanatory.

Score: [2]

9. Primary analysis

PRECIS is a tool to help trialists make
design decisions consistent with the
intended purpose of their trial. This
paper gives guidance on how to use an
improved, validated version, PRECIS-2,
which has been developed with the
help of over 80 international trialists,
clinicians, and policymakers. Keeping
the original simple wheel format,
PRECIS-2 has nine domains—eligibility
criteria, recruitment, setting,
organisation, flexibility (delivery),
flexibility (adherence), follow-up,
primary outcome, and primary
analysis—scored from 1 (very
explanatory) to 5 (very pragmatic) to
facilitate domain discussion and
consensus. It is hoped PRECIS-2 will be
valuable in supporting the explicit
matching of design decisions to how
the trial results are intended to be used
Randomised trials are hard work. Like much that is
hard, this toil is only worth it because of the prospect of
a substantial reward. For many important stakeholders
(patients or others who may benefit from an interven-
tion, funders of healthcare and of research, practi-
tioners who may deliver clinical care and often the
researchers themselves) the anticipated reward for a
trial is that the results can be used to directly support
decisions on delivering an intervention that will
improve health outcomes for patients and the public.
Key to this reward is that the trial can indeed support
end user decisions in the ways intended by the trial
design team. That this is not always, or even mostly, the
case was highlighted nearly 50 years ago, by Schwartz
and Lellouch in their paper on pragmatic and explana-
tory attitudes to randomised controlled trials.
1
Simply put, these authors describe two purposes for
randomised trials. A pragmatic randomised trial is
undertaken in the “real world” and with usual care and
is intended to help support a decision on whether to
deliver an intervention. An explanatory randomised
trial is undertaken in an idealised setting, to give the
initiative under evaluation its best chance to demon-
strate a beneficial effect. 
2-4 
These two approaches repre-
sent different attitudes to decision making on the
usefulness of interventions. Moreover, although we will
refer to trials as having an explanatory or a pragmatic
intention throughout this paper, we recognise that
there is no simple threshold and that there are few
purely explanatory or pragmatic trials; rather than
dichotomy there is a continuum.
There is widespread concern that explanatory ran-
domised trials can be poor predictors of the real world
effectiveness of the interventions they test.
4-7 
Schwartz
and Lellouch suggested that trialists often wish to inform
a real world decision, but, almost by default, tend to
design trials that are more explanatory than they should
be given the designers’ intention. The original PRECIS
(PRagmatic Explanatory Continuum Indicator Summary)
tool was developed in 2005–08 by 25 international trial-
ists and methodologists
8 
to help trialists work through
their design decisions so that they might avoid designing
a trial that did not match their own intentions for the
trial. There is demand for such tools; PRECIS has been
cited over 300 times since 2009, it is one of eight “useful
papers” for trialists listed on the UK National Institute for
Health Research Randomised Trials Methods website
(www.nets.nihr.ac.uk/resources/trials-coordination),
and many investigators have used PRECIS prospectively
and retrospectively to consider trial design. 
9 
While
acknowledging the usefulness of PRECIS, these latter
authors have identified weaknesses, including unclear
face validity and inter-rater reliability, the lack of a scor-
ing system, redundancy in some PRECIS domains, and
the need for more guidance on how to use the tool.
This paper describes a new version of PRECIS, PRE-
CIS-2, which aims to address these (and other) weak-
nesses while keeping the strengths of the original tool,
especially its simple format. The paper also provides
guidance on how to use the tool. As with the original
2009 PRECIS tool, we intend PRECIS-2 to be used at the
design stage of a trial in order to help trialists make the
purpose of their trial explicit and to ensure that their
design choices are concordant with their intended
Summary pointS
PRECIS (2009) was a tool with 10 domains to design clinical trials on a continuum of
explanatory attitude (ideal situation) to more pragmatic attitude (usual care)
Cited over 300 times by end of 2014, but weaknesses have been highlighted: no rating
scale, problems with some domains, needing better guidance, and not validated
This paper presents PRECIS-2—a validated, improved version of the tool—together
with guidance for how to use it
PRECIS-2 has nine domains including three new ones (recruitment, setting, and
organisation), each scored on a 5-point Likert continuum (from 1=very explanatory
“ideal conditions” to 5=very pragmatic “usual care conditions”) so that trialists,
clinicians, and policymakers can more easily consider whether design decisions
match their intended purpose

methods
This work is part of a larger project concerned with
ensuring that trials are designed so that their results are
relevant to, and used by, patients, clinicians, and policy
decision makers.
9 
This paper presents the PRECIS-2 tool
and gives guidance on how to use it but does not pres-
ent in full the work that led to it, which will be pub-
lished separately (see Loudon et al
9 
or contact the
authors for more information).
Briefly, we ran a two-round Delphi communication
with contact authors who had cited PRECIS but who
had neither been involved in the original development
of PRECIS nor evaluated the utility of PRECIS. We dis-
cussed how to improve PRECIS, focusing on issues
raised by PRECIS users
 
9 
and brainstorming with trial-
ists in Dundee. The Delphi results were the basis for a
brainstorming meeting in Toronto involving some of
the original developers of PRECIS plus some of those
who had undertaken methodological work using PRE-
CIS, together with clinicians and policymakers. We
then user-tested candidate PRECIS-2 models, with 19
international trialists, on a one-to-one basis (in person
or via Skype). PRECIS-2 was modified in response to
user testing.
The version of PRECIS-2 that finally emerged was
used in validity and reliability testing by 19 raters.
These 19 raters had responded to an invitation we sent
to 33 individuals, identified from four sources: the
Delphi, user testing, the Toronto brainstorming meet-
ing, and through our personal networks of experienced
trialists. From these groups, 19 accepted the invitation
(six from the Delphi, two from user testing, three from
the Toronto meeting, and eight from our networks). The
raters were asked to score a varied sample of 15 trial pro-
tocols. These protocols were purposefully selected to
range from highly pragmatic to highly explanatory,
including both drug and non-drug trials. This testing
gave support for the proposed version of PRECIS 2,
which is the version discussed in this paper.
Focus of prECiS-2
The PRECIS-2 tool focuses on trial design choices which
determine the applicability of a trial. Applicability (the
ability for a trial result to be applied or used in a partic-
ular situation) is the outcome of these choices, which
affect the ease with which the trial results can be
applied to and by the usual community of users of the
intervention in the settings in which the trial designers
envisioned it being used. This may, of course, vary for
different readers, and thus applicability has both
“local” and more distant meanings. The aim of a highly
pragmatic trial would be to maximise applicability of
the intervention to usual care across a range of local
and distant settings. The aim of a highly explanatory
trial would be to maximise the intervention’s chance of
demonstrating an effect through the expected mecha-
nism, with little attention paid to the issue of whether
this outcome would be achieved under real world con-
ditions, neither locally nor in more distant settings.
Applicability is a continuum, and various trial design
choices can make a trial more, or less, applicable; in
other words more or less pragmatic.
In general, pragmatic trials are focused on care in the
most common settings and are less commonly focused
on highly specialised care settings. However, we believe
that, even in specialised settings, a trial can be more or
less applicable depending on the degree to which it pro-
vides care with resources and clinicians standard in
that setting, to patients who are typical of that setting.
Note that pragmatism constitutes only a close matching
between the care delivered in the setting in which the
trial was conducted and the care delivered in the setting
to which its results are applied. This close matching
provides directly applicable information and thus helps
decision makers choose whether to implement the
intervention tested in the trial.
How to use prECiS-2
The tool has been developed to be used by a multidisci-
plinary team throughout the process of designing their
trial. This team will usually include expertise in the par-
ticular intervention and health service setting in which
the intervention will be used, should it be shown to be
effective, as well as statistical expertise.
There are four steps to using PRECIS-2, which may be
iterative if there remains a gap between the intended
purpose of the trial and the initial design choices,
which will be revealed as the developing design is
viewed through the prism of the PRECIS-2 tool.
Step 1: What design approach are you taking?
The first step is to be clear about your intention or atti-
tude to the trial you are designing. Are you
What is new in PRECIS-2 compared with PRECIS
• A scale for all domains which can be scored from 1 (very explanatory) to 5 (very
pragmatic)
• Eligibility criteria has been placed on the 12 o’clock spoke
• Clockwise use of PRECIS-2 with logical ordering of adjacent domains
• The participant eligibility criterion (which might formerly have been thought of as
including issues of setting and issues of multicentre trials) has been separated into
“Eligibility” and “Setting”
• New domains of “Recruitment” and “Organization”,
• Domain name changes:
– 
From “Practitioner adherence” to “Flexibility: delivery”
– 
From “Participant compliance” to “Flexibility: adherence”
– From “Follow up intensity” to “Follow up”
– From “Outcome” to “Primary outcome”
• Removal of the comparison intervention domains of “Practitioner expertise” and
“Flexibility of the comparison intervention”
• Domain name labels on the PRECIS-2 wheel now come with short explanations
• Improved guidance on how to use PRECIS-2

• Aiming to take an explanatory approach to answer
the question, “Can this intervention work under ideal
conditions?”
• Aiming to take a pragmatic approach to answer the
question, “Does this intervention work under usual
conditions?”
Both approaches to trial design have their place, but
trialists should be clear which they would prefer to
emphasise for the trial they are designing. As men-
tioned previously, trialists have often emphasised the
first approach by default rather than as a deliberate
decision.
1
Step 2: Consider your trial design choices for each
of the PRECIS-2 domains
This step is explained in more detail for each domain
later on. Imagining first the most pragmatic and the
most explanatory design choice you could make for
each domain may help you in deciding how you wish to
implement that domain choice, and thus how prag-
matic or explanatory you want your actual decision on
that domain to be.
Before discussing the domains further, we should
clarify what is meant by “participant.” Participants
include patients or other individual recipients of an
intervention, or providers of the intervention, or both.
This may include individual participants or one or
more levels of clusters. For example, in a trial of a con-
tinuing education intervention, participants may be
health professionals and trained instructors, and the
trial may be randomised into clusters at the level of the
instructor. In some cluster trials, if randomisation
occurs at two levels (such as organisation and individ-
ual participants), scoring of the domains may need to
be considered separately.
Step 3: Score 1 to 5 for the choices made in Step 2
and mark on the PRECIS-2 wheel
If there is uncertainty over how explanatory or prag-
matic your proposed trial design element is for a partic-
ular domain, then we suggest the score for this domain
should be left blank; this will highlight the uncertainty
and encourage discussion. Domains which have greater
scoring variation by raters probably require further dis-
cussion and reiteration of steps 1 to 4 to clarify the
design of this domain so there is greater agreement.
Having considered your design choices in Step 2,
position your choice for each domain on the PRECIS-2
wheel to record how pragmatic or explanatory these
choices are for each domain. Scoring each domain can
be done using a 5-point Likert scale:
1. Very explanatory
2. Rather explanatory
3. Equally pragmatic and explanatory
4. Rather pragmatic
5. Very pragmatic.
A toolkit with guidance and practical help is available
to download from www.precis-2.org. The appendix on
this website provides four examples of comparative
effectiveness trials with explanations of our scoring
decisions for the PRECIS-2 domains: a cluster ran-
domised trial in rural India to improve maternal and
newborn health,
10 
a pharmacological primary care trial
in UK to control asthma, 
11 
an international music ther-
apy trial to treat preschool children with autism, 
12 
and
an international surgical trial for coronary angiogra-
phy.
13 
None of these trials, as far as we are aware, was
designed using the PRECIS tool, and they do not refer to
the Schwartz and Lellouch paper, 
1 
so this is a post facto
assessment, but nevertheless gives the reader some
idea of how each domain may vary from pragmatic to
explanatory.
Step 4: Review the PRECIS-2 wheel
Review your set of nine domain design choices (Step 2)
on the PRECIS-2 wheel (figure) to see whether they will
produce a trial that will support the overall aim you
identified for your trial in Step 1. Go back to Step 2 and
modify your design choices if required.
the nine domains of prECiS-2
PRECIS-2 has nine domains, each of which is intended
to help trialists think about the consequences of that
design decision for applicability of the results of their
trial. The PRECIS-2 tool is focused exclusively on the
issue of applicability, and readers should use other
tools to assess the internal validity or any other aspect
of their design choices.
Each domain encourages trialists to think about their
trial and the recipients in the usual care situation in
which their results might be applied if the intervention
proves beneficial. If trialists are aiming for high applica-
bility (that is, a pragmatic approach to design decisions),

then we would expect the match between trial and
usual care to be very good. If trialists are aiming to give
the intervention its best shot at showing a benefit (that
is, an explanatory approach), then the match between
trial and usual care may not be close. The point of PRE-
CIS-2 is not to always to produce a predominantly prag-
matic design (close match between trial and usual care)
but to make trialists think about the aim of their trial
and decide whether the design is appropriate given the
aim of their trial.
In pragmatic trials the comparator is usual care. In
explanatory trials it may not be. In PRECIS-2 the
domains are based on the assumption that the trial is
two armed, one of which is usual care with no changes.
If usual care is not the comparator, or there are multiple
intervention arms that are very different from each
other, then the arms will need to be scored separately;
there may be differences in Organisation and Flexibility
(delivery) and Flexibility (adherence).
The nine PRECIS-2 domains are:
1. 
Eligibility—To what extent are the participants in the
trial similar to those who would receive this interven-
tion if it was part of usual care?
2.
 Recruitment—How much extra effort is made to
recruit participants over and above what would be
used in the usual care setting to engage with patients?
3. 
Setting—How different are the settings of the trial
from the usual care setting?
4. Organisation—How different are the resources, pro-
vider expertise, and the organisation of care delivery
in the intervention arm of the trial from those avail-
able in usual care?
5.
 Flexibility (delivery)—How different is the flexibility
in how the intervention is delivered and the flexibility
anticipated in usual care?
6. 
Flexibility (adherence)—How different is the flexibil-
ity in how participants are monitored and encour-
aged to adhere to the intervention from the flexibility
anticipated in usual care?
7. Follow-up—How different is the intensity of measure-
ment and follow-up of participants in the trial from
the typical follow-up in usual care?
8. Primary outcome—To what extent is the trial’s pri-
mary outcome directly relevant to participants?
9.
 Primary analysis—To what extent are all data
included in the analysis of the primary outcome?
the domains in detail
1. Eligibility criteria—Who is selected to participate
in the trial?
A highly pragmatic approach to eligibility criteria
would be to include in the trial anyone with the condi-
tion of interest who is likely to be a candidate for the
intervention if it was being provided in usual care for
this condition. So, if in usual care the intervention
would likely be used for children, elderly people, peo-
ple with a range of comorbidities, and people with a
probable diagnosis rather than, say, a laboratory con-
firmed diagnosis, then all of these groups should be in
the trial too. If people aged over 80 or with multiple
morbidities would not receive the intervention in usual
care because we already know that this intervention
does more harm than good in elderly or multi-morbid
patients, then a pragmatic design choice would be to
exclude them from the trial. A trial with eligibility
design choices like this would score at or close to 5 on
the PRECIS-2 scale.
As the level of similarity between the people in the
trial and those in usual care decreases, then so would
the PRECIS-2 score. Many things could reduce the score,
but some examples include
• Excluding people not known or shown to be highly
adherent to the intervention.
• Excluding people using tests or measures that are not
used or available in usual care.
• Excluding people not expected to be highly respon-
sive to the intervention.
• Excluding people who would be likely to receive the
intervention in usual care but inclusion in the trial is
considered too difficult because of challenges unre-
lated to the delivery of the intervention. Children,
people over the age of 65, and pregnant women are
good examples of people commonly excluded
because of anticipated difficulties of gaining ethical
approval rather than whether they would be likely to
receive an intervention in usual care.
• Excluding people whose adherence and follow-up
may pose difficulties, whether because of social dis-
advantage, personal circumstances, or illness (such
as homelessness, substance misuse, mental health
problems, or poor motivation).
• Excluding people dependent on help for activities of
daily living, unless they would usually not be eligible
for intervention.
Trialists may make their trials less like usual care by
having tight inclusion criteria and broad exclusion
Eligibility criteria, example 1: Early treatment with
prednisolone or acyclovir in Bell’s palsy*
• Inclusion criteria—Patients with confirmed diagnosis:
≥16 years of age with unilateral facial nerve weakness
of no identifiable cause who presented to primary
care or an emergency department and could be
referred to a collaborating otorhinolaryngologist &lt;72
hours after the onset of symptoms.
• Exclusion criteria—Pregnancy, breast feeding,
uncontrolled diabetes, peptic ulcer disease,
suppurative otitis media, herpes zoster, multiple
sclerosis, systematic infection, sarcoidosis and other
rare conditions, and an inability to provide informed
consent.
• Extra test—Randomised controlled trial of Bell’s palsy
treatment required senior otorhinolaryngologist in
hospitals to confirm a patient’s eligibility to
participate. Bell’s palsy is usually diagnosed by a
general practitioner in primary care.
• Suggested PRECIS score—2, rather explanatory.

criteria. For trialists taking an explanatory approach
this is often appropriate, but this is unlikely to be the
case for trialists aiming to design a trial that is directly
applicable in a particular usual care setting, let alone
one intended to have wide generalisability across mul-
tiple care settings. Under certain circumstances, a trial
design may be pragmatic (and the results highly appli-
cable to the usual care of the participants under study)
even with narrow eligibility criteria if the particular
narrow criteria are similar to those routinely used for
those participants in their usual care setting. Some
rare disease trials may fall into this category. Trials in
myotonic dystrophy type 1, for example, may require a
genetic confirmation of the diagnosis, but since most
patients with myotonic dystrophy type 1 receive their
diagnosis through genetic confirmation this inclusion
criterion simply reflects what is usual practice. Finally,
exclusion criteria for known safety issues would not
generally reduce the PRECIS-2 score since such indi-
viduals would not be expected to get the intervention
in usual care.
2. Recruitment—How are participants recruited into
the trial?
This domain has been included to encourage trialists to
consider how and where they will recruit people to their
trial. (For clarity, we have described only trials involv-
ing patients, but, as stated above, participants could be
groups of practitioners or health system where the goal
is to improve some aspect of care at the intervention
unit of clinics, wards, hospitals, or geographic area.)
The most extreme pragmatic approach to recruitment
would be to do this in usual care so that only the people
who attend a clinic with the condition of interest are
recruited after they present on their own behalf without
any overt recruitment effort. A highly pragmatic
approach to trial design would also recruit from more
than one clinic as an explicit way of increasing applica-
bility of the trial results. Recruiting through usual
appointments at a diverse range of clinics is likely to
score at or close to 5 on the PRECIS-2 scale.
If the above is not feasible, at least as the sole recruit-
ment route, trialists will need to add other recruitment
strategies. If extra resources will be required to recruit
people to the trial, trialists need to consider if this
affects applicability, especially if participants are
recruited from settings other than the one in which the
results are likely to be applied. For example, recruiting
in secondary care for an intervention that will mainly
be used in primary care will ensure that the recruited
patients are different in severity and treatment than the
patients with this same condition in primary care; and
so this will make the trial more explanatory and reduce
the PRECIS 2 score. Additional recruitment approaches
that could potentially reduce the PRECIS-2 score
include
• Searching medical record systems for eligible partic-
ipants and then mailing invitation letters. Depending
on local resources, such as electronic medical records
and comprehensive local disease registers, this
approach may be easily achievable in usual care and
so would not reduce the PRECIS-2 score.
• Media advertising campaigns such as television
and radio advertisements, newspaper advertise-
ments, flyers, websites, press releases, letters to the
editor, interviews with the chief investigator on
television or radio. The issue to consider here is
whether these campaigns are being used simply to
speed up recruitment, or because they are the only
way to reach a dispersed population. In the latter
case, if such campaigns would not be available in
usual care then this trial recruitment route is more
explanatory.
• Incentives such as cash payment, vouchers, travel
costs, or childcare. Some of these incentives may be
better considered as part of the intervention (for
example, a lifestyle change intervention aimed at
new mothers may only be effective because childcare
was also provided and women could therefore attend
sessions).
Eligibility criteria, example 2: Practical approach to
lung health in South Africa*
• Inclusion criteria—All patients aged ≥15 with
suspected asthma were included in the study, based
on a crude clinical diagnosis of asthma, as the
standard respiratory testing machinery was not
available in this rural setting in South Africa.
• Suggested PRECIS score—5, very pragmatic.
*Fairall LR, Zwarenstein M, Bateman ED, et al. Effect of
educational outreach to nurses on tuberculosis case
detection and primary care of respiratory illness: pragmatic
cluster randomised controlled trial. BMJ 2005;331:750-4.
Recruitment, example: Leukotriene antagonists for
asthma treatment*
• Initially extra resources were used to recruit patients
at 53 primary care practices. Patients were recruited
via a postal questionnaire to identify symptoms and
trial eligibility, not just to invite to participate. This
would push the recruitment path of this domain
towards the explanatory end. By using this method of
recruitment, which requires administration not
normally present in primary care, it is possible that
responders may be healthier than those at the clinic
being invited to the trial and also more highly
motivated and compliant as they have come through
a different route than those invited during a clinic
attendance.
• In this trial, recruitment was inadequate using a
postal questionnaire, so participants were then
recruited through clinic attendances changing the
recruitment towards a more pragmatic trial design,
creating results which are more applicable to users of
the results in a primary care setting.
• Suggested PRECIS score—2, rather explanatory; but,
as trial continued, a PRECIS score of 3 (equally
pragmatic and explanatory) since trial now more a
mix of recruitment methods, some of which are
feasible in usual care.

3. Setting—Where is the trial being done?
This domain has been included to encourage trialists to
explicitly consider the match between the setting of
their trial and the setting where their results are likely to
be applied. While there are no accepted guidelines for
how to assess the impact of setting on applicability, 
5
there are several characteristics of the setting that will
almost always need to be considered, including geogra-
phy, healthcare system, country, and the socioeco-
nomic and ethnic mix of the population. 
4 14 15 
All of
these might affect the applicability of results from a
particular trial.
The most extremely pragmatic approach to setting
would be to do the trial in an identical setting to which
you intend the results to be applied. Such a trial is likely
to score at or close to 5 on PRECIS-2.
Even settings that seem rather restrictive could still
be a highly pragmatic design choice if this setting is the
usual care setting where patients are treated for the par-
ticular health condition. For example, if a trial was car-
ried out in the most specialist intensive care units in the
country and the intention of the trial was to support
decision making in these highly specialised units, then
the design choice with regard to setting is still prag-
matic. Conversely, if the trial results were intended to be
useful for all intensive care units, but the trial included
only highly specialised units, then the trial is now tak-
ing a more explanatory approach to the choice of set-
ting that goes against the intention of the trial.
Determining how pragmatic or explanatory a setting
is can be problematic when there is a proposed change
in the setting for care delivery. For instance, if a trial is
carried out in secondary care and the intention is that,
if the change in setting is successful, all future care will
be delivered in this setting, then this new setting will be
become the usual care setting. In this case the setting
domain in the trial would be explanatory compared
with current usual care, but trialists can note that the
difference is an explicit feature of the intervention.
Approaches to setting that are likely to reduce the
PRECIS-2 score include
• Selecting participating centres from among only spe-
cialist or academic centres when the trial is intended
to be applicable to all types of practice or clinic treat-
ing the condition of interest.
• Running the trial in a single centre. It is rare that a
trial is done with the intention that its results should
apply to only that single centre. Including several
centres makes it easier to claim that the trial setting
matches that to which the results will be applied.
Trialists working on trials that cross jurisdictions (such
as international trials) need to use their judgment with
regard to the impact these different settings have on the
overall trial applicability. If the trial is delivered in the
same setting as usual care in each jurisdiction then the
trial is likely to score as pragmatic on PRECIS-2, even if
the settings are different in each jurisdiction. In this
case, the trial randomisation would be stratified by
jurisdiction.
4. Organisation—What expertise and resources are
needed to deliver the intervention?
This domain has been included to encourage trialists to
consider the match between how care is organised and
delivered in the trial and how the intervention would be
made available to patients in usual care. As there have
been acknowledged difficulties in implementing results
post-trial (even in settings where the trial was con-
ducted
16
), we wanted trialists to consider organising the
delivery of their trial intervention with an awareness of
how easy it would be to implement the intervention
post-trial .
A highly pragmatic design would aim to slot the inter-
vention into the usual organisation of care for the condi-
tion of interest, making use of no more than the existing
healthcare staff and resources in that setting. A design
like this is likely to score at or close to 5 on PRECIS-2.
Sometimes a change to how care is organised is itself
the intervention being evaluated (see, for example,
Zwarenstein et al’s trial of directly observed treatment
(DOTS) versus self-supervised treatment for tuberculo-
sis 
17 
), and the difference between the trial and usual
care is clear. In this case the organisation domain would
be explanatory compared with current usual care, but
trialists can note that the difference is an explicit fea-
ture of the intervention.
The PRECIS-2 organisation score will be reduced to
the degree trialists make changes in how care is deliv-
ered compared with the usual recipients and care deliv-
ery. For example, the trial team may, in the intervention
arm, provide additional training to staff or provide
additional staff so that the intervention can be deliv-
ered. Patients who would normally be seen in primary
Setting, example 2: Ibuprofen, paracetamol, and
steam for patients with respiratory tract infections in
primary care*
• Identical setting to usual care setting: primary care,
where patients usually go for advice and treatment of
the common cold in the UK.
• Multi-centre: 25 practices in UK.
• Suggested PRECIS score—5, very pragmatic

care: pragmatic randomised factorial trial. BMJ

Setting, example 1: Manual physical therapy versus
corticosteroid injection to treat shoulder
impingement*
• Single centre and specialised centre (Madigan Army
Medical Center, USA), unlikely to be the usual setting
for most individuals receiving physiotherapy for
shoulder impingement.
• Suggested PRECIS score—2, rather explanatory,
dependent on how different raters think the
treatment centre is similar from usual setting in the
country they live in.

care may be seen by specialists in secondary care
instead, or they may receive additional expensive diag-
nostic procedures unavailable in usual care. The suc-
cess or otherwise of the trial then depends on resources
unavailable in usual care, reducing applicability. If
these additional resources are essential to the effective-
ness of the intervention they should be considered to be
part of the intervention and be specified in the part of
the protocol describing the intervention. In that case
these resources should not be counted when this ele-
ment of the trial is judged.
Organisational approaches that are likely to reduce
the PRECIS-2 score include the following (but only
when they are not incorporated and described as neces-
sary elements of the intervention):
• Increasing the number of healthcare or other profes-
sionals available to deliver the intervention over and
above the levels available in usual care.
• Providing significant levels of additional training to
increase the expertise of healthcare professionals.
• Requiring healthcare professionals to have some
minimum level of experience, defined by length of
time, in working with the intervention that is greater
than would be the case in usual care.
• Requiring healthcare professionals to have a spe-
cialty certification that would not be considered
essential to deliver the intervention in usual care.
• Increasing the resources (such as facilities, diag-
nostic equipment, consumables) available to
deliver the intervention, measure outcomes, or do
follow-up over and above what would be available
in usual care.
5. Flexibility (delivery)—How should the intervention
be delivered?
In PRECIS-2, trialists wishing to conduct more pragmatic
trials are encouraged to think about how the interven-
tion will be implemented post-trial in the setting where
the results are expected to be applied. The most prag-
matic design approach to delivery flexibility would leave
the details of how to implement the intervention up to
providers, in other words, what happens in usual care.
Thus, the methodology of how to deliver an intervention
is not rigidly prescriptive in the protocol. For example,
the details of how to perform a surgical procedure could
be left entirely to the surgeon, or how to deliver an edu-
cational programme is left to the discretion of the educa-
tor. Additionally, a pragmatic approach would not
dictate which other interventions were permitted, or
how to deliver them, which again is the situation in
usual practice. This sort of delivery flexibility would
score at or close to 5 on PRECIS-2. Flexibility (delivery)
applies to all intervention arms and the comparator
(control) arm if usual care is not the comparator, and if
necessary each of these arms will need to be scored sep-
arately. If usual care is the intended comparator but any
elements relating to delivery are changed it ceases to be
usual care and needs to be scored.
As delivery flexibility is reduced, the trial moves
towards a more explanatory approach in this domain.
Approaches to delivery flexibility that are likely to
reduce the PRECIS-2 score include
• A highly specified, protocol driven intervention. For
example, specific direction is given for how to the
administer the intervention (such as dose, dosing
schedule, surgical procedures, educational material,
and delivery)
• Having measures in place to monitor the compliance
of those delivering the intervention (such as doctors)
Organisation, example 1: Establishment of Acute
Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) Network in
1994*
• Multicentre clinical trials of ARDS treatments, but
there was difficulty translating results from a trial
involving low tidal volume (Vt) into usual clinical
practice
• Ten academic centres with 75 intensive care units
• Extra staff, and very labour intensive
• Used additional equipment beyond usual care, none
of which was planned for at the trial design stage
• Suggested PRECIS score—1, very explanatory

Syndrome Network. N Engl J Med 2000;342:1301-8.
Organisation, example 2: Early lens extraction and
intraocular lens implantation to treat glaucoma*
• Identical organisation to usual care, usual clinic
• Same number of staff
• Usual experience—fully qualified ophthalmologists
who have completed general and specialist training
(in ophthalmology and glaucoma, respectively) and
able to perform lens extraction procedures
• No additional training
• No additional resources
• Suggested PRECIS score—5, very pragmatic

implantation for the treatment of primary angle-closure

Flexibility (delivery), example 1: Cognitive
behavioural therapy (CBT) for depression*
• Measures in place to monitor and improve
compliance: In this trial therapy was delivered by
selected experts who received regular training and
supervision (but were independently assessed as
representative of NHS staff). There was also
independent assessment to confirm minimum
standard of delivery of CBT but no measures in place
to improve compliance as this was self regulated by
therapists.
• No specific protocol for timing or co-interventions
• Suggested PRECIS score—5, very pragmatic

with the protocol and measures (up to and including
exclusion) to address poor compliance.
• The timing of intervention delivery is tightly defined
and designed to maximise the intervention effect.
• Providers undertake additional interventions that
would not occur in usual care
• Restrictions are placed on the number and types of
co-interventions, particularly if excluded co-inter-
ventions would dilute any intervention effect
• There is specific direction for applying permitted
co-interventions
• There are specific directions for managing complica-
tions or side effects of the intervention.
6. Flexibility (adherence)—What measures are in
place to ensure participants adhere to the
intervention?
It is important that trialists focused on applicability con-
sider how probable it is that there will be uptake of the
intervention being tested and how recipients will engage
with it in the setting in which it will be later applied.
A highly pragmatic design approach would allow for full
flexibility in how end user recipients engage with the
intervention. In usual care, health professionals encour-
age patients to take medication or follow therapy as best
they can, and such encouragement would not count
against a pragmatic design; if it also happens in usual
care, allowing it in the trial is a pragmatic design deci-
sion. A trial with no special measures to enforce engage-
ment or compliance would score at or close to 5 on
PRECIS-2. On the other hand, a trial protocol that lays
out methods to monitor and ensure patient compliance
would score at or close to 1 on PRECIS-2. Flexibility
(adherence) applies to all intervention arms and the
comparator (control) arm if usual care if not the compar-
ator, and if necessary each of these arms will need to be
scored separately. If usual care is the intended compar-
ator but any elements relating to adherence are changed
it ceases to be usual care and needs to be scored.
It is possible that improving recipients’ ability to take
medication or follow therapy is the intervention under
evaluation, a situation similar to that already described for
the Setting and Organisation domains. In this case, the
Flexibility (adherence) domain would be explanatory
compared with current usual care, but trialists can note
that the difference is an explicit feature of the intervention.
As flexibility for recipients is reduced, the trial moves
towards a more explanatory approach on this domain.
Approaches to recipient flexibility that are likely to
reduce the PRECIS-2 score include
• Having a trial pre-screening stage where patients are
evaluated for adherence with the intervention (such
as dose, dosing schedule, attendance at therapy ses-
sions). Patients judged to not be adherent are
excluded.
• Withdrawing patients from the trial if their adherence
with the intervention drops below some specified
level. For example, a trial might withdraw patients if
they failed to attend two consecutive sessions of cog-
nitive behavioural therapy or failed to take more than
90% of their medication.
• Having measures in place to monitor patient adher-
ence with the protocol and measures (up to and
including withdrawal) to address poor adherence.
Measures to increase patient adherence should this
fall below some specified level could, for example,
include scheduling an extra discussion with a
research nurse about why following the trial instruc-
tions is important.
In some trials—such as surgical trials where patients
are being operated on or intensive care unit trials where
patients are being given intravenous drugs—this
domain is not applicable as there is no adherence issue
after consent has been given, so we suggest that the
PRECIS-2 score should be left blank.
7. Follow-up—How closely are participants
followed up?
This domain encourages trialists to think about fol-
low-up with regard to the setting where the results will be
applied. The most pragmatic position with regard to fol-
low-up would be to have no more follow-up of recipients
than would be the case in usual care. Indeed, the most
extreme position is to have no follow-up contact at all
with recipients and to obtain outcome data by other
means (such as electronic medical records or other usual
data to measure mortality or hospital admissions). Trials
that have no more follow-up than is normal in usual care
and have minimal additional data collection (or use data
obtained from administrative or clinical record systems
without direct contact with the participant) would be
likely to score at or close to 5 on PRECIS-2.
Flexibility (delivery), example 2: Elective caesarean
section syntocinon infusion trial*
• Protocol driven—Much detail given, with protocol
violations recorded in self reported case form.
Investigators accept this may occur due to clinical
needs (such as anaesthesia).
• Co-interventions—Specific direction
• Complications—Specific directions for managing
complications or side effects
• Improving adherence—No measures in place
• Suggested PRECIS score—2, rather explanatory

Flexibility (adherence), example: Music therapy to
support communication in autistic children*
• The sessions were all individual based on interaction
with child and allowed for range of responses to the
intervention

As follow-up becomes more intense, the trial
becomes more explanatory and the PRECIS-2 score will
decrease. Follow-up approaches that are likely to
reduce the PRECIS-2 score include
• Follow-up visits that are more frequent than would
typically occur under usual care.
• Unscheduled follow-up visits are triggered by a pri-
mary outcome event.
• Unscheduled follow-up visits are triggered by an
intervening event that is likely to lead to the primary
outcome event.
• Patients are contacted if they fail to keep trial
appointments. This would not reduce the PRECIS-2
score if this was also done in usual care.
• More extensive data are collected, particularly interven-
tion related data, than would be typical outside the trial.
• Visits are longer than usual care and involve addi-
tional or different staff.
Often the required trial outcomes may be obtained only
through contact with the recipients. Even in the “no fol-
low-up” approach, assessment of outcomes may be
achieved with a single follow-up at the end of the study.
The end of study would need to be defined so that there
is sufficient time for the desired study outcomes (see
Primary outcome domain below) to be observed. When
the follow-up is done in this way, it is unlikely to have
an impact on engagement or response to the treatment,
and so such a follow-up approach would be viewed as
pragmatic and rated at or close to 5.
It is often the case that explanatory trials are inter-
ested in the effect of an intervention only during a brief
intervention period or shortly after. On the other hand,
trials taking a pragmatic approach to design may follow
recipients well beyond the intervention period. This
longer period of follow-up may require more contacts
than would be the case in usual care, but this need not
be inconsistent with a pragmatic approach if it does not
result in care management that differs from the usual
conditions. It is, however, important to consider the
burden of follow-up for participants.
8. Primary outcome—How relevant is it to
participants?
The choice of primary outcome is a crucial trial design
decision, and a pragmatic approach would be to select an
outcome that is of obvious importance from the patient’s
perspective. Post-trial, an outcome selected using a prag-
matic approach would also be relevant to commissioners
of care, the people who decide whether to implement the
intervention on the basis of its results. For example, an
intervention that aims to reduce falls in elderly people
living independently in the community should have as its
primary outcome the number of falls in the elderly living
independently in the community. This outcome has
meaning to patients, their relatives and friends, health-
care professionals, and policymakers. Measures of, say,
bone density, muscle strength, or functional ability are
distant from the key question of whether the intervention
prevents elderly people falling in their own homes. Trials
that choose outcomes of obvious importance to patients,
and measure them in a way that is the same or similar to
the way they are measured in usual care would be likely
to score at or close to 5 on PRECIS-2.
As the primary outcome becomes less recognisably
important to patients, or is assessed on criteria seldom
used in usual care, the trial becomes more explanatory
and the PRECIS-2 score will decrease. Approaches to the
primary outcomes that are likely to reduce the PRECIS-2
score include
• Choosing a surrogate outcome (such as blood test)
that the intervention is expected to have a direct
Follow-up, example 2: Self management course for
chronic musculoskeletal pain*
• Participants followed up two times over a year (at 6
and 12 months)—not intense. This is quite close to
usual care for pain related disability.
• Follow-up for the primary outcome requires self
completion of a postal validated questionnaire
chronic pain grade, which contains three questions
to determine the primary outcome “pain related
disability” (and secondary outcome “pain
intensity”).
• No additional follow up visits—All additional data
collection for secondary outcomes use six additional
short postal questionnaires sent at 6 and 12 months:
EQ-5D (health utility), Pain Self-Efficacy
Questionnaire, Hospital Anxiety and Depression
Scale (mood), Chronic Pain Acceptance
Questionnaire (coping), Health Education Impact
Questionnaire (social integration subscale), Census
global health question (general health).
• Additional data from GP electronic records
• Suggested PRECIS score—4, rather pragmatic

cost-effectiveness of a novel, group self-management course

for a multicentre, randomised controlled trial (COPERS). BMJ
Open 2013;3:e002492.
Follow-up, example 1: Perioperative β blockade for
patients undergoing infrarenal vascular surgery*
• Clinical follow-up until patient left hospital
(discharge or death) or until 30 days after surgery,
whichever was the longer, so more than usual care.
• Monitoring intensity involved more extensive data
collection than usual:
Pre-operation—three-lead electrocardiogram (ECG)
Holter monitor (Flashcard with 2×48 hour
recording) set up on each patient and maintained
for 72 hours.
Troponin values at 1, 3, and 7 days after surgery
(more usual for only 1 and 3 days after surgery)
ECG after randomisation and at 7 and 30 days after
surgery.
• Unscheduled follow-up visits triggered by primary
outcome: a cardiovascular event (such as angina,
myocardial infarction, stroke)
• Suggested PRECIS score—1, very explanatory

effect on, or the use of safety climate surveys rather
than medical error events or near miss events.
• Using a composite primary outcome in which some of
the elements are less important to patients or partici-
pants than others (such as incidence of death, stroke,
myocardial infarction, or renal dysfunction at 30 days).
• Having central adjudication of the outcome or using
an assessment that needs special training or tests not
normally used in usual care.
• Choosing an outcome that is important but mainly to
providers, typically because it is a physiological out-
come considered useful in treatment planning and
monitoring.
• Measuring an outcome that is important but at a time
that is earlier than would be normal in usual care. For
example, stroke could be a primary outcome in trials
making explanatory or pragmatic design choices.
However, time horizons may vary from short term
after a one-time intervention (more explanatory) to
long term (more pragmatic).
9. Primary analysis—To what extent are all data
included?
Most trials are a superiority design so the most prag-
matic approach with regard to the analysis would be to
make no special allowance in the analysis for non-ad-
herence, practice variability, etc. In other words, the
pragmatic approach to the analysis would typically be
an intention-to-treat analysis using all available data.
This sort of analysis would score at or close to 5 on PRE-
CIS-2. (Non-inferiority and equivalence trials are usu-
ally contrary to intention-to-treat analysis.)
The intention-to-treat analysis has recently also
become the norm for superiority trials taking a more
explanatory design approach, especially when regula-
tory approval for an intervention is being sought. The
most explanatory approach would be to use the “as
treated analysis” as the primary analysis, in which only
those patients who actually received (or did not receive)
the intervention would be analysed in the intervention
and control groups respectively, irrespective of their ini-
tial randomised group allocation.
Other causes of missing data may be important but may
not affect how pragmatic or explanatory a trial is. System-
atic exclusion of data from participants because, say, they
were poorly adherent would make a trial more explana-
tory. Using all data but doing nothing to try and fill gaps
caused by missing data would not in itself make trial
more pragmatic or explanatory; missing data, especially
if there is a lot of it, makes any conclusions more uncer-
tain regardless of the design approach taken. As Vickers
and Altman state, “analysis of missing data teaches us
the importance of avoiding missing data in the first place:
an informed guess, even using a technique as sophisti-
cated as multiple imputation, is still a guess.”
18
Approaches to the primary analysis that are likely to
reduce the PRECIS-2 score include
• Excluding non-compliant recipients (per protocol
analysis)
• Analyse recipients to treatment received instead of
treatment randomised (as treated analysis)
• Excluding data from non-adherent providers
• Excluding data from trial sites or providers who
recruit below expected volume.
For some trials taking an explanatory approach (dose
finding trials are an example), it may be appropriate to
have primary analysis restricted in the ways mentioned;
otherwise such restricted analyses of the primary out-
come could be pre-planned as secondary analyses of
the primary outcome.
Conclusion
PRECIS-2 has been developed through extensive interna-
tional consultation with trialists, and we believe it will
help trialists (new and experienced) ensure that they
Primary outcome, example: Early treatment with
prednisolone or acyclovir in Bell’s palsy*
• Primary outcome—Recovery of facial function as
rated on the House-Brackmann scale.
• Test not routinely used in primary care and requires
training. It is, however, an easy clinical test widely
used in secondary care for grading recovery from
facial nerve paralysis caused by damage to lower
motor neurons.
• Central adjudication—Photographs taken of patients
were assessed and graded independently by a panel
of three experts (not general practitioners, who
usually assess).
• Suggested PRECIS score—1, very explanatory

match their design decisions to the needs of those they
intend to use the results of the trial. It makes trial teams
explicitly aware of the range of opinions within the team
and facilitates discussion and eventual consensus. The
tool aims to assist in obtaining consistency in decision
making, meaning decisions made on each domain of
PRECIS-2 should broadly be in keeping with each other. It
does not remove the need for judgment because there is
no single “correct” answer to be discovered. The advan-
tage of PRECIS-2 is that it makes these judgments explicit
and therefore able to be discussed by the trial team.
PRECIS-2 could be a tool in a multifaceted package to
help trialists design trials that meet the users’ needs.
For instance, in the US, the NIH Clinical and Transla-
tional Science Awards (CTSA) Consortium does not con-
duct trials but facilitates their conduct and
implementation, and PRECIS-2 could used as part of
those activities.
19 
Trials units and other centres of trial
expertise could work through the PRECIS-2 wheel with
investigators to ensure that trial design decisions are
consistent with the investigators’ intended purpose.
The tool could also be a way of promoting trials that effi-
ciently assist in the continued development of evidence
based care.
 
20 
It would thus continue to promote and
re-energise Archie Cochrane’s vision of efficient effec-
tive healthcare by addressing the issue of applicability
and extrapolating trial results into real life.
21
There is a substantial degree of waste in medical
research (see http://researchwaste.net). Some of this
waste is due to trials providing results that are irrele-
vant to the healthcare decisions of those for whom the
trial was intended to help.
 
4-6 
We believe PRECIS-2 can
help to reduce this waste by raising awareness of the
need to explicitly consider the match between design
decisions (and the consequences of these) and the use-
fulness of the future results to the intended audience.
As Dave Sackett has pointed out, the applicability of the
results of a trial can never be assured,
22 
because of the
complexity of patients, health professionals, clinical
settings, cultures, and healthcare systems. But using
PRECIS-2 to consider applicability at the design stage
will make it more likely that the results of a trial are
more useful to their intended users than they otherwise
would have been.
As in the original PRECIS tool, the authors welcome
feedback on PRECIS-2 to continue the quest to design
trials fit for purpose.

How to use PRECIS-2 - Designing trials that are fit for purpose
We think there are four steps to using PRECIS-2, which may be iterative depending on what you
discover after going through the steps.
Step 1: Why are you doing your trial?
Your first step is to be clear about why you are doing your trial. Are you:
1. Aiming to take an explanatory approach to answer the question ‘Can this
intervention work under ideal conditions?’
2. Aiming to take a pragmatic approach and answer the question ‘Does this
intervention work under usual conditions?’
Both approaches to trial design have their place but trialists should be clear which path they are on.
As Schwartz and Lellouch pointed out, trialists have often taken the first approach by default rather
than as a considered judgement.
Step 2: Consider your trial design choices for each of the nine PRECIS-2 domains
This step is explained in more detail for each domain later on.
Step 3: Score 1 to 5 for these choices made in Step 2 and/or mark on the PRECIS-2 wheel
Having considered your design choices in Step 2, the PRECIS-2 wheel is used to record how
pragmatic or explanatory these choices are for each domain. Each domain is a 5-point Likert scale:
1. Very explanatory
2. Rather explanatory
3. Equally pragmatic/explanatory
4. Rather pragmatic
5. Very pragmatic
A table can be used in conjunction with the PRECIS “wheel” or instead of the wheel to give rationale
for scores. You can use this to assist discussion with trial collaborators.
Step 4: Review your PRECIS-2 wheel
Review your design choices (Step 2) on the PRECIS-2 wheel to see whether they will produce a trial
that will support the aim identified in Step 1. Go back to Step 2 and modify your design choices if
required.

The PRECIS-2 Domains
The NINE PRECIS-2 domains are:
 Eligibility –to what extent are the participants in the trial similar to those who would receive this
intervention if it was part of usual care? For example, score 5 for very pragmatic criteria
essentially identical to those in usual care; score 1 for a very explanatory approach with lots of
exclusions (e.g. those who don’t comply, respond to treatment, or are not at high risk for
primary outcome, are children or elderly), or uses many selection tests not used in usual care.
 Recruitment - how much extra effort is made to recruit participants over and above what that
would be used in the usual care setting to engage with patients? For example, score 5 for very
pragmatic recruitment through usual appointments or clinic; score 1 for a very explanatory
approach with targeted invitation letters, advertising in newspapers, radio plus incentives and
other routes that would not be used in usual care.
 Setting – how different is the setting of the trial and the usual care setting? For example, score 5
for a very pragmatic choice using identical settings to usual care; score 1, for a very explanatory
approach with only a single centre, or only specialised trial or academic centres.
 Organisation – how different are the resources, provider expertise and the organisation of care
delivery in the intervention arm of the trial and those available in usual care? For example, score
5 for a very pragmatic choice that uses identical organisation to usual care; score 1 for a very
explanatory approach if the trial increases staff levels, gives additional training, require more
than usual experience or certification and increase resources.
 Flexibility (delivery) – how different is the flexibility in how the intervention is delivered and the
flexibility likely in usual care? For example, score 5 for a very pragmatic choice with identical
flexibility to usual care; score 1 for a very explanatory approach if there is a strict protocol,
monitoring and measures to improve compliance, with specific advice on allowed co-
interventions and complications.
 Flexibility (adherence) - how different is the flexibility in how participants must adhere to the
intervention and the flexibility likely in usual care? For example, score 5 for a very pragmatic
choice involving no more than usual encouragement to adhere to the intervention; score 1 for a
very explanatory approach that involves exclusion based on adherence, and measures to
improve adherence if found wanting. In some trials eg surgical trials where patients are being
operated on or Intensive Care Unit trials where patients are being given IV drug therapy, this
domain is not applicable as there is no compliance issue after consent has been given, so this
score should be left blank.
 Follow-up - how different is the intensity of measurement and follow-up of participants in the
trial and the likely follow-up in usual care? For example, score 5 for a very pragmatic approach
with no more than usual follow up; score 1 for a very explanatory approach with more frequent,
longer visits, unscheduled visits triggered by primary outcome event or intervening event, and
more extensive data collection.
 Primary outcome – to what extent is the trial's primary outcome relevant to participants? For
example, score 5 for a very pragmatic choice where the outcome is of obvious importance to
participants; score 1 for a very explanatory approach using a surrogate, physiological outcome,
central adjudication or use assessment expertise that is not available in usual care, or the
outcome is measured at an earlier time than in usual care.
 Primary analysis – to what extent are all data included in the analysis of the primary outcome?
For example, score 5 for a very pragmatic approach using intention to treat with all available
data; score 1 for a very explanatory analysis that excludes ineligible post-randomisation
participants, includes only completers or those following the treatment protocol.

5/8
Notes
“Participants" include patients or other individual recipients of an intervention, and/or providers of
the intervention. This may include individual participants and/or one or more levels of clusters. For
example, in a trial of a continuing education intervention, participants may be health professionals
and trained instructors and the trial may be randomised into clusters at the level of the instructor.
During the design process, if there is uncertainty over how explanatory or pragmatic a domain is,
then we suggest the score for this domain should be left blank. This will then highlight uncertainty
and encourage discussion. If PRECIS-2 is used to look at how pragmatic included trials are in
systematic reviews then a score of 3 may be chosen if there is inadequate information. This is
different to the “3 = equally pragmatic/explanatory”.

Table – PRECIS-2 scores for trial domains
Domain Score Rationale
1 Eligibility Criteria 5 
Patients ≥ 3 with acute respiratory tract infections. Exclusions not common cold but severe respiratory tract infections,
peptic ulcer and asthma. But even asthma patients who were not sensitive to ibuprofen or aspirin eligible. Pregnant or
breast feeding women are discouraged from taking ibuprofen when pregnant but can take as low a dose as possible of
Paracetemol but as both being tested in the trial cannot include this group as participants. If include visually impaired
increase organisation of trial (as in carers have to assist diary completion) but that would be norm and usual if
prescribed ibuprofen or Paracetemol or steam treatment in usual care, so just easier for trialists to exclude. Small
proportion of participants – so why exclude? Depressed and people with psychosis unreliable diary fillers, concerned
with other things.
2 Recruitment Path 5 
Patients presenting to GP or nurse in primary care with respiratory tract infections as diagnosed by health professional.
Easy to recruit to but time pressures in busy winter clinics prevented recruitment and meant non-recruitments logs
poorly completed.
3 Setting 5 Identical setting to usual care setting - primary care where patients usually go for advice and treatment.
4 
Organisation
intervention
3 
Information sheets given out to participants. This is not usual practice, would it be if trial had shown this helped? Need
more staff for follow up of trial participants to get diary results so more extensive data collection than usual. Otherwise
no difference in provider expertise and organisation of care delivery.

Compliance measured with diary – “reasonably good” participants free to “not-comply” with advice. Little impact of
advising patients to take analgesics regularly. No measures to improve compliance
7 Follow up 2 Participants Followed up one month – usual care no follow up. Patients come back to GP if problems.
Trial more extensive data colleaction - patients telephoned day two to three to check for any problems with diary
completion. If no diary after 2 weeks then mailed reminder and then phoned as necessary to document outcomes using
validated questionnaire.
8 Outcome 5 
Very relevant to participants - Mean symptom severity on days 2-4. Symptoms 0 (no problem) to 6 (as bad as they can
be 7 in abstract). Completed in diary at end of day – children with parents or participants.
