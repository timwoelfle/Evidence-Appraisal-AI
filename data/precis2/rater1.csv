different exercises for one minute each, having a rest before moving to the next exercise. Not

added to some of the exercises to encourage progress Instruction cards, with photographs,
demonstrating the four different levels of skill/difficulty were used at both sites. Subjects
were provided with exercise progress cards and they were asked to record which level they
performed each exercise at each session. Attendance of subjects as each class was recorded.

Subjects assigned to the control group were advised to continue their usual routine, seeking
any healthcare as required. They were asked to avoid beginning any new exercise regime for
the twelve weeks of the study.

The intervention took place at two different geographical locations (Site A & Site B). From
those living near Site A a list of potential participants (n=16) was created and to maximise
class occupancy, ten potential participants were to be allocated to Site A?s intervention group.
A computer programme (Microsoft Excel 2003) was set-up to randomly assign the ten places
against ten of the 16 subjects, leaving six subjects in the control group. A similar system was
used for Site B, (which had a class capacity of 12), for which a list of potential participants

One session included up to three patients and lasted 120 min, five days/week for two weeks. After the supervised two weeks (Phase 1), a tailored home-based TOCT program was delivered to subjects so that they can independently train for the following 12 weeks (Phase 2). The investigators provided an illustrated brochure and the training material (i.e. stepper, stop-watch, small obstacles).
At home, we recommended 60-minute sessions three times/week. The home-based program includes overground walking practice and exercises with similar modalities and difficulty as learnt during Phase 1. Patients recorded the frequency and duration of the training in a precompiled logbook. Patients were given the contact number of the hospital to contact if they needed it. Home-based adherence was monitored using a Visual Analog Scale during each monthly visit.

Inclusion criteria
1. Providing written informed consent.

2. Over the age of 18.

3. Clinical diagnosis of relapsing-remitting or progressive multiple sclerosis (Poser/McDonald criteria [48-50].

4. Score on the Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS) [51] greater than 4. The FSS is a uni-dimensional self-report measure consisting of 9 items that ask about severity of fatigue related to daily activities (such as physical functioning, exercise, work, family, and social life). Responses are made on a 7-point Likert-type scale.

5. Ambulatory (score on the Adapted Patient Determined Disease Steps (APDDS) Scale [52] < 8). This self-administered instrument is based on the Patient-Determined Disease Steps (PDDS) scale and the telephone Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS). The programme content will be most relevant for those who are ambulatory. Individuals who are non-ambulatory will continue to receive standard care.

6. Able to attend the intervention sessions.

7. English speaking.

Exclusion criteria
1. Attended a specific fatigue management programme within the last year.

2. Received a substantive, specific, fatigue intervention from an Occupational Therapist (OT) or other health professional, consisting of more than general advice, within the previous 3 months (such as the guidance produced by the National Association of Neurological Occupational Therapists (NANOT) [53] (now known as the College of Occupational Therapists Specialist Section - Neurological Practice) [29].

3. Already involved in another research study.

4. Individuals who have cognitive deficits such that they would not be able to engage in the group format or benefit from the programme. If individuals have substantial cognitive deficits much of the content of the fatigue management programme would not be appropriate. This will be based on the judgement of health professionals/local investigators.

5. Individuals who have had a relapse within the previous three months. This would be a potential confound since a change in fatigue could be the result of treatment or improvement after a recent relapse.

6. Individuals who have been on a disease-modifying drug (such as Beta-Interferon, Glatiramer Acetate) or an anti-depressant for fewer than 3 months. One of the possible initial side effects of these drugs is fatigue and thus this could be a confounder.

7. Individuals who are known to be currently under the care of a psychiatrist or under the care of addiction services will be excluded. Ongoing psychiatric disorders or addiction problems would compromise the potential to benefit from the programme.

Individuals excluded from the research project will continue to be seen as per usual care.","4","Participants were recruited in three UK centres (Poole, Bristol, Southampton/Portsmouth) from primary or secondary care, or via MS Society newsletters/websites.","4","Participants were recruited in three UK centres (Poole, Bristol, Southampton/Portsmouth) from primary or secondary care, or via MS Society newsletters/websites.
