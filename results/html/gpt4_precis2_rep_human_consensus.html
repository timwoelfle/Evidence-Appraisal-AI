quote(s) from the LLM prompt briefing</span> (mean similarity 100%) -

<pre>
1. Eligibility criteria

Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Patients with type 2 diabetes (n=264) selected by a self-administered questionnaire aimed at measuring emotional distress and diabetes-related reduced daily functioning.&quot;</span>
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Patients with score DFT >4 and DS >3 were eligible for trial participation.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial included patients with type 2 diabetes who were experiencing emotional distress and reduced daily functioning due to their condition. This suggests a somewhat pragmatic approach as it includes a subset of patients who are likely to be seen in usual care. However, the use of specific measures (DFT and DS scores) to determine eligibility may not be typical in usual care, suggesting some level of explanatory design.

Score: [3]

2. Recruitment

Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Patients were asked to return the completed questionnaire to the research centre and to give informed consent to be approached if they were found to be eligible for research follow-up measurements.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The recruitment process involved patients completing a questionnaire and giving informed consent to be approached for research follow-up. This is not a typical recruitment process in usual care, suggesting a more explanatory approach.

Score: [2]

3. Setting

Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;A regional care group in the Netherlands consisting of 77 family practices.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial was conducted in a regional care group consisting of multiple family practices, which is a typical setting for diabetes care. This suggests a pragmatic approach.

Score: [5]

4. Organisation

Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Practice nurses in the intervention arm (n=19) were trained to integrate SMS into their routine consultations.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial involved training practice nurses to integrate the intervention into their routine consultations. This suggests a somewhat pragmatic approach as it involves using existing healthcare staff. However, the need for additional training may not be typical in usual care, suggesting some level of explanatory design.

Score: [3]

5. Flexibility (delivery)

Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Practice nurses in the intervention arm (n=19) were trained to integrate SMS into their routine consultations.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The intervention was delivered by practice nurses during routine consultations, suggesting a pragmatic approach. However, the need for specific training to deliver the intervention may suggest some level of explanatory design.

Score: [3]

6. Flexibility (adherence)

Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;A trial with no special measures to enforce engagement or compliance would score at or close to 5 on PRECIS-2.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The full text does not provide specific information about measures to ensure participants adhere to the intervention.

Score: [NA]

7. Follow-up

Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Outcomes were measured at baseline and at 4-month and 12-month follow-ups.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial involved follow-up measurements at 4 months and 12 months, which may not be typical in usual care, suggesting a more explanatory approach.

Score: [2]

8. Primary outcome

Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The primary outcome measure was a dichotomised score on a Visual Analogue Scale that measured the perceived effect of diabetes on daily functioning.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The primary outcome was the perceived effect of diabetes on daily functioning, which is a patient-relevant outcome. This suggests a pragmatic approach.

Score: [5]

9. Primary analysis

Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Analyses were performed on an intention-to-treat basis.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial used an intention-to-treat analysis, which includes all participants regardless of adherence or dropout, suggesting a pragmatic approach.

<pre>
1. Eligibility criteria

Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Inclusion criteria were diagnosis of PPMS or SPMS, Internet access and some level of distress determined by a score of 3 or greater on the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12).&quot;</span>
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Exclusion criteria were severe cognitive impairment, as determined by a score of 20 or smaller on the Telephone Interview for Cognitive Status-Modified (TICS-M), and high suicide risk, as assessed by a score of 20 or greater on the Clinical Outcome of Routine Evaluation (CORE-10).&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The eligibility criteria for this trial are quite specific, including a diagnosis of PPMS or SPMS, internet access, and a certain level of distress. Additionally, individuals with severe cognitive impairment or high suicide risk were excluded. These criteria may limit the generalizability of the trial results to the broader population of individuals with MS, as they exclude those without internet access or with cognitive impairments or high suicide risk.

Score: [2]

2. Recruitment

Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;We recruited 40 participants across the UK.&quot;</span>
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;We recruited potential participants through adverts on the MS Society website and from National Health Service (NHS) MS centres across the UK.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The recruitment process involved advertising on the MS Society website and through NHS MS centres, which may not reflect the usual care setting where patients are typically identified and approached for interventions. This approach may limit the generalizability of the trial results to the broader population of individuals with MS.

Score: [2]

3. Setting

Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The treatment phase took place between February 2013 and July 2013.&quot;</span>
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;We delivered the programme in eight hour-long sessions over an eight-week period via Skype video conferences.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial was conducted via Skype video conferences, which is not a typical care setting. This may limit the generalizability of the trial results to the broader population of individuals with MS, particularly those without access to or familiarity with Skype.

Score: [2]

4. Organisation

Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;AB, a health psychologist, facilitated the courses. AB was supervised by PC, a clinical psychologist and expert mindfulness practitioner.&quot;</span>
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants were sent a headset and webcam together with instructions of how to set up Skype.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial required specific resources (headset, webcam, Skype setup instructions) and expertise (health psychologist, clinical psychologist) that may not be readily available in a usual care setting. This may limit the generalizability of the trial results to the broader population of individuals with MS.

Score: [2]

5. Flexibility (delivery)

Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Each session started with a 10-minute mindfulness practice, followed by discussion of this practice and the homework practice of the previous week.&quot;</span>
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants were encouraged to keep a diary of home practice, but, in fact, very few did record it.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The intervention was delivered in a structured manner with specific activities and homework assignments. However, there was some flexibility in that participants were not strictly required to keep a diary of home practice. This suggests a balance between explanatory and pragmatic approaches.

Score: [3]

6. Flexibility (adherence)

Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Eighteen of the 19 participants completed the mindfulness intervention.&quot;</span>
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;All the participants attended four or more of the eight mindfulness sessions and 14 (73.7%) attended six or more sessions.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial allowed for some flexibility in adherence, as evidenced by the fact that not all participants attended all sessions. This suggests a more pragmatic approach.

Score: [4]

7. Follow-up

Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants completed online questionnaires at baseline (prior to randomisation), post-intervention and three-month follow-up.&quot;</span>
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;If participants had failed to complete the questionnaires a week later, SW phoned them to ensure that they had received the email and that they were not encountering any technical difficulties.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The follow-up process involved online questionnaires at specific time points, with additional contact if participants failed to complete the questionnaires. This level of follow-up is more intensive than what would typically occur in usual care.

Score: [2]

8. Primary outcome

Quotes:
- <span title='Major quote deviation, possible hallucination. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 56.6%):

distress, as measured by GHQ,' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: red'>&quot;The primary outcome was distress, as measured by GHQ.&quot;</span>
- <span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 99.2%):

Distress scores were lower in the intervention group compared with the control group at postintervention and follow-up' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;Distress scores were lower in the intervention group compared with the control group at post-intervention and follow-up.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The primary outcome of distress is relevant to participants and is measured in a way that is similar to how it would be measured in usual care. This suggests a more pragmatic approach.

Score: [4]

9. Primary analysis

Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Outcome analysis was conducted using Stata 12.1.&quot;</span>
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Treatment effects on the primary and secondary outcomes were estimated using linear mixed modelling.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The primary analysis included all available data and used statistical methods that are commonly used in clinical trials. This suggests a balance between explanatory and pragmatic approaches.

<p><i><span style="border-bottom: 1px dashed black;">7 quote(s) from
publication full text</span> (mean similarity 100%)</i></p>
<pre>
1. Eligibility criteria
- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Key inclusion criteria permitted the participation of men or women ≥18 years of age with confirmed and documented RRMS diagnosis (as defined by the Revised McDonald criteria), Kurtzke Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score of 0 to 5.5 at the screening visit, and, 30 days prior to randomization, a stable neurological condition, relapse-free status, and no use of any corticosteroid or adrenocorticotropic hormone treatment.&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The eligibility criteria for this trial are quite specific, including only patients with a confirmed diagnosis of RRMS, a specific EDSS score, and a stable neurological condition. This suggests that the trial is more explanatory in nature, as it does not include a broad range of patients who might be treated with the intervention in a real-world setting.
- Score: [2]

2. Recruitment
- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The CONFIDENCE study was a multinational, multicenter, randomized, parallel-group, phase 4, open-label study conducted at 88 study centers in 14 countries.&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The recruitment process for this trial appears to be quite extensive, involving multiple centers in various countries. However, the text does not provide specific details about how patients were recruited, such as whether they were recruited through usual care settings or through other means.
- Score: [NA]

3. Setting
- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The CONFIDENCE study was a multinational, multicenter, randomized, parallel-group, phase 4, open-label study conducted at 88 study centers in 14 countries.&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The trial was conducted in multiple centers across various countries, suggesting a more pragmatic approach as it reflects a diverse range of real-world settings where the intervention might be applied.
- Score: [4]

4. Organization
- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Eligible patients were randomly assigned 1:1 to receive subcutaneous injections of GA40 (n = 431) or GA20 (n = 430).&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The trial appears to have been organized in a way that reflects usual care, with patients receiving subcutaneous injections of the intervention. However, the text does not provide specific details about the resources and expertise required to deliver the intervention.
- Score: [NA]

5. Flexibility (delivery)
- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Eligible patients were randomly assigned 1:1 to receive subcutaneous injections of GA40 (n = 431) or GA20 (n = 430).&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The trial protocol appears to be quite rigid in terms of how the intervention is delivered, with patients assigned to receive specific doses of the intervention. This suggests a more explanatory approach.
- Score: [2]

6. Flexibility (adherence)
- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Adherence to treatment when the dosing schedule differs is complicated, because missing one dose has potentially differential impacts on treatment.&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The trial acknowledges the potential challenges with adherence due to the dosing schedule, but it does not appear to allow for flexibility in how participants adhere to the intervention.
- Score: [2]

7. Follow-up
- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Five scheduled visits at study sites occurred at screening (within 2 weeks prior to baseline), baseline (Month 0), and Months 1, 3, and 6 (end of the core phase).&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The follow-up schedule for this trial is quite structured, with specific visits scheduled at predetermined times. This suggests a more explanatory approach, as it does not reflect the variability that might be seen in follow-up schedules in a real-world setting.
- Score: [2]

8. Primary outcome
- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The primary endpoint was patient-reported medication satisfaction using the Medication Satisfaction Questionnaire (MSQ).&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The primary outcome of this trial is patient-reported medication satisfaction, which is a relevant and important outcome for patients. This suggests a more pragmatic approach.
- Score: [5]

9. Primary analysis
- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Patient-reported endpoints used self-reported questionnaires, whereas safety endpoints were assessed by the physicians.&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The primary analysis of this trial includes both patient-reported outcomes and physician-assessed safety endpoints. This suggests a more pragmatic approach, as it includes a range of data sources that reflect both patient experiences and clinical outcomes.
- Score: [4]</pre>

<p><i><span style="border-bottom: 1px dashed black;">9 quote(s) from
publication full text</span> (mean similarity 100%)</i></p>
<pre>
1. Eligibility criteria

- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The study had assessor-blinded outcome assessments with use of clinician-rated and patient-rated measures at baseline, 20 weeks, and 36 weeks.&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The trial included participants with progressive multiple sclerosis and severe mobility impairment. The eligibility criteria were not overly restrictive, allowing for a broad range of participants representative of the population that would receive the intervention in a real-world setting. However, the full text does not provide detailed information about the specific inclusion and exclusion criteria.
- Score: [4]

2. Recruitment

- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants were recruited through eight health care organisations, including the UK National Health Service (NHS) Trusts, social enterprises, and third sector multiple sclerosis therapy centres, in two regions (Devon–Cornwall and East Anglia) of the UK.&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The recruitment process was conducted through various health care organisations, which suggests a pragmatic approach. However, the full text does not provide detailed information about the specific recruitment strategies used.
- Score: [4]

3. Setting

- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The SUMS study was an individually randomised, controlled, pragmatic, multi centre, superiority trial with masked outcome assessments in people with progressive multiple sclerosis.&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The trial was conducted in multiple centres across two regions in the UK, which suggests a pragmatic approach as it reflects the diversity of real-world settings where the intervention would be applied.
- Score: [5]

4. Organisation

- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The intervention consisted of two home-based physiotherapy sessions (60 min each) to set up the standing frame programme, supported by six follow-up telephone calls (15 min per call).&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The intervention was delivered in the participants' homes and supported by telephone calls, which suggests a pragmatic approach as it reflects the organisation of care delivery in a real-world setting. However, the full text does not provide detailed information about the resources and expertise required to deliver the intervention.
- Score: [4]

5. Flexibility (delivery)

- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants were asked to stand for 30 min, three times per week over 20 weeks, and encouraged to continue in the longer term, although no further physiotherapy support was provided.&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The intervention allowed for flexibility in its delivery, with participants encouraged to continue the standing frame programme in the longer term without further physiotherapy support. This suggests a pragmatic approach as it reflects the flexibility likely in usual care.
- Score: [5]

6. Flexibility (adherence)

- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Two thirds of the participants in the standing frame group continued to stand regularly in the frame during the 36 week period, which, in light of the literature, we consider to be a high proportion.&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The trial allowed for flexibility in how participants adhered to the intervention, with two thirds of the participants in the standing frame group continuing to stand regularly during the 36-week period. This suggests a pragmatic approach as it reflects the flexibility likely in usual care.
- Score: [5]

7. Follow-up

- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;After baseline assessment, participants were randomised (1:1) by computer-generated assignment to either a standing frame programme plus usual care or usual care alone.&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The follow-up procedures in the trial were not described in detail in the full text. Therefore, it is not possible to assess the intensity of follow-up and how it compares to usual care.
- Score: [NA]

8. Primary outcome

- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The primary clinical outcome was motor function measured by the Amended Motor Club Assessment (AMCA) score at week 36.&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The primary outcome of the trial was motor function, which is a clinically relevant outcome for participants with progressive multiple sclerosis. However, the full text does not provide detailed information about how this outcome was measured and whether it was assessed in a way that is similar to usual care.
- Score: [4]

9. Primary analysis

- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The primary analysis of the primary outcome, AMCA score at 36 weeks, followed a modified intention to treat approach, regardless of compliance to the intervention.&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The primary analysis of the trial included all data, regardless of compliance to the intervention, which suggests a pragmatic approach as it reflects the intention-to-treat principle commonly used in real-world settings.

<pre>
1. Eligibility criteria

Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The subjects were eligible for recruiting if they met the following criteria: (1) age > 18 years; (2) established diagnosis of the specific pathological condition MS, stroke or TBI; (3) nine hole peg test (NHPG) performed in more than 25 seconds; (4) ability to move at least one peg in 180 seconds during the NHPG; (5) sufficient autonomous functioning; (6) internet connection or telephone line and reachable internet provider; (7) clinical status stable; (8) discharged from hospital or rehabilitation setting – person lives at home.&quot;</span>
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Exclusions were: a) disturbed upper limb function not related to MS, TBI or stroke; B) serious cognitive and/or behavioral problems; c) serious emotional problems; D) major visual problems; (e) communication problems; F) medical complications; G) other problems possibly contra-indicating autonomous exercise at home.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The eligibility criteria for this trial are quite specific and include several exclusions, such as serious cognitive or behavioral problems, major visual problems, and communication problems. This suggests that the trial is not fully representative of the general population of patients with MS, stroke, or TBI, as it excludes those with certain comorbidities or complications. 

Score: [2]

2. Recruitment

Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Patients were recruited from Unità Organica di Riabilitazione Intensiva Neuromotoria (UOrIN, Italy), Foundation Institute Guttmann (FPING, Spain) and from National Multiple Sclerosis Centre (NMSc, Belgium).&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The recruitment process is not clearly described in the text. It is mentioned that patients were recruited from specific rehabilitation centers, but there is no information on how these patients were approached or selected for participation. 

Score: [NA]

3. Setting

Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;All measurements were performed at the centre where the patient had been treated.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial was conducted in the same setting where the patients usually receive their treatment, which suggests a pragmatic approach. However, the text does not provide detailed information about the setting, such as the type of clinic or hospital, the geographical location, or the healthcare system in which the trial was conducted.

Score: [4]

4. Organisation

Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The intervention group underwent one month of usual care, followed by approximately 4 training sessions with the H-CAD system in the hospital.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial seems to have been integrated into the usual care setting, with the intervention being delivered alongside usual care. However, the text does not provide detailed information about the resources or expertise required to deliver the intervention, or how the delivery of care was organized.

Score: [NA]

5. Flexibility (delivery)

Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The actual intervention with the H-CAD system at home consisted of one month, whereby the patients had an average of one training session a day lasting 30 minutes for at least 5 days a week.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The intervention appears to have been delivered with a certain degree of flexibility, as it was conducted at home and could be scheduled according to the patient's convenience. However, the text does not provide detailed information about how the intervention was delivered, such as whether there were specific protocols or guidelines that had to be followed.

Score: [NA]

6. Flexibility (adherence)

Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The exercise compliance during treatment varied; the average days exercising with the system was 24 days (SD = 9, range 7-39 days).&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The text suggests that there was some flexibility in terms of adherence to the intervention, as the number of days exercising with the system varied among participants. However, the text does not provide detailed information about how adherence was monitored or encouraged.

Score: [NA]

7. Follow-up

Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The third measurement (T2) was performed after the month of H-CAD intervention for the intervention group and 2 months after baseline for the control group. A month after T2 a follow up measurement was performed (T3) for the intervention group.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The follow-up period seems to be relatively short, with measurements taken at baseline, after the intervention, and one month after the intervention. The text does not provide information about whether any additional follow-up was conducted beyond this period.

Score: [3]

8. Primary outcome

Quotes:
- <span title='Moderate quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 82.6%):

lItAtIon clInIcAl trIAl was: is the use of the H-caD system for one month at least as good as usual care for the arm/hand function in stroke, tBI and MS patients?' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ff9e81'>&quot;The main research question in this validation trial was: is the use of the H-CAD system for one month at least as good as usual care for the arm/hand function in stroke, TBI and MS patients?&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The primary outcome of the trial is clearly relevant to the participants, as it directly measures the effectiveness of the intervention in improving arm/hand function. This suggests a pragmatic approach to the choice of primary outcome.

Score: [5]

9. Primary analysis

Quotes:
- <span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 97.8%):

the primary outcome measures at t0 (baseline), t1, t2 and t3 are reported in Table 2 for all three diagnoses groups and presented separately for the control and intervention group.' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;The primary outcome measures at T0 (baseline), T1, T2 and T3 are reported in Table 2 for all three diagnoses groups and presented separately for the control and the intervention group.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The text suggests that all available data were included in the analysis of the primary outcome, which is consistent with an intention-to-treat approach. However, the text does not provide detailed information about how the analysis was conducted.

<pre>
1. Eligibility criteria:

Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants had a confirmed diagnosis of multiple sclerosis, an Extended Disability Status Scale score of 5 (ambulatory without aid or rest for about 200 m) to 6.5 (constant bilateral assistance required to walk about 20 m without resting), stable rehabilitation and drug therapy for 30 days before entry into the study, cognitive scores of over 24 on the Mini-Mental State Examination and access to the intervention sites using their own or public transport.&quot;</span>
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Potential participants were excluded if they had experienced exacerbation of their multiple sclerosis symptoms three months prior to the study, or had any medical condition which may preclude them from taking part in the exercise intervention.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The eligibility criteria for this trial are quite specific, including a confirmed diagnosis of multiple sclerosis, a certain range of disability scores, stable rehabilitation and drug therapy, and access to the intervention sites. This suggests that the trial is not fully representative of the broader population of individuals with multiple sclerosis, as it excludes those with more severe disabilities, those with unstable treatment regimens, and those without access to the intervention sites. 

Score: [2]

2. Recruitment:

Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Of the 873 patients on the clinical register for multiple sclerosis 159 patients were deemed suitable for the study. These people were sent invitation letters and participant information sheets.&quot;</span>
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Forty-three potential participants expressed an interest in participating.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The recruitment process involved identifying potential participants from a clinical register and sending them invitation letters and information sheets. This approach is somewhat pragmatic as it mimics the way patients might be informed about new treatment options in a usual care setting. However, it also involves an extra step of identifying suitable patients from a register, which may not be typical in usual care.

Score: [3]

3. Setting:

Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The intervention took place at two different geographical locations (Site A and Site B).&quot;</span>
- <span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 98.9%):

t study was undertaken in two community leisure setting, this is one of the first studies to utilise this format and, as there is a trend toward longer term rehabilitation and symptom management in the community in the UK, 30,31 the results of this study are timely.' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;This study was undertaken in two community leisure setting, this is one of the first studies to utilise this format and, as there is a trend toward longer term rehabilitation and symptom management in the community in the UK, the results of this study are timely.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial was conducted in two community leisure settings, which is a pragmatic choice as it reflects a real-world setting where the intervention might be implemented. This suggests that the trial results could be applicable to similar settings in the usual care context.

Score: [5]

4. Organisation:

Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Each group was led by two instructors (one physiotherapist and one fitness instructor). The same physiotherapist was present at both sites; however fitness instructors were different between sites.&quot;</span>
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants were provided with exercise progress cards and were asked to record which level they performed each exercise at each session.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The organisation of the trial intervention involved a team of two instructors (a physiotherapist and a fitness instructor) at each site, and participants were asked to record their exercise progress. This level of organisation and monitoring is more intensive than what might be expected in usual care, suggesting a more explanatory approach.

Score: [2]

5. Flexibility (delivery):

Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Through discussion with the instructors, participants chose which level of each exercise they deemed appropriate and also when and how each exercise should be progressed.&quot;</span>
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants worked at a self-regulated pace for each exercise.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial allowed for a high degree of flexibility in the delivery of the intervention, with participants able to choose the level of each exercise and work at their own pace. This reflects a pragmatic approach, as it mirrors the flexibility that would likely be present in a usual care setting.

Score: [5]

6. Flexibility (adherence):

Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Including those who discontinued participation, the total attendance at the classes was 340 sessions out of a possible 480 (71%) with participants missing classes due to other appointments, family/work commitments, transport problems, holidays or mild ill-health (e.g. common cold).&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial allowed for flexibility in adherence, with participants able to miss classes due to other commitments or health issues. This is a pragmatic approach, as it reflects the realities of adherence in a usual care setting where individuals may not always be able to attend every session due to various life circumstances.

Score: [5]

7. Follow-up:

Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Outcome measures were carried out within the local hospital’s rehabilitation unit. They were taken at baseline, after 8 and 12 weeks of the intervention period (i.e. either the exercise class or usual care).&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The follow-up in this trial involved taking outcome measures at baseline and after 8 and 12 weeks of the intervention. This is a relatively short follow-up period and the frequency of follow-up visits is not specified, making it difficult to assess the level of pragmatism in this domain.

Score: [NA]

8. Primary outcome:

Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The primary outcome measure was 25-foot (7.6 m) walk time, secondary outcomes assessed walking endurance, balance, physical function, leg strength, body mass index, activity levels, fatigue, anxiety and depression, quality of life and goal attainment.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The primary outcome of the trial, the 25-foot walk time, is a measure that is directly relevant to the participants' daily lives and would likely be of interest in a usual care setting. This suggests a pragmatic approach to the choice of primary outcome.

Score: [5]

9. Primary analysis:

Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;All outcome measures were analysed on the basis of intention to treat, with all variables summarized and comparisons made between groups and over time.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial used an intention-to-treat analysis, which includes all participants regardless of their adherence to the intervention. This is a pragmatic approach, as it reflects the reality of treatment adherence in a usual care setting.

1. Eligibility criteria

Quotes:
- <span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 98.4%):

2012. Inclusion criteria were: having MS (MacDonald criteria); being able to complete a questionnaire; and being in need for a multidisciplinary approach, defined by the requirement, in addition to the neurology specialist, of at least two different medical (rehabilitation specialist, neurourology specialist, psychiatrist) or allied health professionals (physiotherapist, occupational therapist, social worker, psychologist, and neuropsycholo' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;Inclusion criteria were: having MS (MacDonald criteria); being able to complete a questionnaire; and being in need for a multidisciplinary approach, defined by the requirement, in addition to the neurology specialist, of at least two different medical (rehabilitation specialist, neuro-urology specialist, psychiatrist) or allied health professionals (physiotherapist, occupational therapist, social worker, psychologist, and neuropsychologist).&quot;</span>
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Patients who were not living independently in the community were excluded.&quot;</span>

Reasoning:
The eligibility criteria for this trial are quite specific, requiring patients to have MS, be able to complete a questionnaire, and be in need of a multidisciplinary approach. This suggests that the trial is not including all patients who might receive the intervention in a usual care setting, but rather a specific subset of patients who meet these criteria. This leans towards an explanatory approach.

Score: [2]

2. Recruitment

Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;MS patients from the outpatient clinic of the Neurology Department of Pitie´-Salpeˆtrie`re Hospital were prospectively enrolled in the study between March 2010 and July 2012.&quot;</span>

Reasoning:
The recruitment process for this trial involved enrolling patients from a specific outpatient clinic, which suggests that the trial may not be representative of all patients who might receive the intervention in a usual care setting. This leans towards an explanatory approach.

Score: [2]

3. Setting

Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;This is a prospective, randomized, controlled, monocentric clinical trial in MS patients.&quot;</span>

Reasoning:
The trial is conducted in a single center, which suggests that the setting may not be representative of all settings where the intervention might be applied in usual care. This leans towards an explanatory approach.

Score: [2]

4. Organisation

Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Two treatment strategies were compared: (i) an integrated multidisciplinary (IMD) approach, consisting of a half-day individually tailored comprehensive assessment in the MS clinic; and (ii) a standard care.&quot;</span>

Reasoning:
The trial involves comparing two different treatment strategies, one of which involves a comprehensive assessment in the MS clinic. This suggests that the trial may require additional resources and expertise beyond what would be available in a usual care setting, leaning towards an explanatory approach.

Score: [2]

5. Flexibility (delivery)

Quotes:
- <span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 95.7%):

Reasoning:
The trial involves a specific plan for delivering the intervention within a certain timeframe, which suggests that there may be less flexibility in how the intervention is delivered compared to a usual care setting. This leans towards an explanatory approach.

Score: [2]

6. Flexibility (adherence)

Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;A trial with no special measures to enforce engagement or compliance would score at or close to 5 on PRECIS-2. On the other hand, a trial protocol that lays out methods to monitor and ensure patient compliance would score at or close to 1 on PRECIS-2.&quot;</span>

Reasoning:
The full text does not provide specific information about measures to ensure participant adherence to the intervention.

Score: [NA]

7. Follow-up

Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Primary and secondary outcomes were assessed at inclusion, and after six (M6) and 12 (M12) months.&quot;</span>

Reasoning:
The trial involves specific follow-up assessments at predetermined time points, which suggests that there may be less flexibility in the follow-up process compared to a usual care setting. This leans towards an explanatory approach.

Score: [2]

8. Primary outcome

Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The primary outcome was the impact of the strategy on quality of life (QoL) measured using the MSIS-29 scale at inclusion and after six months.&quot;</span>

Reasoning:
The primary outcome of the trial is the impact on quality of life, which is a patient-relevant outcome. This suggests a more pragmatic approach.

Score: [4]

9. Primary analysis

Quotes:
- <span title='Moderate quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 93.7%):

<pre>
1. Eligibility criteria:
- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants were non-institutionalized adults (age ⩾ 18 years) with severe MS and their primary carers. Other patient inclusion criteria were primary or secondary progressive MS, Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score ⩾ 8.0, complex symptoms, and ⩾2 unmet care needs.&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The trial includes adults with severe MS and their primary carers. The inclusion criteria are quite specific, including a certain level of disability (EDSS score ⩾ 8.0), complex symptoms, and at least two unmet care needs. This suggests that the trial is not fully pragmatic as it does not include all individuals with MS, but rather a specific subset with severe disease and unmet care needs.
- Score: [2]

2. Recruitment:
- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Between January and November 2015, 50 dyads assigned to receive HPA and 26 assigned to receive UC were analyzed.&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The text does not provide specific details on how participants were recruited into the trial. Therefore, it is not possible to assess the pragmatism of the recruitment process.
- Score: [NA]

3. Setting:
- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;In this randomized, examiner-blind, controlled study, we recruited patients from three Italian centers.&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The trial was conducted in three Italian centers, suggesting a somewhat pragmatic approach as it includes multiple settings. However, the text does not provide enough information to assess whether these settings are representative of the usual care settings where the results are likely to be applied.
- Score: [NA]

4. Organization:
- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;At each center, a multi-professional team delivered the 6-month intervention.&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The intervention was delivered by a multi-professional team at each center, which suggests a certain level of organization and resources beyond what might be available in usual care. This suggests a more explanatory approach.
- Score: [2]

5. Flexibility (delivery):
- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;After a comprehensive assessment of the dyad needs based on direct observation and on visit 1 information (available via the eCRF), the HPA team defined the contents of the intervention, involving the dyad and the patient caring physician (the intervention was not intended to replace existing services).&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The intervention was tailored to the needs of each dyad, suggesting a certain level of flexibility in its delivery. However, the intervention was also defined by the HPA team and involved the patient caring physician, suggesting some level of standardization.
- Score: [3]

6. Flexibility (adherence):
- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The team was not on call for dyads: in the event of emergencies, dyads contacted the patient caring physician or emergency medical services.&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The text does not provide specific information on measures to ensure participants adhere to the intervention. However, the fact that the team was not on call for dyads suggests a certain level of flexibility in adherence.
- Score: [NA]

7. Follow-up:
- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;A blind examiner assessed dyads at baseline, 3 months, and 6 months.&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The follow-up schedule appears to be more frequent than what might be expected in usual care, suggesting a more explanatory approach.
- Score: [2]

8. Primary outcome:
- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Primary outcome measures were Palliative care Outcome Scale-Symptoms-MS (POS-S-MS) and Schedule for the Evaluation of Individual Quality of Life-Direct Weighting (SEIQoL-DW, not assessed in severely cognitively compromised patients).&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The primary outcomes are relevant to the participants and are likely to be of interest in usual care. However, the use of specific scales to measure these outcomes suggests a more explanatory approach.
- Score: [3]

9. Primary analysis:
- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;All randomly assigned patients were included in the main intention-to-treat analysis, provided that at least one contact with the team occurred (HPA group).&quot;</span>

Eligibility criteria:
1. Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;MS patients older than 18 years who had a confirmed MS with spasticity of the lower limbs and an Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score between 4 and 6.5 were eligible for inclusion.&quot;</span>
2. Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Patients who had received hippotherapy within the last 12 months, a body weight over 90 kg, no balance while sitting, and acute exacerbation during the 4-week period before start of the therapy were excluded.&quot;</span>
The trial has specific inclusion and exclusion criteria, which may limit the generalizability of the results to the broader MS population. For example, patients who had received hippotherapy within the last 12 months or those with a body weight over 90 kg were excluded. This suggests a more explanatory approach to the eligibility criteria.

1. Eligibility criteria

Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Eligible participants were male 35–65 yr old with a BMI of Q28 kgIm j2 and met PA safety requirements (i.e., no risk indicated by the Physical Activity Readiness Questionnaire [36] or clearance from a health care provider).&quot;</span>
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;At baseline, groups were balanced on most demographic and health history characteristics, as well as study outcomes.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The eligibility criteria for the trial were quite broad, including male hockey fans aged 35-65 with a BMI of 28 or above. This suggests a pragmatic approach, as it includes a wide range of individuals who would be likely to receive the intervention in a real-world setting. However, the requirement for clearance from a healthcare provider may slightly limit the generalizability of the trial to usual care.

Score: [4]

2. Recruitment

Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Recruitment occurred using a variety of methods (e.g., hockey team e-mail blasts and social media accounts, study Web site (http://hockeyfansintraining.org/), posters, traditional media advertisements, word of mouth, direct contact at team arena).&quot;</span>
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Eighty men were recruited in 4 wk; trial retention was 980% at 12 wk and 975% at 12 months.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The recruitment methods used in the trial were diverse and likely to be similar to those used in a real-world setting, suggesting a pragmatic approach. The high retention rate also indicates that the recruitment methods were effective in engaging participants.

Score: [5]

3. Setting

Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;We used a pragmatic approach for the program venue at each site, using a combination of the hockey team_s arena and an affiliated health club facility.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial was conducted in settings that are representative of where the intervention would likely be implemented in the real world, suggesting a pragmatic approach. The use of hockey arenas and affiliated health club facilities aligns with the cultural significance of hockey in Canada.

Score: [5]

4. Organisation

Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The Hockey FIT pro- gram was delivered over 12 weekly, 90-min sessions by Hockey FIT coaches (coach to participant ratio 2:20) from the central research team.&quot;</span>
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;In addition to the weekly in-person sessions, participants took part in an incremental pedometer-based walking program and they both set and tracked lifestyle prescriptions for PA (steps), exercise, and healthy eating.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The organisation of the intervention required additional resources and expertise beyond what would typically be available in usual care, such as the involvement of Hockey FIT coaches and the use of a pedometer-based walking program. This suggests a more explanatory approach.

Score: [3]

5. Flexibility (delivery)

Quotes:
- <span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 99.5%):

Program sessions comprised the following: 1) classroom-based teaching of behavior change techniques and simple information sharing on PA and healthy eating, delivered to encourage participant interaction and mutual learning, and 2) exercise sessions where men performed aerobic, strength, and flexibility exercises, incorporating their passion for hockey off the ice.' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;Program sessions com- prised the following: 1) classroom-based teaching of behavior change techniques and simple information sharing on PA and healthy eating, delivered to encourage participant interaction and mutual learning, and 2) exercise sessions where men performed aerobic, strength, and flexibility exercises, incorporating their passion for hockey off the ice.&quot;</span>
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;At the start of the program, more time was allocated to classroom education, but as the program progressed, more time was spent on group-based exercise.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The delivery of the intervention was quite structured, with specific components and a progression from classroom education to group-based exercise. This suggests a more explanatory approach, as it may not reflect the variability and flexibility of intervention delivery in a real-world setting.

Score: [2]

6. Flexibility (adherence)

Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;For 12 wk (Hockey FIT active phase or control), there were no serious adverse events reported. Participants reporting any adverse event were numerically higher for intervention (11 (27.5%)) compared with those in the comparator group (1 (2.5%)); however, most adverse events (11/12) were musculoskeletal and only 2 (5%) were considered possibly or definitely related to the intervention.&quot;</span>
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;When examining clinically significant weight loss of at least 5% (18), our results indicate that men participating in Hockey FIT were 10 times more likely to achieve this weight loss by 12 wk compared with the controls.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial did not appear to have strict measures in place to ensure participant adherence to the intervention, suggesting a more pragmatic approach. The fact that most adverse events were not related to the intervention and that participants were able to achieve clinically significant weight loss suggests that adherence was not a major issue.

Score: [4]

7. Follow-up

Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Follow-up occurred at 12 wk (both groups) and 12 months (intervention group only to explore the sustainability of long-term change).&quot;</span>
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Overall, trial retention was 980% at 12 wk and 975% (intervention group only) at 12 months.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The follow-up period in the trial was relatively long, with measurements taken at 12 weeks and 12 months for the intervention group. This suggests a pragmatic approach, as it allows for the assessment of the long-term effects of the intervention. The high retention rate also indicates that the follow-up procedures were acceptable to participants.

Score: [4]

8. Primary outcome

Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The planned primary outcome for the definitive trial was the difference between groups in mean weight loss (kg) and percentage weight change from baseline to 12 wk.&quot;</span>
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;At 12 wk, the intervention group lost 3.6 kg (95% confidence interval, j5.26 to j1.90 kg) more than the comparator group (P G 0.001) and maintained this weight loss to 12 months.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The primary outcome of the trial was weight loss, which is a clinically relevant and easily understandable outcome for participants. This suggests a pragmatic approach, as it reflects an outcome that would be important in a real-world setting.

Score: [5]

9. Primary analysis

Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;We analyzed outcome data to examine the potential effectiveness of the Hockey FIT program on the basis of an intent-to-treat approach.&quot;</span>
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;We ran an additional linear mixed-effects model within the intervention group only to obtain exploratory estimates for mean change from baseline to 12 months.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial used an intention-to-treat analysis, which includes all participants regardless of their adherence to the intervention. This suggests a pragmatic approach, as it reflects the variability in adherence that would be expected in a real-world setting.

<pre>
1. Eligibility criteria

Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The inclusion criteria were: a positive diagnosis of RA (1987 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria), age 18 years or older and the ability to complete questionnaires unaided.&quot;</span>
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Exclusions were: unstabilised concomitant disease, awaiting surgery and already receiving care from the practitioners involved in the study.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The eligibility criteria for this trial are quite broad, including anyone with a positive diagnosis of RA who is 18 years or older and able to complete questionnaires unaided. The exclusions are also pragmatic, excluding only those with unstabilised concomitant disease, those awaiting surgery, and those already receiving care from the practitioners involved in the study. This suggests that the trial is likely to include a wide range of patients with RA, making it more representative of the general population of patients with this condition.

Score: [4]

2. Recruitment

Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;After gaining patient consent, demographics and disease activity score in 28 joints (DAS28), patients were randomly assigned using a remote secure telephone randomisation service provided by Leeds University Clinical Trials Research Unit.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The recruitment process for this trial is not explicitly described in the text. However, it is mentioned that after gaining patient consent, patients were randomly assigned using a remote secure telephone randomisation service. This suggests that the recruitment process may have been somewhat pragmatic, but without more information, it is difficult to assess this domain fully.

Score: [NA]

3. Setting

Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The study was conducted in outpatient clinics of 10 rheumatology centres across the UK.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial was conducted in outpatient clinics of 10 rheumatology centres across the UK. This suggests a pragmatic approach as the trial setting is representative of the usual care setting where patients are treated for RA.

Score: [5]

4. Organisation

Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The NLC interventions usually include allocated 30-min time slots in which the CNS takes history, performs physical examination, pain control, prescribing or recommending medication and dosage changes, intra-articular or intramuscular steroid injections, provision of patient education, psychosocial support and ordering blood tests or X-rays.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The organisation of the trial seems to be quite pragmatic. The interventions are delivered by a CNS within a 30-minute time slot, which is a typical duration for a consultation in a usual care setting. The tasks performed by the CNS during this time are also typical of those performed in a usual care setting.

Score: [4]

5. Flexibility (delivery)

Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The usual RLC is similar to the above except that it usually involves an allocated 15-min time slot.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial allows for some flexibility in the delivery of the intervention. The NLC and RLC are similar in their tasks, but the time allocated for each consultation differs, with the NLC having a 30-minute slot and the RLC having a 15-minute slot. This suggests a somewhat pragmatic approach, as it reflects the variability in consultation times that might be seen in a usual care setting.

Score: [4]

6. Flexibility (adherence)

Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Ninety-two per cent (83/90) of patient under NLC attended all five clinic sessions, with a mean total consultation time of 111 min compared to 85% (77/91) of the RLC group who had a mean total consultation time of 71 min.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial does not appear to have any specific measures in place to ensure participants adhere to the intervention. The text mentions the percentage of patients who attended all five clinic sessions, but does not mention any measures taken to improve adherence. This suggests a pragmatic approach to adherence.

Score: [5]

7. Follow-up

Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Patients were seen by their respective practitioners at baseline and at weeks 13, 26, 39 and 52.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The follow-up schedule in this trial is quite structured, with patients seen at specific time points throughout the study. This may be more intensive than follow-up in a usual care setting, suggesting a more explanatory approach in this domain.

- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The primary outcome was the disease activity score (DAS28) assessed at baseline, weeks 13, 26, 39 and 52.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The primary outcome of this trial, the DAS28, is a measure that is directly relevant to patients with RA and is commonly used in usual care to assess disease activity. This suggests a pragmatic approach to the choice of primary outcome.

Score: [5]

9. Primary analysis

Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Analysis followed per-protocol (PP) and intention-to-treat (ITT) approaches.&quot;</span>
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The primary endpoint shows that NLC was not inferior to RLC at any follow-up time point.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial uses both per-protocol and intention-to-treat approaches to analysis, which is a pragmatic approach as it includes all data. The primary endpoint is based on a non-inferiority design, which is also pragmatic as it reflects the aim of the intervention to be at least as good as the standard care.

<p><i><span style="border-bottom: 1px dashed black;">9 quote(s) from
publication full text</span> (mean similarity 97.3%)</i></p>
<pre>
1. Eligibility criteria
- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants were included who scored >2 on the General Health Questionnaire 12, a measure of psychological distress, or >7 on the anxiety and depression subscales of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, thus confirming they had low mood.&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The eligibility criteria for this trial are quite specific, requiring participants to have a certain score on two different psychological distress scales. This suggests that the trial is not including all individuals with multiple sclerosis, but rather a subset of these individuals who also have low mood. This is less pragmatic as it does not reflect the full range of individuals who might receive this intervention in a usual care setting.
- Score: [2]

2. Recruitment
- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants were recruited for a randomized trial of adjustment groups for people with multiple sclerosis and low mood between June 2008 and September 2009.&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The text does not provide specific details about how participants were recruited, such as whether they were recruited from a usual care setting or through other means. Without this information, it is difficult to assess the pragmatism of the recruitment process.
- Score: [NA]

3. Setting
- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The groups were delivered by two Band 5 assistant psychologists, who were supervised by a Band 8a clinical psychologist, experienced in working with people with multiple sclerosis.&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The trial appears to be conducted in a specialized setting with trained psychologists, which may not reflect the usual care setting where the intervention would be applied. This suggests a more explanatory approach.
- Score: [2]

4. Organisation
- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The groups involved teaching people to recognise symptoms of distress and introduced them to strategies to improve their mood.&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The intervention requires specific resources, namely trained psychologists, and a structured program to teach participants strategies to improve their mood. This level of organization may not be available in usual care settings, suggesting a more explanatory approach.
- Score: [2]

5. Flexibility (delivery)
- Quote: <span title='Moderate quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 91.3%):

se allocated to intervention were invited to attend a psychological adjustment group for six sessions over 12 weeks.' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ff9e81'>&quot;Participants allocated to intervention were invited to attend a psychological adjustment group for six sessions over 12 weeks.&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The intervention is delivered in a structured manner with a set number of sessions over a specific period of time. This level of rigidity in the delivery of the intervention suggests a more explanatory approach.
- Score: [2]

6. Flexibility (adherence)
- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Those allocated to intervention were invited to attend a psychological adjustment group for six sessions over 12 weeks.&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The text does not provide specific information about measures in place to ensure participants adhere to the intervention. However, the structured nature of the intervention suggests that there may be less flexibility for participants in terms of adherence.
- Score: [NA]

7. Follow-up
- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Four and eight months after random allocation, participants were sent a booklet of outcome questionnaires to complete and return by post.&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The follow-up process involves sending participants questionnaires at specific time points, which may not reflect the usual care setting. This suggests a more explanatory approach.
- Score: [2]

8. Primary outcome
- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The primary analysis was the cost effectiveness of an adjustment group, as compared with a usual care control group for people with multiple sclerosis who had low mood.&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The primary outcome of cost effectiveness is relevant to participants and reflects a real-world concern. This suggests a more pragmatic approach.
- Score: [4]

9. Primary analysis
- Quote: <span title='Moderate quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 84.2%):

Over eight months follow-up there was a decrease in the combined average costs of £378 per intervention respondent and an increase in the costs of £297 per patient in the control group, which was a significant difference (p=0.03).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ff9e81'>&quot;Over eight months follow-up there was a decrease in the combined average costs of £378 per intervention respondent and an increase in the amount of combined resource and medication costs of £297 per patient in the control group, which was a significant difference (p=0.03).&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The primary analysis includes all data and does not exclude participants based on adherence or other factors. This suggests a more pragmatic approach.

<p><i><span style="border-bottom: 1px dashed black;">9 quote(s) from
publication full text</span> (mean similarity 98.9%)</i></p>
<pre>
1. Eligibility criteria
- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The inclusion criteria were: males and females; age 18 to 70; diagnosis of MS (primary or secondary progressive, relapsing-remitting), without relapses in the preceding three months and an Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score between 4 and 5.5.&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The eligibility criteria for this trial are quite specific, including age, gender, diagnosis, and EDSS score. This suggests that the trial is not fully pragmatic as it does not include all individuals who might receive the intervention in a real-world setting. However, the criteria are not overly restrictive and do not exclude individuals based on factors such as adherence or responsiveness to the intervention.
- Score: [3]

2. Recruitment
- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Patients have been recruited at Ferrara University Hospital from patients who attend the Rehabilitation Outpatient Clinic for gait rehabilitation.&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The recruitment process is somewhat pragmatic as it involves recruiting patients from a rehabilitation outpatient clinic, which is a usual care setting. However, the recruitment is limited to a single hospital, which may not fully represent the diversity of patients in the real world.
- Score: [3]

3. Setting
- Quote: <span title='Moderate quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 90.5%):

have been randomly assigned to 10 supervised TOCT sessions over two weeks (Phase 1) followed by a 12-weeks home-based task-oriented program (Phase 2) or a delayed-treatment group.' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ff9e81'>&quot;Eligible patients have been randomized to 10 supervised TOCT sessions over two weeks (Phase 1) followed by a 12-weeks home-based task-oriented program (Phase 2) or a delayed-treatment group.&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The trial setting includes both a supervised setting (the hospital) and a home-based setting, which is a pragmatic approach as it reflects the settings in which the intervention would likely be applied in the real world. However, the trial is conducted in a single hospital, which may limit the generalizability of the results.
- Score: [4]

4. Organisation
- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Phase 1 was composed of six gait-based workstations and treadmill training, whereas Phase 2 was based on progressive task-oriented tasks practice at home with monthly visits to adjust activities levels.&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The organisation of the intervention involves both supervised and home-based training, which is a pragmatic approach as it reflects how the intervention would likely be delivered in the real world. However, the need for monthly visits to adjust activity levels may not be feasible in usual care.
- Score: [4]

5. Flexibility (delivery)
- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;At home, we recommended 60-minute sessions three times/week. The home-based program includes overground walking practice and exercises with similar modalities and difficulty as learnt during Phase 1.&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The delivery of the intervention is flexible, with patients able to perform the exercises at home at their own convenience. This is a pragmatic approach as it reflects how the intervention would likely be delivered in the real world.
- Score: [5]

6. Flexibility (adherence)
- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;A mean adherence of 6.2 out of 10 was reported for the home-based TOCT program.&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The trial allows for some flexibility in adherence, as evidenced by the reported adherence rate. This is a pragmatic approach as it reflects the variability in adherence that would likely be seen in the real world.
- Score: [5]

7. Follow-up
- Quote: <span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 99.6%):

The blind evaluator, who did not supervise the training program, performed functional tests, questionnaires and instrumental measurements the week before treatment, the week after the end of the supervised-TOCT, after the 12-weeks home-based TOCT program' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;The blind evaluator, who did not supervise the training program, performed functional tests, questionnaires and instrumental measurements the week before treatment, the week after the end of the supervised-TOCT, after the 12-weeks home-based TOCT program.&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The follow-up in this trial is more intensive than would typically occur in usual care, with multiple assessments conducted by a blind evaluator. This suggests a more explanatory approach.
- Score: [2]

8. Primary outcome
- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The primary outcome measure was the 6-minute walking test (6MWT) for walking endurance.&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The primary outcome of walking endurance is highly relevant to patients with multiple sclerosis and is likely to be measured in a similar way in usual care. This suggests a pragmatic approach.
- Score: [5]

9. Primary analysis
- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;An intention-to-treat analysis was carried out on all outcome measures, handling missing data (n = 2 at T1, n = 7 at T2) with the last observation carried forward approach.&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The use of an intention-to-treat analysis with all available data is a pragmatic approach as it includes all participants regardless of adherence or completion of the intervention.

# The nine domains of PRECIS-2

## 1. Eligibility criteria: Who is selected to participate in the trial?

A highly pragmatic approach to eligibility criteria would be to include in the trial anyone with the condition of interest who is likely to be a candidate for the intervention if it was being provided in usual care for this condition. So, if in usual care the intervention would likely be used for children, elderly people, people with a range of comorbidities, and people with a probable diagnosis rather than, say, a laboratory confirmed diagnosis, then all of these groups should be in the trial too. If people aged over 80 or with multiple morbidities would not receive the intervention in usual care because we already know that this intervention does more harm than good in elderly or multi-morbid patients, then a pragmatic design choice would be to exclude them from the trial. A trial with eligibility design choices like this would score at or close to 5 on the PRECIS-2 scale.

As the level of similarity between the people in the trial and those in usual care decreases, then so would the PRECIS-2 score. Many things could reduce the score, but some examples include

* Excluding people not known or shown to be highly adherent to the intervention.
* Excluding people using tests or measures that are not used or available in usual care.
* Excluding people not expected to be highly responsive to the intervention.
* Excluding people who would be likely to receive the intervention in usual care but inclusion in the trial is considered too difficult because of challenges unrelated to the delivery of the intervention. Children, people over the age of 65, and pregnant women are good examples of people commonly excluded because of anticipated difficulties of gaining ethical approval rather than whether they would be likely to receive an intervention in usual care.
* Excluding people whose adherence and follow-up may pose difficulties, whether because of social disadvantage, personal circumstances, or illness (such as homelessness, substance misuse, mental health problems, or poor motivation).
* Excluding people dependent on help for activities of daily living, unless they would usually not be eligible for intervention.

Finally, exclusion criteria for known safety issues would not generally reduce the PRECIS-2 score since such individuals would not be expected to get the intervention in usual care.

## 2. Recruitment: How are participants recruited into the trial?

This domain has been included to encourage trialists to consider how and where they will recruit people to their trial.

The most extreme pragmatic approach to recruitment would be to do this in usual care so that only the people who attend a clinic with the condition of interest are recruited after they present on their own behalf without any overt recruitment effort. A highly pragmatic approach to trial design would also recruit from more than one clinic as an explicit way of increasing applicability of the trial results. Recruiting through usual appointments at a diverse range of clinics is likely to score at or close to 5 on the PRECIS-2 scale.

If the above is not feasible, at least as the sole recruitment route, trialists will need to add other recruitment strategies. If extra resources will be required to recruit people to the trial, trialists need to consider if this affects applicability, especially if participants are recruited from settings other than the one in which the results are likely to be applied. For example, recruiting in secondary care for an intervention that will mainly be used in primary care will ensure that the recruited patients are different in severity and treatment than the patients with this same condition in primary care; and so this will make the trial more explanatory and reduce the PRECIS 2 score. Additional recruitment approaches that could potentially reduce the PRECIS-2 score include

* Searching medical record systems for eligible participants and then mailing invitation letters. Depending on local resources, such as electronic medical records and comprehensive local disease registers, this approach may be easily achievable in usual care and so would not reduce the PRECIS-2 score.
* Media advertising campaigns such as television and radio advertisements, newspaper advertisements, flyers, websites, press releases, letters to the editor, interviews with the chief investigator on television or radio. The issue to consider here is whether these campaigns are being used simply to speed up recruitment, or because they are the only way to reach a dispersed population. In the latter case, if such campaigns would not be available in usual care then this trial recruitment route is more explanatory.
* Incentives such as cash payment, vouchers, travel costs, or childcare. Some of these incentives may be better considered as part of the intervention (for example, a lifestyle change intervention aimed at new mothers may only be effective because childcare was also provided and women could therefore attend sessions).

## 3. Setting: Where is the trial being done?

This domain has been included to encourage trialists to explicitly consider the match between the setting of their trial and the setting where their results are likely to be applied. While there are no accepted guidelines for how to assess the impact of setting on applicability, there are several characteristics of the setting that will almost always need to be considered, including geography, healthcare system, country, and the socioeconomic and ethnic mix of the population. All of these might affect the applicability of results from a particular trial.

The most extremely pragmatic approach to setting would be to do the trial in an identical setting to which you intend the results to be applied. Such a trial is likely to score at or close to 5 on PRECIS-2.

Even settings that seem rather restrictive could still be a highly pragmatic design choice if this setting is the usual care setting where patients are treated for the particular health condition. For example, if a trial was carried out in the most specialist intensive care units in the country and the intention of the trial was to support decision making in these highly specialised units, then the design choice with regard to setting is still pragmatic. Conversely, if the trial results were intended to be useful for all intensive care units, but the trial included only highly specialised units, then the trial is now taking a more explanatory approach to the choice of setting that goes against the intention of the trial.

Approaches to setting that are likely to reduce the PRECIS-2 score include

* Selecting participating centres from among only specialist or academic centres when the trial is intended to be applicable to all types of practice or clinic treating the condition of interest.
* Running the trial in a single centre. It is rare that a trial is done with the intention that its results should apply to only that single centre. Including several centres makes it easier to claim that the trial setting matches that to which the results will be applied.

## 4. Organisation: What expertise and resources are needed to deliver the intervention?

This domain has been included to encourage trialists to consider the match between how care is organised and delivered in the trial and how the intervention would be made available to patients in usual care. As there have been acknowledged difficulties in implementing results post-trial (even in settings where the trial was conducted), we wanted trialists to consider organising the delivery of their trial intervention with an awareness of how easy it would be to implement the intervention post-trial .

A highly pragmatic design would aim to slot the intervention into the usual organisation of care for the condition of interest, making use of no more than the existing healthcare staff and resources in that setting. A design like this is likely to score at or close to 5 on PRECIS-2.

Sometimes a change to how care is organised is itself the intervention being evaluated, and the difference between the trial and usual care is clear. In this case the organisation domain would be explanatory compared with current usual care, but trialists can note that the difference is an explicit feature of the intervention.

The PRECIS-2 organisation score will be reduced to the degree trialists make changes in how care is delivered compared with the usual recipients and care delivery. For example, the trial team may, in the intervention arm, provide additional training to staff or provide additional staff so that the intervention can be delivered. Patients who would normally be seen in primary care may be seen by specialists in secondary care instead, or they may receive additional expensive diagnostic procedures unavailable in usual care. The success or otherwise of the trial then depends on resources unavailable in usual care, reducing applicability. If these additional resources are essential to the effectiveness of the intervention they should be considered to be part of the intervention and be specified in the part of the protocol describing the intervention. In that case these resources should not be counted when this element of the trial is judged.

Organisational approaches that are likely to reduce the PRECIS-2 score include the following (but only when they are not incorporated and described as necessary elements of the intervention):

* Increasing the number of healthcare or other professionals available to deliver the intervention over and above the levels available in usual care.
* Providing significant levels of additional training to increase the expertise of healthcare professionals.
* Requiring healthcare professionals to have some minimum level of experience, defined by length of time, in working with the intervention that is greater than would be the case in usual care.
* Requiring healthcare professionals to have a specialty certification that would not be considered essential to deliver the intervention in usual care.
* Increasing the resources (such as facilities, diagnostic equipment, consumables) available to deliver the intervention, measure outcomes, or do follow-up over and above what would be available in usual care.

## 5. Flexibility (delivery): How should the intervention be delivered?

In PRECIS-2, trialists wishing to conduct more pragmatic trials are encouraged to think about how the intervention will be implemented post-trial in the setting where the results are expected to be applied. The most pragmatic design approach to delivery flexibility would leave the details of how to implement the intervention up to providers, in other words, what happens in usual care. Thus, the methodology of how to deliver an intervention is not rigidly prescriptive in the protocol. For example, the details of how to perform a surgical procedure could be left entirely to the surgeon, or how to deliver an educational programme is left to the discretion of the educator. Additionally, a pragmatic approach would not dictate which other interventions were permitted, or how to deliver them, which again is the situation in usual practice. This sort of delivery flexibility would score at or close to 5 on PRECIS-2. Flexibility (delivery) applies to all intervention arms and the comparator (control) arm if usual care is not the comparator, and if necessary each of these arms will need to be scored separately. If usual care is the intended comparator but any elements relating to delivery are changed it ceases to be usual care and needs to be scored.

As delivery flexibility is reduced, the trial moves towards a more explanatory approach in this domain. Approaches to delivery flexibility that are likely to reduce the PRECIS-2 score include

* A highly specified, protocol driven intervention. For example, specific direction is given for how to the administer the intervention (such as dose, dosing schedule, surgical procedures, educational material, and delivery)
* Having measures in place to monitor the compliance of those delivering the intervention (such as doctors) with the protocol and measures (up to and including exclusion) to address poor compliance.
* The timing of intervention delivery is tightly defined and designed to maximise the intervention effect.
* Providers undertake additional interventions that would not occur in usual care
* Restrictions are placed on the number and types of co-interventions, particularly if excluded co-interventions would dilute any intervention effect
* There is specific direction for applying permitted co-interventions
* There are specific directions for managing complications or side effects of the intervention.

## 6. Flexibility (adherence): What measures are in place to ensure participants adhere to the intervention?

It is important that trialists focused on applicability consider how probable it is that there will be uptake of the intervention being tested and how recipients will engage with it in the setting in which it will be later applied. A highly pragmatic design approach would allow for full flexibility in how end user recipients engage with the intervention. In usual care, health professionals encourage patients to take medication or follow therapy as best they can, and such encouragement would not count against a pragmatic design; if it also happens in usual care, allowing it in the trial is a pragmatic design decision. A trial with no special measures to enforce engagement or compliance would score at or close to 5 on PRECIS-2. On the other hand, a trial protocol that lays out methods to monitor and ensure patient compliance would score at or close to 1 on PRECIS-2. Flexibility (adherence) applies to all intervention arms and the comparator (control) arm if usual care if not the comparator, and if necessary each of these arms will need to be scored separately. If usual care is the intended comparator but any elements relating to adherence are changed it ceases to be usual care and needs to be scored.

It is possible that improving recipients’ ability to take medication or follow therapy is the intervention under evaluation, a situation similar to that already described for the Setting and Organisation domains. In this case, the Flexibility (adherence) domain would be explanatory compared with current usual care, but trialists can note that the difference is an explicit feature of the intervention.

As flexibility for recipients is reduced, the trial moves towards a more explanatory approach on this domain. Approaches to recipient flexibility that are likely to reduce the PRECIS-2 score include

* Having a trial pre-screening stage where patients are evaluated for adherence with the intervention (such as dose, dosing schedule, attendance at therapy sessions). Patients judged to not be adherent are excluded.
* Withdrawing patients from the trial if their adherence with the intervention drops below some specified level. For example, a trial might withdraw patients if they failed to attend two consecutive sessions of cognitive behavioural therapy or failed to take more than 90% of their medication.
* Having measures in place to monitor patient adherence with the protocol and measures (up to and including withdrawal) to address poor adherence. Measures to increase patient adherence should this fall below some specified level could, for example, include scheduling an extra discussion with a research nurse about why following the trial instructions is important.

## 7. Follow-up: How closely are participants followed up?

This domain encourages trialists to think about follow-up with regard to the setting where the results will be applied. The most pragmatic position with regard to follow-up would be to have no more follow-up of recipients than would be the case in usual care. Indeed, the most extreme position is to have no follow-up contact at all with recipients and to obtain outcome data by other means (such as electronic medical records or other usual data to measure mortality or hospital admissions). Trials that have no more follow-up than is normal in usual care and have minimal additional data collection (or use data obtained from administrative or clinical record systems without direct contact with the participant) would be likely to score at or close to 5 on PRECIS-2.

As follow-up becomes more intense, the trial becomes more explanatory and the PRECIS-2 score will decrease. Follow-up approaches that are likely to reduce the PRECIS-2 score include

* Follow-up visits that are more frequent than would typically occur under usual care.
* Unscheduled follow-up visits are triggered by a primary outcome event.
* Unscheduled follow-up visits are triggered by an intervening event that is likely to lead to the primary outcome event.
* Patients are contacted if they fail to keep trial appointments. This would not reduce the PRECIS-2 score if this was also done in usual care.
* More extensive data are collected, particularly intervention related data, than would be typical outside the trial
* Visits are longer than usual care and involve additional or different staff.

Often the required trial outcomes may be obtained only through contact with the recipients. Even in the “no follow-up” approach, assessment of outcomes may be achieved with a single follow-up at the end of the study. The end of study would need to be defined so that there is sufficient time for the desired study outcomes (see Primary outcome domain below) to be observed. When the follow-up is done in this way, it is unlikely to have an impact on engagement or response to the treatment, and so such a follow-up approach would be viewed as pragmatic and rated at or close to 5.

It is often the case that explanatory trials are interested in the effect of an intervention only during a brief intervention period or shortly after. On the other hand, trials taking a pragmatic approach to design may follow recipients well beyond the intervention period. This longer period of follow-up may require more contacts than would be the case in usual care, but this need not be inconsistent with a pragmatic approach if it does not result in care management that differs from the usual conditions. It is, however, important to consider the burden of follow-up for participants.

## 8. Primary outcome: How relevant is it to participants?

The choice of primary outcome is a crucial trial design decision, and a pragmatic approach would be to select an outcome that is of obvious importance from the patient’s perspective. Post-trial, an outcome selected using a pragmatic approach would also be relevant to commissioners of care, the people who decide whether to implement the intervention on the basis of its results. For example, an intervention that aims to reduce falls in elderly people living independently in the community should have as its primary outcome the number of falls in the elderly living independently in the community. This outcome has meaning to patients, their relatives and friends, healthcare professionals, and policymakers. Measures of, say, bone density, muscle strength, or functional ability are distant from the key question of whether the intervention prevents elderly people falling in their own homes. Trials that choose outcomes of obvious importance to patients, and measure them in a way that is the same or similar to the way they are measured in usual care would be likely to score at or close to 5 on PRECIS-2.

As the primary outcome becomes less recognisably important to patients, or is assessed on criteria seldom used in usual care, the trial becomes more explanatory and the PRECIS-2 score will decrease. Approaches to the primary outcomes that are likely to reduce the PRECIS-2 score include

* Choosing a surrogate outcome (such as blood test) that the intervention is expected to have a direct effect on, or the use of safety climate surveys rather than medical error events or near miss events.
* Using a composite primary outcome in which some of the elements are less important to patients or participants than others (such as incidence of death, stroke, myocardial infarction, or renal dysfunction at 30 days).
* Having central adjudication of the outcome or using an assessment that needs special training or tests not normally used in usual care.
* Choosing an outcome that is important but mainly to providers, typically because it is a physiological outcome considered useful in treatment planning and monitoring.
* Measuring an outcome that is important but at a time that is earlier than would be normal in usual care. For example, stroke could be a primary outcome in trials making explanatory or pragmatic design choices. However, time horizons may vary from short term after a one-time intervention (more explanatory) to long term (more pragmatic).

## 9. Primary analysis: To what extent are all data included?

Most trials are a superiority design so the most pragmatic approach with regard to the analysis would be to make no special allowance in the analysis for non-adherence, practice variability, etc. In other words, the pragmatic approach to the analysis would typically be an intention-to-treat analysis using all available data. This sort of analysis would score at or close to 5 on PRECIS-2. (Non-inferiority and equivalence trials are usually contrary to intention-to-treat analysis.)

The intention-to-treat analysis has recently also become the norm for superiority trials taking a more explanatory design approach, especially when regulatory approval for an intervention is being sought. The most explanatory approach would be to use the “as treated analysis” as the primary analysis, in which only those patients who actually received (or did not receive) the intervention would be analysed in the intervention and control groups respectively, irrespective of their initial randomised group allocation.

Other causes of missing data may be important but may not affect how pragmatic or explanatory a trial is. Systematic exclusion of data from participants because, say, they were poorly adherent would make a trial more explanatory. Using all data but doing nothing to try and fill gaps caused by missing data would not in itself make trial more pragmatic or explanatory; missing data, especially if there is a lot of it, makes any conclusions more uncertain regardless of the design approach taken.

Approaches to the primary analysis that are likely to reduce the PRECIS-2 score include

* Excluding non-compliant recipients (per protocol analysis)
* Analyse recipients to treatment received instead of treatment randomised (as treated analysis)
* Excluding data from non-adherent providers
* Excluding data from trial sites or providers who recruit below expected volume.

For some trials taking an explanatory approach (dose finding trials are an example), it may be appropriate to have primary analysis restricted in the ways mentioned; otherwise such restricted analyses of the primary outcome could be pre-planned as secondary analyses of the primary outcome.

# PRECIS-2 Domains
* Eligibility: To what extent are the participants in the trial similar to those who would receive this intervention if it was part of usual care? For example, score 5 for very pragmatic criteria essentially identical to those in usual care; score 1 for a very explanatory approach with lots of exclusions (e.g. those who don’t comply, respond to treatment, or are not at high risk for primary outcome, are children or elderly), or uses many selection tests not used in usual care.
* Recruitment: How much extra effort is made to recruit participants over and above what that would be used in the usual care setting to engage with patients? For example, score 5 for very pragmatic recruitment through usual appointments or clinic; score 1 for a very explanatory approach with targeted invitation letters, advertising in newspapers, radio plus incentives and other routes that would not be used in usual care.
* Setting: How different is the setting of the trial and the usual care setting? For example, score 5 for a very pragmatic choice using identical settings to usual care; score 1, for a very explanatory approach with only a single centre, or only specialised trial or academic centres.
* Organisation: How different are the resources, provider expertise and the organisation of care delivery in the intervention arm of the trial and those available in usual care? For example, score 5 for a very pragmatic choice that uses identical organisation to usual care; score 1 for a very explanatory approach if the trial increases staff levels, gives additional training, require more than usual experience or certification and increase resources.
* Flexibility (delivery): How different is the flexibility in how the intervention is delivered and the flexibility likely in usual care? For example, score 5 for a very pragmatic choice with identical flexibility to usual care; score 1 for a very explanatory approach if there is a strict protocol, monitoring and measures to improve compliance, with specific advice on allowed co-interventions and complications.
* Flexibility (adherence): How different is the flexibility in how participants must adhere to the intervention and the flexibility likely in usual care? For example, score 5 for a very pragmatic choice involving no more than usual encouragement to adhere to the intervention; score 1 for a very explanatory approach that involves exclusion based on adherence, and measures to improve adherence if found wanting. In some trials eg surgical trials where patients are being operated on or Intensive Care Unit trials where patients are being given IV drug therapy, this domain is not applicable as there is no compliance issue after consent has been given, so this score should be left blank.
* Follow-up: How different is the intensity of measurement and follow-up of participants in the trial and the likely follow-up in usual care? For example, score 5 for a very pragmatic approach with no more than usual follow up; score 1 for a very explanatory approach with more frequent, longer visits, unscheduled visits triggered by primary outcome event or intervening event, and more extensive data collection.
* Primary outcome: To what extent is the trial's primary outcome relevant to participants? For example, score 5 for a very pragmatic choice where the outcome is of obvious importance to participants; score 1 for a very explanatory approach using a surrogate, physiological outcome, central adjudication or use assessment expertise that is not available in usual care, or the outcome is measured at an earlier time than in usual care.
* Primary analysis: To what extent are all data included in the analysis of the primary outcome? For example, score 5 for a very pragmatic approach using intention to treat with all available data; score 1 for a very explanatory analysis that excludes ineligible post-randomisation participants, includes only completers or those following the treatment protocol.
