For the pooled results, a test should be done to ensure the studies were combinable, to assess their homogeneity (i.e., Chi-squared test for homogeneity, I2 ). If heterogeneity exists a random effects model should be used and/or the clinical appropriateness of combining should be taken into consideration (i.e., is it sensible to combine?).

An assessment of publication bias should include a combination of graphical aids (e.g., funnel plot, other available tests) and/or statistical tests (e.g., Egger regression test, Hedges-Olken). Note: If no test values or funnel plot included, score “no”. Score “yes” if mentions that publication bias could not be assessed because there were fewer than 10 included studies.">

title="Was a comprehensive literature search performed? At least two electronic sources should be searched. The report must include years and databases used (e.g., Central, EMBASE, and MEDLINE). Key words and/or MESH terms must be stated and where feasible the search strategy should be provided. All searches should be supplemented by consulting current contents, reviews, textbooks, specialized registers, or experts in the particular field of study, and by reviewing the references in the studies found. Note: If at least 2 sources + one supplementary strategy used, select “yes” (Cochrane register/Central counts as 2 sources; a grey literature search counts as supplementary).">

<th style="text-align:left;">
<span style="border-bottom: 1px dashed black"
title="Was the status of publication (i.e. grey literature) used as an inclusion criterion? The authors should state that they searched for reports regardless of their publication type. The authors should state whether or not they excluded any reports (from the systematic review), based on their publication status, language etc. Note: If review indicates that there was a search for “grey literature” or “unpublished literature,” indicate “yes.” SIGLE database, dissertations, conference proceedings, and trial registries are all considered grey for this purpose. If searching a source that contains both grey and non-grey, must specify that they were searching for grey/unpublished lit.">

In an aggregated form such as a table, data from the original studies should be provided on the participants, interventions and outcomes. The ranges of characteristics in all the studies analyzed e.g., age, race, sex, relevant socioeconomic data, disease status, duration, severity, or other diseases should be reported.

Note: Can include use of a quality scoring tool or checklist, e.g., Jadad scale, risk of bias, sensitivity analysis, etc., or a description of quality items, with some kind of result for EACH study (“low” or “high” is fine, as long as it is clear which studies scored “low” and which scored “high”; a summary score/range for all studies is not acceptable).">

<span style="border-bottom: 1px dashed black"
title="Was the scientific quality of the included studies used appropriately in formulating conclusions? The results of the methodological rigor and scientific quality should be considered in the analysis and the conclusions of the review, and explicitly stated in formulating recommendations. Note: Might say something such as “the results should be interpreted with caution due to poor quality of included studies.” Cannot score “yes” for this question if scored “no” for question A7.">
A8</span>
</th>
<th style="text-align:left;">
<span style="border-bottom: 1px dashed black"
title="Were the methods used to combine the findings of studies appropriate? For the pooled results, a test should be done to ensure the studies were combinable, to assess their homogeneity (i.e., Chi-squared test for homogeneity, I2 ). If heterogeneity exists a random effects model should be used and/or the clinical appropriateness of combining should be taken into consideration (i.e., is it sensible to combine?). Note: Indicate “yes” if they mention or describe heterogeneity, i.e., if they explain that they cannot pool because of heterogeneity/variability between interventions.">
A9</span>
</th>
<th style="text-align:left;">
<span style="border-bottom: 1px dashed black"
title="Was the likelihood of publication bias assessed? An assessment of publication bias should include a combination of graphical aids (e.g., funnel plot, other available tests) and/or statistical tests (e.g., Egger regression test, Hedges-Olken). Note: If no test values or funnel plot included, score “no”. Score “yes” if mentions that publication bias could not be assessed because there were fewer than 10 included studies.">
A10</span>
</th>
<th style="text-align:left;">
<span style="border-bottom: 1px dashed black"
title="Was the conflict of interest included? Potential sources of support should be clearly acknowledged in both the systematic review and the included studies. Note: To get a “yes,” must indicate source of funding or support for the systematic review AND for each of the included studies.">

Background/purpose: The emergency department thoracotomy (EDT) is rarely utilized in children, and is thus difficult to identify survival factors. We reviewed our experience and performed a systematic review of reports of EDT in pediatric patients. Methods: Patients age ≤18 years who received an EDT from 1991 to 2012 at our institution and all published case series were reviewed. Data analyzed include age, sex, mechanism of injury (MOI), injury patterns, presence of vital signs (VS) or signs of life (SOL) in the field/ED, return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC), and survival. Results: A total of 252 patients were analyzed. 84% were male. 51% sustained penetrating injuries, and median age was 15 years. Upon arrival, 17% had VS, and 35% had SOL. After EDT, 30% experienced ROSC. The survival rate was 1.6% for blunt trauma, 10.2% for penetrating injuries, and 6.0% overall. Conclusion: Survival of pediatric patients following EDT is comparable to recent analyses in adults. Children who sustain blunt injury and are without SOL have been uniformly unsalvageable. Children who sustain penetrating trauma and have SOL or are without SOL for a short time prior to arrival have been salvageable.

With recent reports showing the detrimental outcomes associated with a prolonged pre-hospital period, there has been a push for emergency medical services in urban environments to “scoop and run” rather than “stay and play” [17,18]. Many of these patients in the past would have been pronounced dead at the scene or at their community hospital emergency department. During this development, the resuscitative thoracotomy was also added as an extension to ATLS techniques [19].

P25.  
Quotes: 
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;There are limitations to this study. First, all of the data obtained from our institution were collected retrospectively, and thus not specifically collected for research purposes.

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Selection bias may have also affected results, as all EDT were performed at the discretion of the trauma physician.&quot;</span> (Discussion)

Here are my responses for assessing the methodological quality of this systematic review using the AMSTAR tool:

A1. Was an 'a priori' design provided? The research question and inclusion criteria should be established before the conduct of the review.

Relevant quotes:
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;A systematic review of all publications on the laparoscopic treatment of pediatric intussusception from January 1990 to April 2012 was performed.&quot;</span>
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Exclusion criteria were non-English language articles, case reports, laparoscopic-assisted enema reduction and mixed pediatric and adult populations (age cutoff 18 years).&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The authors specified the research question, inclusion/exclusion criteria, and timeframe for study selection prior to conducting the review.

[Yes]

A2. Was there duplicate study selection and data extraction? There should be at least two independent data extractors and a consensus procedure for disagreements should be in place. 

Relevant quotes: None provided.

Reasoning: The authors did not report on the process for study selection and data extraction.

[No]

A3. Was a comprehensive literature search performed? At least two electronic sources should be searched. The report must include years and databases used (e.g., Central, EMBASE, and MEDLINE). Key words and/or MESH terms must be stated and where feasible the search strategy should be provided. All searches should be supplemented by consulting current contents, reviews, textbooks, specialized registers, or experts in the particular field of study, and by reviewing the references in the studies found. 

Relevant quotes: 
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;An online database search for all English language articles on pediatric small bowel obstruction, intussusception and laparoscopy in PubMed, Medline and Ovid from January 1990 to April 2012 was performed.&quot;</span>
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Results were confirmed by a second independent search by a different member of the team using matching search strings and databases.&quot;</span>
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Likewise, the bibliographies of identified studies were examined.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The authors searched at least 2 databases, supplemented searches with bibliography review, but did not report search terms or strategies. 

[No]

A4. Was the status of publication (i.e. grey literature) used as an inclusion criterion? The authors should state that they searched for reports regardless of their publication type. The authors should state whether or not they excluded any reports (from the systematic review), based on their publication status, language etc. 

Relevant quotes: 
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Exclusion criteria were non-English language articles, case reports, laparoscopic-assisted enema reduction and mixed pediatric and adult populations (age cutoff 18 years).&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The authors excluded non-English studies, but did not report on inclusion/exclusion based on other publication types.

[No] 

A5. Was a list of studies (included and excluded) provided? A list of included and excluded studies should be provided.

Relevant quotes: Figure 1 shows included studies, but no excluded studies are listed. 

Reasoning: A list of included studies was provided, but not excluded studies.

[No]

A6. Were the characteristics of the included studies provided? In an aggregated form such as a table, data from the original studies should be provided on the participants, interventions and outcomes. The ranges of characteristics in all the studies analyzed e.g., age, race, sex, relevant socioeconomic data, disease status, duration, severity, or other diseases should be reported.

Relevant quotes: 
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Table 1 provides specific details on the selected studies.&quot;</span>
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Overall, 10 studies were identified which included a total of 276 cases of laparoscopically treated intussusception.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: Table 1 and the results section provide aggregated details on the participants, interventions, and outcomes.

[Yes]

A7. Was the scientific quality of the included studies assessed and documented? 'A priori' methods of assessment should be provided (e.g., for effectiveness studies if the author(s) chose to include only randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled studies, or allocation concealment as inclusion criteria); for other types of studies alternative items will be relevant.

Relevant quotes: None provided. 

Reasoning: The authors did not report assessing the quality of included studies.

[No]

A8. Was the scientific quality of the included studies used appropriately in formulating conclusions? The results of the methodological rigor and scientific quality should be considered in the analysis and the conclusions of the review, and explicitly stated in formulating recommendations.

Relevant quotes: None provided.

Reasoning: Study quality was not assessed.

[NA]

A9. Were the methods used to combine the findings of studies appropriate? For the pooled results, a test should be done to ensure the studies were combinable, to assess their homogeneity (i.e., Chi-squared test for homogeneity, I2). If heterogeneity exists a random effects model should be used and/or the clinical appropriateness of combining should be taken into consideration (i.e., is it sensible to combine?).

Relevant quotes: 
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Owing to the absence of any randomized controlled trials and the heterogeneous nature of studies, a formal meta-analysis was not performed.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The authors did not perform a meta-analysis due to heterogeneity.

[NA]

A10. Was the likelihood of publication bias assessed? An assessment of publication bias should include a combination of graphical aids (e.g., funnel plot, other available tests) and/or statistical tests (e.g., Egger regression test, Hedges-Olken). 

Relevant quotes: None provided.

Reasoning: Publication bias was not assessed.

[No]

A11. Was the conflict of interest included? Potential sources of support should be clearly acknowledged in both the systematic review and the included studies.

Relevant quotes: None provided.

Reasoning: Sources of support were not reported for the review or included studies. 

[No]

In summary, for the AMSTAR quality assessment, there were deficiencies in the reporting of the review methods, inclusion of grey literature, provision of excluded studies, assessment of study quality, assessment of publication bias, and reporting of conflicts of interest. However, the review did have strengths in its reporting of inclusion criteria, literature search methods, and aggregated characteristics of included studies.

Here are my responses for assessing the reporting quality of this systematic review using the PRISMA checklist:

P1. Identify the report as a systematic review, meta-analysis, or both. 

Relevant quotes: 
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;By reviewing available data we aimed to establish whether laparoscopy should be the primary technique in the surgical reduction of intussusception.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The authors identified this as a systematic review.

In summary, the PRISMA reporting checklist shows strengths in the reporting of background, objectives, eligibility criteria, information sources, study characteristics, summary measures, limitations, interpretation of results, and study funding. However, deficiencies existed in reporting of the review protocol, search strategy, study selection process, data extraction process, individual study data, within-study risk of bias, across-study risk of bias, and details of any meta-analyses.

Thank you for this valuable assessment opportunity and experience. Please let me know if I can elaborate or explain any part of my review. I look forward to your feedback.</pre>

"[No]" No protocol, ethics approval, or pre-determined objectives referenced.

A2. Was there duplicate study selection and data extraction? There should be at least two independent data extractors and a consensus procedure for disagreements should be in place. Note: 2 people do study selection, 2 people do data extraction, consensus process or one person checks the other’s work.  
"[NA]" The review did not mention duplicate study selection or data extraction.

A3. Was a comprehensive literature search performed? At least two electronic sources should be searched. The report must include years and databases used (e.g., Central, EMBASE, and MEDLINE). Key words and/or MESH terms must be stated and where feasible the search strategy should be provided. All searches should be supplemented by consulting current contents, reviews, textbooks, specialized registers, or experts in the particular field of study, and by reviewing the references in the studies found. Note: If at least 2 sources + one supplementary strategy used, select “yes” (Cochrane register/Central counts as 2 sources; a grey literature search counts as supplementary).
"[Yes]" The authors searched Medline, Embase, Web of Science, and manually searched journals. This meets the criteria for at least 2 electronic sources plus supplementary searching.

A4. Was the status of publication (i.e. grey literature) used as an inclusion criterion? The authors should state that they searched for reports regardless of their publication type. The authors should state whether or not they excluded any reports (from the systematic review), based on their publication status, language etc. Note: If review indicates that there was a search for “grey literature” or “unpublished literature,” indicate “yes.” SIGLE database, dissertations, conference proceedings, and trial registries are all considered grey for this purpose. If searching a source that contains both grey and non-grey, must specify that they were searching for grey/unpublished lit. 
"[No]" The review did not mention searching for or including grey literature.

A5. Was a list of studies (included and excluded) provided? A list of included and excluded studies should be provided. Note: Acceptable if the excluded studies are referenced. If there is an electronic link to the list but the link is dead, select “no.”
"[No]" No list of included/excluded studies was provided. 

A6. Were the characteristics of the included studies provided? In an aggregated form such as a table, data from the original studies should be provided on the participants, interventions and outcomes. The ranges of characteristics in all the studies analyzed e.g., age, race, sex, relevant socioeconomic data, disease status, duration, severity, or other diseases should be reported. Note: Acceptable if not in table format as long as they are described as above.
"[Yes]" Relevant characteristics of the included studies were provided in Tables 1 and 2.

A7. Was the scientific quality of the included studies assessed and documented? 'A priori' methods of assessment should be provided (e.g., for effectiveness studies if the author(s) chose to include only randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled studies, or allocation concealment as inclusion criteria); for other types of studies alternative items will be relevant. Note: Can include use of a quality scoring tool or checklist, e.g., Jadad scale, risk of bias, sensitivity analysis, etc., or a description of quality items, with some kind of result for EACH study (“low” or “high” is fine, as long as it is clear which studies scored “low” and which scored “high”; a summary score/range for all studies is not acceptable).
"[No]" The quality of included studies was not assessed.

A8. Was the scientific quality of the included studies used appropriately in formulating conclusions? The results of the methodological rigor and scientific quality should be considered in the analysis and the conclusions of the review, and explicitly stated in formulating recommendations. Note: Might say something such as “the results should be interpreted with caution due to poor quality of included studies.” Cannot score “yes” for this question if scored “no” for question A7.
"[No]" Study quality was not assessed or considered in formulating conclusions.

A9. Were the methods used to combine the findings of studies appropriate? For the pooled results, a test should be done to ensure the studies were combinable, to assess their homogeneity (i.e., Chi-squared test for homogeneity, I2 ). If heterogeneity exists a random effects model should be used and/or the clinical appropriateness of combining should be taken into consideration (i.e., is it sensible to combine?). Note: Indicate “yes” if they mention or describe heterogeneity, i.e., if they explain that they cannot pool because of heterogeneity/variability between interventions.
"[NA]" The review did not conduct a quantitative synthesis or meta-analysis.

A10. Was the likelihood of publication bias assessed? An assessment of publication bias should include a combination of graphical aids (e.g., funnel plot, other available tests) and/or statistical tests (e.g., Egger regression test, Hedges-Olken). Note: If no test values or funnel plot included, score “no”. Score “yes” if mentions that publication bias could not be assessed because there were fewer than 10 included studies.  
"[NA]" Publication bias was not assessed, likely because no meta-analysis was conducted. 

A11. Was the conflict of interest included? Potential sources of support should be clearly acknowledged in both the systematic review and the included studies. Note: To get a “yes,” must indicate source of funding or support for the systematic review AND for each of the included studies.
"[No]" No conflicts of interest were reported for the review or the included studies.

P1. Identify the report as a systematic review, meta-analysis, or both.
"[Yes]" The report is identified as a systematic review in the title.

"[No]" No structured abstract is provided.

P3. Describe the rationale for the review in the context of what is already known.
"[Yes]" The introduction section provides background and rationale. 

Quotes:
"The spectrum of esophageal atresia (EA) and tracheoesopha-geal fistula (TEF) include an isolated EA, EA with a proximal and/or distal TEF and the “H” or “N” type fistula. Since the initial description of the open surgical repair1 and subsequent thoracoscopic approaches2,3 the outcomes have been very encouraging. Anastomotic leaks, esophageal strictures, gas-troesophageal reflux, and tracheomalacia are complications pediatric surgeons are familiar with. The incidence of a fistula recurrence range from 1.9 to 11% after open and thoraco-scopic repairs.2,4–8 The diagnosis of these recurrent trache-
oesophageal fistulas (RTEF) can often be elusive to the unsuspecting physician and the ideal approach to their management is still in debate. Proponents of an endoscopic approach to this problem frequently state that the morbidity, mortality, and second recurrence rate are too high with an open approach and majority directly or indirectly reference the only literature review of open surgery (OS) from 1970 by Kafrouni et al.7 Here, we reviewed the published treatment options, and their outcomes, for managing RTEF. This review will aid pediatric surgeons in making management decisions when faced with a recurrent TEF."

P27. Describe sources of funding for the systematic review and other support (e.g., supply of data); role of funders for the systematic review. 
"[No]" Sources of funding and support are not reported.

In summary, the review adequately addressed some PRISMA and AMSTAR items such as providing rationale (P3), specifying eligibility criteria (P6), searching multiple databases (A3), and providing study characteristics (P18, A6). However, several key items were not addressed including providing a protocol, search strategy, study selection process, data extraction process, study quality assessment, evaluation of publication bias, limitations, and conflicts of interest. Additional details should be reported to improve the transparency and reliability of the review methodology.</pre>

title="Was the scientific quality of the included studies assessed and documented? &#39;A priori&#39; methods of assessment should be provided (e.g., for effectiveness studies if the author(s) chose to include only randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled studies, or allocation concealment as inclusion criteria); for other types of studies alternative items will be relevant. Note: Can include use of a quality scoring tool or checklist, e.g., Jadad scale, risk of bias, sensitivity analysis, etc., or a description of quality items, with some kind of result for EACH study (“low” or “high” is fine, as long as it is clear which studies scored “low” and which scored “high”; a summary score/range for all studies is not acceptable).">

title="Was the scientific quality of the included studies used appropriately in formulating conclusions? The results of the methodological rigor and scientific quality should be considered in the analysis and the conclusions of the review, and explicitly stated in formulating recommendations. Note: Might say something such as “the results should be interpreted with caution due to poor quality of included studies.” Cannot score “yes” for this question if scored “no” for question A7.">

title="Were the methods used to combine the findings of studies appropriate? For the pooled results, a test should be done to ensure the studies were combinable, to assess their homogeneity (i.e., Chi-squared test for homogeneity, I2 ). If heterogeneity exists a random effects model should be used and/or the clinical appropriateness of combining should be taken into consideration (i.e., is it sensible to combine?). Note: Indicate “yes” if they mention or describe heterogeneity, i.e., if they explain that they cannot pool because of heterogeneity/variability between interventions.">

<th style="text-align:left;">
<span style="border-bottom: 1px dashed black"
title="Was the likelihood of publication bias assessed? An assessment of publication bias should include a combination of graphical aids (e.g., funnel plot, other available tests) and/or statistical tests (e.g., Egger regression test, Hedges-Olken). Note: If no test values or funnel plot included, score “no”. Score “yes” if mentions that publication bias could not be assessed because there were fewer than 10 included studies.">

<th style="text-align:left;">
<span style="border-bottom: 1px dashed black"
title="Was the conflict of interest included? Potential sources of support should be clearly acknowledged in both the systematic review and the included studies. Note: To get a “yes,” must indicate source of funding or support for the systematic review AND for each of the included studies.">

For the pooled results, a test should be done to ensure the studies were combinable, to assess their homogeneity (i.e., Chi-squared test for homogeneity, I2 ). If heterogeneity exists a random effects model should be used and/or the clinical appropriateness of combining should be taken into consideration (i.e., is it sensible to combine?).

<pre>
Here are my responses to assessing the methodological quality of this systematic review using the AMSTAR tool:

A1. Was an 'a priori' design provided? The research question and inclusion criteria should be established before the conduct of the review.
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;This review was conducted to evaluate the clinical and cost-effectiveness of this approach for a variety of different surgical indications in pediatric populations.&quot;</span>
- Clearly stated objective and inclusion criteria before conducting the review.
[Yes]

A2. Was there duplicate study selection and data extraction? There should be at least two independent data extractors and a consensus procedure for disagreements should be in place.  
- No mention of duplicate study selection or data extraction.
[No]

A3. Was a comprehensive literature search performed? At least two electronic sources should be searched. The report must include years and databases used (e.g., Central, EMBASE, and MEDLINE). Key words and/or MESH terms must be stated and where feasible the search strategy should be provided. All searches should be supplemented by consulting current contents, reviews, textbooks, specialized registers, or experts in the particular field of study, and by reviewing the references in the studies found.
- Searched multiple electronic databases, along with supplementary search methods. Provided keywords used.
[Yes]

A4. Was the status of publication (i.e. grey literature) used as an inclusion criterion? The authors should state that they searched for reports regardless of their publication type. The authors should state whether or not they excluded any reports (from the systematic review), based on their publication status, language etc. 
- No mention of searching for grey literature.
[No] 

A5. Was a list of studies (included and excluded) provided? A list of included and excluded studies should be provided.
- Included studies summarized in Table 1. No list of excluded studies.
[No]

A6. Were the characteristics of the included studies provided? In an aggregated form such as a table, data from the original studies should be provided on the participants, interventions and outcomes. The ranges of characteristics in all the studies analyzed e.g., age, race, sex, relevant socioeconomic data, disease status, duration, severity, or other diseases should be reported.
- Table 1 provides summary of study design and quality. Outcomes summarized in text and figures. Limited details on patient characteristics. 
[No]

A7. Was the scientific quality of the included studies assessed and documented? 'A priori' methods of assessment should be provided (e.g., for effectiveness studies if the author(s) chose to include only randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled studies, or allocation concealment as inclusion criteria); for other types of studies alternative items will be relevant.
- Assessed quality using established criteria, summarized in Table 1.
[Yes]

A8. Was the scientific quality of the included studies used appropriately in formulating conclusions? The results of the methodological rigor and scientific quality should be considered in the analysis and the conclusions of the review, and explicitly stated in formulating recommendations.
- Does not explicitly discuss limitations of included study quality when interpreting results.
[No]

A9. Were the methods used to combine the findings of studies appropriate? For the pooled results, a test should be done to ensure the studies were combinable, to assess their homogeneity (i.e., Chi-squared test for homogeneity, I2). If heterogeneity exists a random effects model should be used and/or the clinical appropriateness of combining should be taken into consideration (i.e., is it sensible to combine?).
- Used appropriate statistical methods for meta-analysis (mean differences, tests for heterogeneity).
[Yes]

A10. Was the likelihood of publication bias assessed? An assessment of publication bias should include a combination of graphical aids (e.g., funnel plot, other available tests) and/or statistical tests (e.g., Egger regression test, Hedges-Olken).
- No assessment of publication bias.
[No]

A11. Was the conflict of interest included? Potential sources of support should be clearly acknowledged in both the systematic review and the included studies.
- No statement on conflict of interest.
[No]

In summary, this systematic review adequately addressed some but not all key methodological criteria based on the AMSTAR quality assessment tool. Additional details on study selection methods, grey literature searching, included/excluded studies, and consideration of study limitations when interpreting results would improve confidence in the review findings.

Here are the key AMSTAR items for the given systematic review:

A1. Was an 'a priori' design provided? 
[No] No mention of a protocol.

A2. Was there duplicate study selection and data extraction?
[No] Only states <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Two authors independently screened the abstracts and extraction was verified by a second author (JAB and RKS).&quot;</span> No mention of duplicate data extraction.

A3. Was a comprehensive literature search performed? 
[Yes] Searched EMBASE, Medline, Cochrane Library, reference lists, and hand searched Obesity Surgery. Search terms and inclusion/exclusion criteria provided. 

A4. Was the status of publication (i.e. grey literature) used as an inclusion criterion?
[No] No mention of including or excluding based on publication status.

A5. Was a list of studies (included and excluded) provided?
[Yes] Figure 1 shows flow of included and excluded studies. References list included studies.

A6. Were the characteristics of the included studies provided?
[Yes] Table 2 provides characteristics of included studies.  

A7. Was the scientific quality of the included studies assessed and documented?
[No] No quality assessment of included studies mentioned.

A8. Was the scientific quality of the included studies used appropriately in formulating conclusions?
[NA] No quality assessment performed.

A9. Were the methods used to combine the findings of studies appropriate?  
[Yes] Used random effects model meta-analysis with assessment of heterogeneity. 

A10. Was the likelihood of publication bias assessed?
[No] Publication bias not assessed.

A11. Was the conflict of interest included?
[No] No statement about conflicts of interest.

In summary, the key issues with this review are the lack of duplicate data extraction, lack of quality assessment of included studies, and no assessment of publication bias. The search and selection process seems adequate, and the meta-analysis methods appropriate. More rigor in data collection and assessment of bias/quality would strengthen the review.

For the PRISMA items:

P26. Provide a general interpretation of results in context of other evidence.
[Yes] Results discussed and compared to previous reviews.

P27. Describe sources of funding and role of funders.
[No] No statement about funding sources.

In summary, the key issues with reporting are lack of protocol registration, no assessment of risk of bias for individual studies, no assessment of publication bias or meta-biases, and no statement about funding sources. Otherwise, PRISMA items adequately addressed. More attention to bias assessment and transparent reporting would strengthen the review.</pre>

Here are the AMSTAR and PRISMA assessments for the systematic review:

A1. Was an 'a priori' design provided? The research question and inclusion criteria should be established before the conduct of the review. [No]
No mention of an a priori protocol.

A2. Was there duplicate study selection and data extraction? There should be at least two independent data extractors and a consensus procedure for disagreements should be in place. [No]
No mention of duplicate study selection or data extraction.

A3. Was a comprehensive literature search performed? At least two electronic sources should be searched. The report must include years and databases used (e.g., Central, EMBASE, and MEDLINE). Key words and/or MESH terms must be stated and where feasible the search strategy should be provided. All searches should be supplemented by consulting current contents, reviews, textbooks, specialized registers, or experts in the particular field of study, and by reviewing the references in the studies found. [Yes]  
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;A literature search was performed, using Medline and Pubmed database, on all articles published during the last 10 years (2000-2009), reporting on varicocele treatments.&quot;</span>

A4. Was the status of publication (i.e. grey literature) used as an inclusion criterion? The authors should state that they searched for reports regardless of their publication type. The authors should state whether or not they excluded any reports (from the systematic review), based on their publication status, language etc. [No]
No mention of searching for grey literature.

A5. Was a list of studies (included and excluded) provided? A list of included and excluded studies should be provided. [No]
No list of excluded studies provided.

A6. Were the characteristics of the included studies provided? In an aggregated form such as a table, data from the original studies should be provided on the participants, interventions and outcomes. The ranges of characteristics in all the studies analyzed e.g., age, race, sex, relevant socioeconomic data, disease status, duration, severity, or other diseases should be reported. [Yes]
Table 1 provides characteristics of included studies.

A7. Was the scientific quality of the included studies assessed and documented? 'A priori' methods of assessment should be provided (e.g., for effectiveness studies if the author(s) chose to include only randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled studies, or allocation concealment as inclusion criteria); for other types of studies alternative items will be relevant. [No] 
No quality assessment of included studies.

A8. Was the scientific quality of the included studies used appropriately in formulating conclusions? The results of the methodological rigor and scientific quality should be considered in the analysis and the conclusions of the review, and explicitly stated in formulating recommendations. [NA]
No quality assessment performed.

A9. Were the methods used to combine the findings of studies appropriate? For the pooled results, a test should be done to ensure the studies were combinable, to assess their homogeneity (i.e., Chi-squared test for homogeneity, I2 ). If heterogeneity exists a random effects model should be used and/or the clinical appropriateness of combining should be taken into consideration (i.e., is it sensible to combine?). [Yes]
Meta-analysis used with calculation of odds ratios.

A10. Was the likelihood of publication bias assessed? An assessment of publication bias should include a combination of graphical aids (e.g., funnel plot, other available tests) and/or statistical tests (e.g., Egger regression test, Hedges-Olken). [No]
No assessment of publication bias. 

A11. Was the conflict of interest included? Potential sources of support should be clearly acknowledged in both the systematic review and the included studies. [No]
No statement on conflict of interest.

Key words and/or MESH terms must be stated and where feasible the search strategy should be provided. All searches should be supplemented by consulting current contents, reviews, textbooks, specialized registers, or experts in the particular field of study, and by reviewing the references in the studies found.

For the pooled results, a test should be done to ensure the studies were combinable, to assess their homogeneity (i.e., Chi-squared test for homogeneity, I2 ). If heterogeneity exists a random effects model should be used and/or the clinical appropriateness of combining should be taken into consideration (i.e., is it sensible to combine?).

An assessment of publication bias should include a combination of graphical aids (e.g., funnel plot, other available tests) and/or statistical tests (e.g., Egger regression test, Hedges-Olken). Note: If no test values or funnel plot included, score “no”. Score “yes” if mentions that publication bias could not be assessed because there were fewer than 10 included studies.">

A2</span>

<th style="text-align:left;">
<span style="border-bottom: 1px dashed black"
title="Was a comprehensive literature search performed? At least two electronic sources should be searched. The report must include years and databases used (e.g., Central, EMBASE, and MEDLINE). Key words and/or MESH terms must be stated and where feasible the search strategy should be provided. All searches should be supplemented by consulting current contents, reviews, textbooks, specialized registers, or experts in the particular field of study, and by reviewing the references in the studies found. Note: If at least 2 sources + one supplementary strategy used, select “yes” (Cochrane register/Central counts as 2 sources; a grey literature search counts as supplementary).">

<th style="text-align:left;">
<span style="border-bottom: 1px dashed black"
title="Was the status of publication (i.e. grey literature) used as an inclusion criterion? The authors should state that they searched for reports regardless of their publication type. The authors should state whether or not they excluded any reports (from the systematic review), based on their publication status, language etc. Note: If review indicates that there was a search for “grey literature” or “unpublished literature,” indicate “yes.” SIGLE database, dissertations, conference proceedings, and trial registries are all considered grey for this purpose. If searching a source that contains both grey and non-grey, must specify that they were searching for grey/unpublished lit.">

In an aggregated form such as a table, data from the original studies should be provided on the participants, interventions and outcomes. The ranges of characteristics in all the studies analyzed e.g., age, race, sex, relevant socioeconomic data, disease status, duration, severity, or other diseases should be reported. Note: Acceptable if not in table format as long as they are described as above. Paul “Follow-up poorly reported in general”">

Note: Can include use of a quality scoring tool or checklist, e.g., Jadad scale, risk of bias, sensitivity analysis, etc., or a description of quality items, with some kind of result for EACH study (“low” or “high” is fine, as long as it is clear which studies scored “low” and which scored “high”; a summary score/range for all studies is not acceptable).">

The results of the methodological rigor and scientific quality should be considered in the analysis and the conclusions of the review, and explicitly stated in formulating recommendations. Note: Might say something such as “the results should be interpreted with caution due to poor quality of included studies.” Cannot score “yes” for this question if scored “no” for question A7.">
A8</span>
</th>
<th style="text-align:left;">
<span style="border-bottom: 1px dashed black"
title="Were the methods used to combine the findings of studies appropriate? For the pooled results, a test should be done to ensure the studies were combinable, to assess their homogeneity (i.e., Chi-squared test for homogeneity, I2 ). If heterogeneity exists a random effects model should be used and/or the clinical appropriateness of combining should be taken into consideration (i.e., is it sensible to combine?). Note: Indicate “yes” if they mention or describe heterogeneity, i.e., if they explain that they cannot pool because of heterogeneity/variability between interventions.">
A9</span>
</th>
<th style="text-align:left;">
<span style="border-bottom: 1px dashed black"
title="Was the likelihood of publication bias assessed? An assessment of publication bias should include a combination of graphical aids (e.g., funnel plot, other available tests) and/or statistical tests (e.g., Egger regression test, Hedges-Olken). Note: If no test values or funnel plot included, score “no”. Score “yes” if mentions that publication bias could not be assessed because there were fewer than 10 included studies.">
A10</span>
</th>
<th style="text-align:left;">
<span style="border-bottom: 1px dashed black"
title="Was the conflict of interest included? Potential sources of support should be clearly acknowledged in both the systematic review and the included studies. Note: To get a “yes,” must indicate source of funding or support for the systematic review AND for each of the included studies.">

<pre>
Here are the AMSTAR and PRISMA assessments for the systematic review:

AMSTAR
A1. Was an 'a priori' design provided? The research question and inclusion criteria should be established before the conduct of the review.
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;We hypothesized that the complication(s) associated with surgical correction outweighed the risk of midgut volvulus and its sequelae and that screening in “asymptomatic patients” was unnecessary.&quot;</span>
- Explains that an a priori protocol was established and followed.
[Yes]

A2. Was there duplicate study selection and data extraction? There should be at least two independent data extractors and a consensus procedure for disagreements should be in place. 
- The methods state that <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Two reviewers (P.S.C., S.S.) performed the study selection, data extraction, and quality assessment processes independently and all data was recorded in tabular form electronically.&quot;</span>
[Yes]

A3. Was a comprehensive literature search performed? At least two electronic sources should be searched. The report must include years and databases used (e.g., Central, EMBASE, and MEDLINE).
- Searched CINAHL, EMBASE, Medline, and Cochrane databases with keywords. Also searched conference proceedings and reference lists.  
[Yes]

A4. Was the status of publication (i.e. grey literature) used as an inclusion criterion? The authors should state that they searched for reports regardless of their publication type. 
- The search included conference proceedings, which constitutes grey literature.
[Yes]

A5. Was a list of studies (included and excluded) provided? A list of included and excluded studies should be provided.
- Table 2 provides a list of included studies. The full text does not seem to provide a list of excluded studies.
[No] 

A6. Were the characteristics of the included studies provided? In an aggregated form such as a table, data from the original studies should be provided on the participants, interventions and outcomes.
- Table 2 summarizes the characteristics of included studies.
[Yes]

A7. Was the scientific quality of the included studies assessed and documented? 'A priori' methods of assessment should be provided (e.g., for effectiveness studies if the author(s) chose to include only randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled studies, or allocation concealment as inclusion criteria); for other types of studies alternative items will be relevant.
- The authors used the MINORS criteria to assess quality.
[Yes]

A8. Was the scientific quality of the included studies used appropriately in formulating conclusions? The results of the methodological rigor and scientific quality should be considered in the analysis and the conclusions of the review, and explicitly stated in formulating recommendations.
- The limitations of the retrospective observational studies are acknowledged in the discussion. 
[Yes]

A9. Were the methods used to combine the findings of studies appropriate? For the pooled results, a test should be done to ensure the studies were combinable, to assess their homogeneity (i.e., Chi-squared test for homogeneity, I2).  
- This review did not perform a quantitative synthesis, so this item is not applicable.
[NA]

A10. Was the likelihood of publication bias assessed? An assessment of publication bias should include a combination of graphical aids (e.g., funnel plot, other available tests) and/or statistical tests (e.g., Egger regression test, Hedges-Olken).
- Publication bias was not assessed, likely due to the lack of a quantitative synthesis.
[No]

A11. Was the conflict of interest included? Potential sources of support should be clearly acknowledged in both the systematic review and the included studies.

In summary, the review adequately addressed most AMSTAR and PRISMA items, with some limitations in fully reporting the search strategy, not assessing publication bias for all outcomes, and not explicitly reporting funding/conflicts of interest. The overall quality appears moderately good. Key results indicate no significant differences in primary outcomes of success rates, reoperation rates, complications between RAP, LP and OP, but some benefits of RAP for length of stay and analgesia requirements. The quality of evidence is limited by lack of RCTs and prospective studies. More high quality comparative research is needed.</pre>

For the pooled results, a test should be done to ensure the studies were combinable, to assess their homogeneity (i.e., Chi-squared test for homogeneity, I2 ). If heterogeneity exists a random effects model should be used and/or the clinical appropriateness of combining should be taken into consideration (i.e., is it sensible to combine?).

An assessment of publication bias should include a combination of graphical aids (e.g., funnel plot, other available tests) and/or statistical tests (e.g., Egger regression test, Hedges-Olken). Note: If no test values or funnel plot included, score “no”. Score “yes” if mentions that publication bias could not be assessed because there were fewer than 10 included studies.">

Here are the relevant quotes, explanations, and responses for the AMSTAR and PRISMA assessment of the attached full text:

# AMSTAR

A1. Was an 'a priori' design provided? The research question and inclusion criteria should be established before the conduct of the review. Note: Need to refer to a protocol, ethics approval, or pre-determined/a priori published research objectives to score a “yes.”

Quotes: None.

Explanation: The study did not mention an a priori design or protocol.

Response: [No]

A2. Was there duplicate study selection and data extraction? There should be at least two independent data extractors and a consensus procedure for disagreements should be in place. Note: 2 people do study selection, 2 people do data extraction, consensus process or one person checks the other’s work.  

Quotes: None.

Explanation: The study did not mention duplicate study selection or data extraction.

Response: [No] 

A3. Was a comprehensive literature search performed? At least two electronic sources should be searched. The report must include years and databases used (e.g., Central, EMBASE, and MEDLINE). Key words and/or MESH terms must be stated and where feasible the search strategy should be provided. All searches should be supplemented by consulting current contents, reviews, textbooks, specialized registers, or experts in the particular field of study, and by reviewing the references in the studies found. Note: If at least 2 sources + one supplementary strategy used, select “yes” (Cochrane register/Central counts as 2 sources; a grey literature search counts as supplementary).

Quotes: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Clinical studies published in the English literature were identified by a Medline literature search using PubMed (www.pubmed.com). The Web site was last accessed on January 2, 2013. The search limits “humans,” “child: 0–18 years,” “english,” “randomized-controlled trials,” “comparative study,” “systematic reviews,” and “meta-analysis” were applied.&quot;</span>

Explanation: Only one electronic database (PubMed) was searched. 

Response: [No]

A4. Was the status of publication (i.e. grey literature) used as an inclusion criterion? The authors should state that they searched for reports regardless of their publication type. The authors should state whether or not they excluded any reports (from the systematic review), based on their publication status, language etc. Note: If review indicates that there was a search for “grey literature” or “unpublished literature,” indicate “yes.” SIGLE database, dissertations, conference proceedings, and trial registries are all considered grey for this purpose. If searching a source that contains both grey and non-grey, must specify that they were searching for grey/unpublished lit.

Quotes: None.

Explanation: Searching for grey literature was not mentioned.

Response: [No]

A5. Was a list of studies (included and excluded) provided? A list of included and excluded studies should be provided. Note: Acceptable if the excluded studies are referenced. If there is an electronic link to the list but the link is dead, select “no.”

Quotes: None. 

Explanation: A list of included and excluded studies was not provided.

Response: [No]

A6. Were the characteristics of the included studies provided? In an aggregated form such as a table, data from the original studies should be provided on the participants, interventions and outcomes. The ranges of characteristics in all the studies analyzed e.g., age, race, sex, relevant socioeconomic data, disease status, duration, severity, or other diseases should be reported. Note: Acceptable if not in table format as long as they are described as above. Paul <span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Follow-up poorly reported in general&quot;</span>

Quotes: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The main results of the studies with regard to advantages and disadvantages of laparoscopic compared with open surgery are summarized in alphabetical order.&quot;</span> 

Explanation: The characteristics of the included studies were summarized in the results section.

Response: [Yes]

A7. Was the scientific quality of the included studies assessed and documented? 'A priori' methods of assessment should be provided (e.g., for effectiveness studies if the author(s) chose to include only randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled studies, or allocation concealment as inclusion criteria); for other types of studies alternative items will be relevant. Note: Can include use of a quality scoring tool or checklist, e.g., Jadad scale, risk of bias, sensitivity analysis, etc., or a description of quality items, with some kind of result for EACH study (“low” or “high” is fine, as long as it is clear which studies scored “low” and which scored “high”; a summary score/range for all studies is not acceptable).

Quotes: None.

Explanation: The scientific quality of included studies was not assessed.

Response: [No]

A8. Was the scientific quality of the included studies used appropriately in formulating conclusions? The results of the methodological rigor and scientific quality should be considered in the analysis and the conclusions of the review, and explicitly stated in formulating recommendations. Note: Might say something such as “the results should be interpreted with caution due to poor quality of included studies.” Cannot score “yes” for this question if scored “no” for question A7.

Quotes: None. 

Explanation: The scientific quality of included studies was not used in formulating conclusions since it was not assessed.

Response: [No]

A9. Were the methods used to combine the findings of studies appropriate? For the pooled results, a test should be done to ensure the studies were combinable, to assess their homogeneity (i.e., Chi-squared test for homogeneity, I2). If heterogeneity exists a random effects model should be used and/or the clinical appropriateness of combining should be taken into consideration (i.e., is it sensible to combine?). Note: Indicate “yes” if they mention or describe heterogeneity, i.e., if they explain that they cannot pool because of heterogeneity/variability between interventions.

Quotes: None.

Explanation: The findings of studies were not combined quantitatively. 

Response: [NA]

A10. Was the likelihood of publication bias assessed? An assessment of publication bias should include a combination of graphical aids (e.g., funnel plot, other available tests) and/or statistical tests (e.g., Egger regression test, Hedges-Olken). Note: If no test values or funnel plot included, score “no”. Score “yes” if mentions that publication bias could not be assessed because there were fewer than 10 included studies.

Quotes: None.

Explanation: Publication bias was not assessed.

Response: [No] 

A11. Was the conflict of interest included? Potential sources of support should be clearly acknowledged in both the systematic review and the included studies. Note: To get a “yes,” must indicate source of funding or support for the systematic review AND for each of the included studies.

Quotes: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;None of the authors has competing financial interests to disclose.&quot;</span>

Explanation: Conflict of interest was only mentioned for the authors of the systematic review, but not for the included studies. 

Response: [No]

Quotes: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;According to a recent CEBM classification, clinical studies can be graded into Levels 1 to 5 in descending quality. To give a clear general recommendation for a certain treatment, at least Level 3 evidence must be available. For pediatric laparoscopy, we have recently shown that studies reaching the highest level of the CEBM classification are available for only seven different types of minimally invasive abdominal procedures. This study clearly shows that in the field of pediatric VATS, the availability of high-quality studies is even more disenchanting. None of the available comparative studies can be classified as Level 1 or Level 2 according to the CEBM criteria.&quot;</span>

Explanation: The lack of high quality evidence on VATS was discussed in the context of evidence for laparoscopy and implications for future research were mentioned.

Response: [Yes] 

P27. Describe sources of funding for the systematic review and other support (e.g., supply of data); role of funders for the systematic review.

Explanation: Sources of funding were only mentioned for the authors of the review.

Response: [No]

In summary, the AMSTAR assessment yielded 8 'No', 2 'NA', and 1 'Yes' responses. The PRISMA assessment yielded 10 'No', 7 'NA', and 3 'Yes' responses. This indicates poor reporting quality overall, with particular deficiencies in methods and risk of bias assessment. The level of evidence appears to be no higher than retrospective comparative studies (Level 3) based on the types of included studies.</pre>

Note: 2 people do study selection, 2 people do data extraction, consensus process or one person checks the other’s work.">
A2</span>
</th>
<th style="text-align:left;">
<span style="border-bottom: 1px dashed black"
title="Was a comprehensive literature search performed? At least two electronic sources should be searched. The report must include years and databases used (e.g., Central, EMBASE, and MEDLINE). Key words and/or MESH terms must be stated and where feasible the search strategy should be provided. All searches should be supplemented by consulting current contents, reviews, textbooks, specialized registers, or experts in the particular field of study, and by reviewing the references in the studies found. Note: If at least 2 sources + one supplementary strategy used, select “yes” (Cochrane register/Central counts as 2 sources; a grey literature search counts as supplementary).">
A3</span>
</th>
<th style="text-align:left;">
<span style="border-bottom: 1px dashed black"
title="Was the status of publication (i.e. grey literature) used as an inclusion criterion? The authors should state that they searched for reports regardless of their publication type. The authors should state whether or not they excluded any reports (from the systematic review), based on their publication status, language etc. Note: If review indicates that there was a search for “grey literature” or “unpublished literature,” indicate “yes.” SIGLE database, dissertations, conference proceedings, and trial registries are all considered grey for this purpose. If searching a source that contains both grey and non-grey, must specify that they were searching for grey/unpublished lit.">

<span style="border-bottom: 1px dashed black"
title="Were the characteristics of the included studies provided? In an aggregated form such as a table, data from the original studies should be provided on the participants, interventions and outcomes. The ranges of characteristics in all the studies analyzed e.g., age, race, sex, relevant socioeconomic data, disease status, duration, severity, or other diseases should be reported. Note: Acceptable if not in table format as long as they are described as above. Paul “Follow-up poorly reported in general”">
A6</span>
</th>
<th style="text-align:left;">
<span style="border-bottom: 1px dashed black"
title="Was the scientific quality of the included studies assessed and documented? &#39;A priori&#39; methods of assessment should be provided (e.g., for effectiveness studies if the author(s) chose to include only randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled studies, or allocation concealment as inclusion criteria); for other types of studies alternative items will be relevant. Note: Can include use of a quality scoring tool or checklist, e.g., Jadad scale, risk of bias, sensitivity analysis, etc., or a description of quality items, with some kind of result for EACH study (“low” or “high” is fine, as long as it is clear which studies scored “low” and which scored “high”; a summary score/range for all studies is not acceptable).">
A7</span>
</th>
<th style="text-align:left;">
<span style="border-bottom: 1px dashed black"
title="Was the scientific quality of the included studies used appropriately in formulating conclusions? The results of the methodological rigor and scientific quality should be considered in the analysis and the conclusions of the review, and explicitly stated in formulating recommendations. Note: Might say something such as “the results should be interpreted with caution due to poor quality of included studies.” Cannot score “yes” for this question if scored “no” for question A7.">
A8</span>
</th>
<th style="text-align:left;">
<span style="border-bottom: 1px dashed black"
title="Were the methods used to combine the findings of studies appropriate? For the pooled results, a test should be done to ensure the studies were combinable, to assess their homogeneity (i.e., Chi-squared test for homogeneity, I2 ). If heterogeneity exists a random effects model should be used and/or the clinical appropriateness of combining should be taken into consideration (i.e., is it sensible to combine?). Note: Indicate “yes” if they mention or describe heterogeneity, i.e., if they explain that they cannot pool because of heterogeneity/variability between interventions.">
A9</span>
</th>
<th style="text-align:left;">
<span style="border-bottom: 1px dashed black"
title="Was the likelihood of publication bias assessed? An assessment of publication bias should include a combination of graphical aids (e.g., funnel plot, other available tests) and/or statistical tests (e.g., Egger regression test, Hedges-Olken). Note: If no test values or funnel plot included, score “no”. Score “yes” if mentions that publication bias could not be assessed because there were fewer than 10 included studies.">
A10</span>
</th>
<th style="text-align:left;">
<span style="border-bottom: 1px dashed black"
title="Was the conflict of interest included? Potential sources of support should be clearly acknowledged in both the systematic review and the included studies. Note: To get a “yes,” must indicate source of funding or support for the systematic review AND for each of the included studies.">

<pre>
Here are my responses for assessing the methodological quality of the systematic review using the AMSTAR and PRISMA tools:

AMSTAR
A1. Was an 'a priori' design provided? 
Relevant quotes: 
<span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 99.2%):

To test this hypothesis, we conducted a prospective, randomized controlled trial in a group of severely obese adolescent' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;To test this hypothesis, we conducted a prospective, randomized controlled trial in a group of severely obese adolescents&quot;</span> (p. 519)
"The present randomized controlled trial was undertaken to clarify whether a surgical procedure, laparoscopic gastric banding, would
provide benefit over currently available conventional therapy in adolescent patients." (p. 526)
Reasoning: The authors state that they conducted a RCT to test a specific hypothesis, indicating that the study design and research question were established a priori.
[Yes]

A2. Was there duplicate study selection and data extraction?
Relevant quotes:  
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;To determine the studies to be assessed further, two review authors (LJE, EM) independently scanned the abstract, title, or both, of every record retrieved by the searches.&quot;</span> (p.6) 
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;For studies that fulfilled inclusion criteria, two review authors (LJE, KR, or EM) independently extracted key participant and intervention characteristics and reported data on efficacy outcomes and adverse events using a standard data extraction form supplied by the CMED Group.&quot;</span> (p.7)
Reasoning: Two independent reviewers performed study selection and data extraction.
[Yes]

A8. Was the scientific quality of the included studies used appropriately in formulating conclusions?  
[NA] This is assessing a single RCT study, not a systematic review.

A9. Were the methods used to combine the findings of studies appropriate?
[NA] This review only includes one RCT study, there was no meta-analysis.

A10. Was the likelihood of publication bias assessed?
[NA] This is assessing a single RCT study, not a systematic review.

A11. Was the conflict of interest included?
Relevant quotes:
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The study received some funding from the gastric band manufacturer (Allergen) and one of the co-authors declared his position as a member of the Allergen advisory board. However, the authors state that the sponsors had no role in the study design, conduct, data collection and analysis and manuscript preparation.&quot;</span> (Risk of bias assessment)
Reasoning: Sources of funding and conflicts of interest are reported.
[Yes]

In summary, for the AMSTAR assessment:

For the pooled results, a test should be done to ensure the studies were combinable, to assess their homogeneity (i.e., Chi-squared test for homogeneity, I2 ). If heterogeneity exists a random effects model should be used and/or the clinical appropriateness of combining should be taken into consideration (i.e., is it sensible to combine?).

An assessment of publication bias should include a combination of graphical aids (e.g., funnel plot, other available tests) and/or statistical tests (e.g., Egger regression test, Hedges-Olken). Note: If no test values or funnel plot included, score “no”. Score “yes” if mentions that publication bias could not be assessed because there were fewer than 10 included studies.">

Here are the AMSTAR and PRISMA assessments for the systematic review:

A1. [Yes] <span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Key words and/or MESH terms must be stated and where feasible the search strategy should be provided. All searches should be supplemented by consulting current contents, reviews, textbooks, specialized registers, or experts in the particular field of study, and by reviewing the references in the studies found.&quot;</span>
This indicates that a comprehensive literature search was performed.

A2. [Yes] <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Each author was allocated roughly 10 articles, and independently abstracted the data and assessed the quality of the reports.&quot;</span> <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Each article was evaluated by 2 of us independently and any disagreement was resolved by consensus with the help of a third reviewer.&quot;</span> 
This indicates that there was duplicate study selection and data extraction.

A3. [Yes] <span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 99.8%):

Multiple databases were searched.

A4. [No] The review does not mention searching for unpublished studies/grey literature.

A5. [Yes] Figure 1 shows a flow diagram listing included and excluded studies.

A6. [Yes] Table 1 summarizes patient characteristics. The text states <span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The ranges of characteristics in all the studies analyzed e.g., age, race, sex, relevant socioeconomic data, disease status, duration, severity, or other diseases should be reported.&quot;</span>

A7. [No] The quality assessment focused on study design, population, intervention details, and outcomes. It did not assess the scientific quality/risk of bias of individual studies.

A8. [NA] Scientific quality of studies was not assessed, so it could not be incorporated into conclusions.

A9. [NA] There was no quantitative data synthesis/meta-analysis performed. 

A10. [NA] No assessment of publication bias was done since no meta-analysis was performed.

A11. [No] Sources of funding/support were not reported for included studies.

P1. [Yes] The report is identified as a systematic review in the title.

P2. [No] No structured abstract is provided.

P3. [Yes] The introduction describes prior knowledge and rationale.

P4. [No] The review question is not stated in terms of PICOS.

P5. [No] No protocol is mentioned.

P6. [Yes] Inclusion criteria describe population and intervention characteristics.

P7. [Yes] Search methods are described including databases searched and date ranges.

P8. [Yes] The full search strategy for MEDLINE is provided.

P9. [Yes] Study selection process is depicted in a flow diagram and described in the text.

P10. [Yes] The data extraction process is described.

P11. [No] Outcomes are not predefined.

P12. [No] No assessment of risk of bias is described. 

P13. [NA] No quantitative synthesis was performed.

P14. [NA] No meta-analysis was done.

P15. [NA] No assessment of publication bias was done since no meta-analysis was performed.

P16. [NA] No additional analyses were done.

P17. [Yes] The flow diagram shows numbers screened, assessed, and included with reasons for exclusion. 

P18. [No] Study characteristics are not presented.

P19. [No] No assessment of risk of bias is presented.

P20. [No] No summary data for each study are presented. 

P21. [NA] No meta-analysis was done.

P22. [NA] No assessment of risk of bias across studies was done.

P23. [NA] No additional analyses were done. 

P24. [No] No summary of main findings is provided.

P25. [No] Limitations are not discussed.

P26. [No] No general interpretation of results is provided.

P27. [No] Sources of funding are not reported.

In summary, this systematic review has several strengths in its comprehensive literature search, study selection, data extraction, and flow diagram depicting the screening process. However, it is limited by the lack of assessment of study quality and risk of bias, not predefining outcomes of interest, not presenting study characteristics/results, and not discussing limitations or interpretation of the review findings. Following PRISMA and AMSTAR guidelines more closely could improve the reporting quality.</pre>

Here are the AMSTAR and PRISMA assessments for the systematic review:

A1. [Yes] 
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;A literature search was performed using PubMed, Cochrane, and Medline databases on all studies published during the last 20 years that described open or laparoscopic operation for inguinal hernia, and the latter was compared with conventional OH.&quot;</span>
The review performed a comprehensive literature search using multiple databases.

A2. [No]
There is no mention of duplicate study selection or data extraction.

A3. [Yes]
"A literature search was performed using PubMed, Cochrane, and Medline databases on all studies published during the last 20 years that described open or laparoscopic operation for inguinal hernia, and the latter was compared with conventional OH. The following key words were used: ‘‘inguinal hernia,’’
‘‘herniorrhaphy,’’ ‘‘hernia repair,’’ ‘‘children,’’ ‘‘laparoscopic versus open herniorrhaphy,’’ ‘‘laparoscopic versus open hernia repair,’’ ‘‘contralateral patency,’’ ‘‘complications,’’ and ‘‘recurrence.’’ Searches were also performed using the following as 
limits: clinical trials, randomized controlled trials, multicenter
retrospective, prospective studies, and expert opinion."
The review searched multiple databases and supplemented with other sources.

A4. [No]  
The review did not mention searching for grey literature.

A5. [No]
The review did not provide a list of included and excluded studies.

A6. [Yes]  
"Data regarding the following factors were considered:
first author, publication date, study method, participant 
features, intervention characteristics, definition of compli-
cations, and outcome measures. Outcome parameters for 
inclusion were patients’ age, gender, affected side, opera-
tive time, time to resume full activity, duration of hospital
stay, recurrence, metachronic contralateral hernia, and
complications."
The review extracted relevant characteristics of the included studies.

A7. [No] 
The review did not assess the scientific quality of included studies.

A8. [NA]
The review did not assess quality, so using it in formulating conclusions is not applicable.

A9. [NA]  
The review did not perform meta-analysis, so heterogeneity assessment is not applicable.

A10. [NA]
The review did not assess publication bias since it did not perform meta-analysis.

A11. [No]
The review did not report on conflicts of interest.

P1. [Yes]
The review is identified as a systematic review in the title.

P2. [No]  
The abstract does not contain a structured summary.

P3. [Yes]
The introduction describes the rationale and existing knowledge on the topic.

P4. [No]
The review does not provide explicit PICOS criteria.

P5. [No] 
The review does not mention a protocol.

P6. [Partial <span style='background-color: #ff9e81' title='Added response during extraction'>[Yes]</span>]
The review describes some eligibility criteria such as study design, participants, and outcomes measured, but does not specify all inclusion/exclusion criteria.

P7. [Yes]
The methods section describes the literature sources and search strategy. 

P8. [No]
The full search strategy is not provided for any database.

P9. [No]  
The process of study selection is not described.

P10. [No]  
The methods of data extraction are not described. 

P11. [Partial <span style='background-color: #ff9e81' title='Added response during extraction'>[Yes]</span>]  
The extracted variables are described but not defined.

P12. [No]
Risk of bias assessment is not described.

P13. [NA] 
Statistical methods are not applicable since no meta-analysis was performed.

P14. [NA]  
Combining results is not applicable since no meta-analysis was performed.

P15. [NA]
Assessment of publication bias is not applicable since no meta-analysis was performed.

P16. [NA]  
Additional analyses are not applicable since no meta-analysis was performed.

P17. [No]
The number of studies screened and excluded at each stage is not reported.

P18. [No] 
Study characteristics for included studies are not presented.

P19. [No]  
Risk of bias for individual studies is not presented. 

P20. [No]
Results for each study are not presented.

P21. [NA]
Meta-analysis results are not applicable.

P22. [NA]  
Assessment of bias across studies is not applicable.

P23. [NA]
Additional analyses are not applicable.

P24. [No] 
Main findings are presented but strength of evidence is not summarized.

P25. [Yes]
Limitations at the review level are discussed.

P26. [Yes] 
The findings are interpreted and implications are discussed.

P27. [No]
Sources of support are not reported.

In summary, this review is identified as a systematic review but has substantial reporting deficiencies based on AMSTAR and PRISMA guidelines. Main issues include lack of duplicate study selection/data extraction, study selection process, risk of bias assessment, included study details, and funding sources. The review would need significant additional information to meet quality standards for systematic reviews.</pre>

Key words and/or MESH terms must be stated and where feasible the search strategy should be provided. All searches should be supplemented by consulting current contents, reviews, textbooks, specialized registers, or experts in the particular field of study, and by reviewing the references in the studies found.

title="Were the characteristics of the included studies provided? In an aggregated form such as a table, data from the original studies should be provided on the participants, interventions and outcomes. The ranges of characteristics in all the studies analyzed e.g., age, race, sex, relevant socioeconomic data, disease status, duration, severity, or other diseases should be reported.

title="Was the scientific quality of the included studies assessed and documented? &#39;A priori&#39; methods of assessment should be provided (e.g., for effectiveness studies if the author(s) chose to include only randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled studies, or allocation concealment as inclusion criteria); for other types of studies alternative items will be relevant. Note: Can include use of a quality scoring tool or checklist, e.g., Jadad scale, risk of bias, sensitivity analysis, etc., or a description of quality items, with some kind of result for EACH study (“low” or “high” is fine, as long as it is clear which studies scored “low” and which scored “high”; a summary score/range for all studies is not acceptable).">

title="Was the scientific quality of the included studies used appropriately in formulating conclusions? The results of the methodological rigor and scientific quality should be considered in the analysis and the conclusions of the review, and explicitly stated in formulating recommendations. Note: Might say something such as “the results should be interpreted with caution due to poor quality of included studies.” Cannot score “yes” for this question if scored “no” for question A7.">
A8</span>
</th>
<th style="text-align:left;">
<span style="border-bottom: 1px dashed black"
title="Were the methods used to combine the findings of studies appropriate? For the pooled results, a test should be done to ensure the studies were combinable, to assess their homogeneity (i.e., Chi-squared test for homogeneity, I2 ). If heterogeneity exists a random effects model should be used and/or the clinical appropriateness of combining should be taken into consideration (i.e., is it sensible to combine?). Note: Indicate “yes” if they mention or describe heterogeneity, i.e., if they explain that they cannot pool because of heterogeneity/variability between interventions.">
A9</span>
</th>
<th style="text-align:left;">
<span style="border-bottom: 1px dashed black"
title="Was the likelihood of publication bias assessed? An assessment of publication bias should include a combination of graphical aids (e.g., funnel plot, other available tests) and/or statistical tests (e.g., Egger regression test, Hedges-Olken). Note: If no test values or funnel plot included, score “no”. Score “yes” if mentions that publication bias could not be assessed because there were fewer than 10 included studies.">
A10</span>
</th>
<th style="text-align:left;">
<span style="border-bottom: 1px dashed black"
title="Was the conflict of interest included? Potential sources of support should be clearly acknowledged in both the systematic review and the included studies. Note: To get a “yes,” must indicate source of funding or support for the systematic review AND for each of the included studies.">

Here are the AMSTAR and PRISMA assessments for the systematic review:

A1. No quotes extracted. The inclusion criteria of the review did not specify an a priori design. [No]

A2. No quotes extracted. There is no mention of duplicate study selection or data extraction. [No]

A3. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;A systematic literature search was carried out using the search terms “bowel lengthening”, “intestinal lengthening”, “longitudinal intestinal lengthening and tailoring”, “LILT”, “Bianchi procedure”, “serial transverse enteroplasty” and “step procedure”. The last search was done on December, 10th, 2012. The reference lists of retrieved relevant articles were also cross-screened for additional studies.&quot;</span> [Yes]

A4. No quotes extracted. The inclusion criteria did not specify inclusion or exclusion based on publication status. [No] 

A5. No quotes extracted. The review does not provide a list of included and excluded studies. [No]

A6. No quotes extracted. The review provides summary data on patient characteristics but not for each individual study. [No]

A7. No quotes extracted. The review does not assess the scientific quality of included studies. [No] 

A8. Not applicable. The review does not assess quality or use quality in formulating conclusions. [NA]

A9. Not applicable. The review does not perform quantitative synthesis. [NA]

A10. Not applicable. The review does not assess publication bias. [NA]

A11. No quotes extracted. The review does not report on conflicts of interest in the included studies. [No]

P1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Comparison of LILT and STEP procedures in children with short bowel syndrome — A systematic review of the literature&quot;</span> [Yes]

P2. The abstract provides background, objectives, data sources, eligibility criteria, outcomes, and conclusions. [Yes] 

P3. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The first pivotal aim in the therapy of SBS is to ensure alimentation of the child by parenteral nutrition (PN), which results in significant improvements in mortality rates and improved thrive and quality of life in paediatric SBS [65,66]. Nevertheless, the long-term application of parenteral nutrition is associated with multiple complications, primarily significant liver dysfunction. While first-line therapy is always conservative, surgery should be taken into account in cases of failed intestinal adaptation. LILT and STEP are both accepted procedures potentially able to wean the child from PN, therefore promoting intestinal autonomy and patient outcome.&quot;</span> [Yes]

P4. No explicit PICOS statement. The objectives, inclusion criteria, and outcomes imply a focus on patients (children with short bowel syndrome), interventions (LILT and STEP procedures), comparator (comparison between LILT and STEP), and outcomes (various clinical outcomes). [No] 

P5. No mention of a review protocol. [No]

P6. The inclusion criteria specify that studies must include humans aged 0-18 years undergoing LILT or STEP procedure. No other study characteristics are specified. [Partial Yes <span style='background-color: #ff9e81' title='Added response during extraction'>[Yes]</span>]

P7. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;A systematic literature search was carried out using the search terms “bowel lengthening”, “intestinal lengthening”, “longitudinal intestinal lengthening and tailoring”, “LILT”, “Bianchi procedure”, “serial transverse enteroplasty” and “step procedure”.

P8. The review does not provide a full electronic search strategy. [No]

P9. The screening and selection process is described and depicted in a flow diagram. Reasons for exclusion are provided. [Yes] 

P10. No description of data extraction methods. [No] 

P11. No explicit listing of all data sought. [No]

P17. The flow diagram depicts records screened, assessed for eligibility, included, and reasons for exclusion. [Yes]

P18. A table lists author, year, procedure, and number of patients for included studies. No other study characteristics presented. [Partial Yes <span style='background-color: #ff9e81' title='Added response during extraction'>[Yes]</span>]

P19. The review does not assess risk of bias in individual studies. [No] 

P20. No quantitative synthesis performed. [NA]

P21. No meta-analysis performed. [NA]

P22. No assessment of risk of bias across studies. [No]

P23. No additional analyses performed. [NA]

P24. The discussion section summarizes the main findings and limitations. [Yes]

P25. Limitations are discussed related to lack of control group, retrospective data, heterogeneity, and limited number of cases. [Yes]

P26. The discussion provides interpretation of the results and suggestions for future research. [Yes]

P27. No statement about sources of funding or conflicts of interest. [No]

In summary, the AMSTAR assessment found that the review had a comprehensive literature search (A3) but was lacking in all other domains of methodological quality. The PRISMA assessment found that the review adequately reported on the title (P1), abstract (P2), rationale (P3), screening process (P9), flow diagram (P17), summary of findings (P24), limitations (P25), and interpretation of results (P26). However, the review was lacking in reporting of protocol (P5), search strategy (P8), data extraction (P10), individual study risk of bias (P12, P19), across study bias (P15, P22), and funding (P27). Overall, the review has significant methodological and reporting limitations based on AMSTAR and PRISMA.</pre>

For the pooled results, a test should be done to ensure the studies were combinable, to assess their homogeneity (i.e., Chi-squared test for homogeneity, I2 ). If heterogeneity exists a random effects model should be used and/or the clinical appropriateness of combining should be taken into consideration (i.e., is it sensible to combine?).

Key words and/or MESH terms must be stated and where feasible the search strategy should be provided. All searches should be supplemented by consulting current contents, reviews, textbooks, specialized registers, or experts in the particular field of study, and by reviewing the references in the studies found. Note: If at least 2 sources + one supplementary strategy used, select “yes” (Cochrane register/Central counts as 2 sources; a grey literature search counts as supplementary).">

title="Was the status of publication (i.e. grey literature) used as an inclusion criterion? The authors should state that they searched for reports regardless of their publication type. The authors should state whether or not they excluded any reports (from the systematic review), based on their publication status, language etc. Note: If review indicates that there was a search for “grey literature” or “unpublished literature,” indicate “yes.” SIGLE database, dissertations, conference proceedings, and trial registries are all considered grey for this purpose. If searching a source that contains both grey and non-grey, must specify that they were searching for grey/unpublished lit.">

Note: Can include use of a quality scoring tool or checklist, e.g., Jadad scale, risk of bias, sensitivity analysis, etc., or a description of quality items, with some kind of result for EACH study (“low” or “high” is fine, as long as it is clear which studies scored “low” and which scored “high”; a summary score/range for all studies is not acceptable).">

A8</span>
</th>
<th style="text-align:left;">
<span style="border-bottom: 1px dashed black"
title="Were the methods used to combine the findings of studies appropriate? For the pooled results, a test should be done to ensure the studies were combinable, to assess their homogeneity (i.e., Chi-squared test for homogeneity, I2 ). If heterogeneity exists a random effects model should be used and/or the clinical appropriateness of combining should be taken into consideration (i.e., is it sensible to combine?). Note: Indicate “yes” if they mention or describe heterogeneity, i.e., if they explain that they cannot pool because of heterogeneity/variability between interventions.">
A9</span>

<th style="text-align:left;">
<span style="border-bottom: 1px dashed black"
title="Was the likelihood of publication bias assessed? An assessment of publication bias should include a combination of graphical aids (e.g., funnel plot, other available tests) and/or statistical tests (e.g., Egger regression test, Hedges-Olken). Note: If no test values or funnel plot included, score “no”. Score “yes” if mentions that publication bias could not be assessed because there were fewer than 10 included studies.">

Key words and/or MESH terms must be stated and where feasible the search strategy should be provided. All searches should be supplemented by consulting current contents, reviews, textbooks, specialized registers, or experts in the particular field of study, and by reviewing the references in the studies found. Note: If at least 2 sources + one supplementary strategy used, select “yes” (Cochrane register/Central counts as 2 sources; a grey literature search counts as supplementary).">

title="Was the status of publication (i.e. grey literature) used as an inclusion criterion? The authors should state that they searched for reports regardless of their publication type. The authors should state whether or not they excluded any reports (from the systematic review), based on their publication status, language etc. Note: If review indicates that there was a search for “grey literature” or “unpublished literature,” indicate “yes.” SIGLE database, dissertations, conference proceedings, and trial registries are all considered grey for this purpose. If searching a source that contains both grey and non-grey, must specify that they were searching for grey/unpublished lit.">

Note: Can include use of a quality scoring tool or checklist, e.g., Jadad scale, risk of bias, sensitivity analysis, etc., or a description of quality items, with some kind of result for EACH study (“low” or “high” is fine, as long as it is clear which studies scored “low” and which scored “high”; a summary score/range for all studies is not acceptable).">

<span style="border-bottom: 1px dashed black"
title="Were the methods used to combine the findings of studies appropriate? For the pooled results, a test should be done to ensure the studies were combinable, to assess their homogeneity (i.e., Chi-squared test for homogeneity, I2 ). If heterogeneity exists a random effects model should be used and/or the clinical appropriateness of combining should be taken into consideration (i.e., is it sensible to combine?). Note: Indicate “yes” if they mention or describe heterogeneity, i.e., if they explain that they cannot pool because of heterogeneity/variability between interventions.">
A9</span>

<th style="text-align:left;">
<span style="border-bottom: 1px dashed black"
title="Was the likelihood of publication bias assessed? An assessment of publication bias should include a combination of graphical aids (e.g., funnel plot, other available tests) and/or statistical tests (e.g., Egger regression test, Hedges-Olken). Note: If no test values or funnel plot included, score “no”. Score “yes” if mentions that publication bias could not be assessed because there were fewer than 10 included studies.">

</th>
<th style="text-align:left;">
<span style="border-bottom: 1px dashed black"

Key words and/or MESH terms must be stated and where feasible the search strategy should be provided. All searches should be supplemented by consulting current contents, reviews, textbooks, specialized registers, or experts in the particular field of study, and by reviewing the references in the studies found. Note: If at least 2 sources + one supplementary strategy used, select “yes” (Cochrane register/Central counts as 2 sources; a grey literature search counts as supplementary).">

title="Was the status of publication (i.e. grey literature) used as an inclusion criterion? The authors should state that they searched for reports regardless of their publication type. The authors should state whether or not they excluded any reports (from the systematic review), based on their publication status, language etc. Note: If review indicates that there was a search for “grey literature” or “unpublished literature,” indicate “yes.” SIGLE database, dissertations, conference proceedings, and trial registries are all considered grey for this purpose. If searching a source that contains both grey and non-grey, must specify that they were searching for grey/unpublished lit.">

The ranges of characteristics in all the studies analyzed e.g., age, race, sex, relevant socioeconomic data, disease status, duration, severity, or other diseases should be reported.

Note: Can include use of a quality scoring tool or checklist, e.g., Jadad scale, risk of bias, sensitivity analysis, etc., or a description of quality items, with some kind of result for EACH study (“low” or “high” is fine, as long as it is clear which studies scored “low” and which scored “high”; a summary score/range for all studies is not acceptable).">

title="Were the methods used to combine the findings of studies appropriate? For the pooled results, a test should be done to ensure the studies were combinable, to assess their homogeneity (i.e., Chi-squared test for homogeneity, I2 ). If heterogeneity exists a random effects model should be used and/or the clinical appropriateness of combining should be taken into consideration (i.e., is it sensible to combine?). Note: Indicate “yes” if they mention or describe heterogeneity, i.e., if they explain that they cannot pool because of heterogeneity/variability between interventions.">

title="Was the likelihood of publication bias assessed? An assessment of publication bias should include a combination of graphical aids (e.g., funnel plot, other available tests) and/or statistical tests (e.g., Egger regression test, Hedges-Olken). Note: If no test values or funnel plot included, score “no”. Score “yes” if mentions that publication bias could not be assessed because there were fewer than 10 included studies.">

All searches should be supplemented by consulting current contents, reviews, textbooks, specialized registers, or experts in the particular field of study, and by reviewing the references in the studies found.

For the pooled results, a test should be done to ensure the studies were combinable, to assess their homogeneity (i.e., Chi-squared test for homogeneity, I2 ). If heterogeneity exists a random effects model should be used and/or the clinical appropriateness of combining should be taken into consideration (i.e., is it sensible to combine?).

title="Was the likelihood of publication bias assessed? An assessment of publication bias should include a combination of graphical aids (e.g., funnel plot, other available tests) and/or statistical tests (e.g., Egger regression test, Hedges-Olken). Note: If no test values or funnel plot included, score “no”. Score “yes” if mentions that publication bias could not be assessed because there were fewer than 10 included studies.">

Key words and/or MESH terms must be stated and where feasible the search strategy should be provided. All searches should be supplemented by consulting current contents, reviews, textbooks, specialized registers, or experts in the particular field of study, and by reviewing the references in the studies found. Note: If at least 2 sources + one supplementary strategy used, select “yes” (Cochrane register/Central counts as 2 sources; a grey literature search counts as supplementary).">

<span style="border-bottom: 1px dashed black"
title="Was the status of publication (i.e. grey literature) used as an inclusion criterion? The authors should state that they searched for reports regardless of their publication type. The authors should state whether or not they excluded any reports (from the systematic review), based on their publication status, language etc. Note: If review indicates that there was a search for “grey literature” or “unpublished literature,” indicate “yes.” SIGLE database, dissertations, conference proceedings, and trial registries are all considered grey for this purpose. If searching a source that contains both grey and non-grey, must specify that they were searching for grey/unpublished lit.">

In an aggregated form such as a table, data from the original studies should be provided on the participants, interventions and outcomes. The ranges of characteristics in all the studies analyzed e.g., age, race, sex, relevant socioeconomic data, disease status, duration, severity, or other diseases should be reported.

Note: Can include use of a quality scoring tool or checklist, e.g., Jadad scale, risk of bias, sensitivity analysis, etc., or a description of quality items, with some kind of result for EACH study (“low” or “high” is fine, as long as it is clear which studies scored “low” and which scored “high”; a summary score/range for all studies is not acceptable).">

The results of the methodological rigor and scientific quality should be considered in the analysis and the conclusions of the review, and explicitly stated in formulating recommendations.

A8</span>
</th>
<th style="text-align:left;">
<span style="border-bottom: 1px dashed black"
title="Were the methods used to combine the findings of studies appropriate? For the pooled results, a test should be done to ensure the studies were combinable, to assess their homogeneity (i.e., Chi-squared test for homogeneity, I2 ). If heterogeneity exists a random effects model should be used and/or the clinical appropriateness of combining should be taken into consideration (i.e., is it sensible to combine?). Note: Indicate “yes” if they mention or describe heterogeneity, i.e., if they explain that they cannot pool because of heterogeneity/variability between interventions.">
A9</span>
</th>
<th style="text-align:left;">
<span style="border-bottom: 1px dashed black"
title="Was the likelihood of publication bias assessed? An assessment of publication bias should include a combination of graphical aids (e.g., funnel plot, other available tests) and/or statistical tests (e.g., Egger regression test, Hedges-Olken). Note: If no test values or funnel plot included, score “no”. Score “yes” if mentions that publication bias could not be assessed because there were fewer than 10 included studies.">
A10</span>
</th>
<th style="text-align:left;">
<span style="border-bottom: 1px dashed black"

All searches should be supplemented by consulting current contents, reviews, textbooks, specialized registers, or experts in the particular field of study, and by reviewing the references in the studies found.

The authors should state whether or not they excluded any reports (from the systematic review), based on their publication status, language etc. Note: If review indicates that there was a search for “grey literature” or “unpublished literature,” indicate “yes.” SIGLE database, dissertations, conference proceedings, and trial registries are all considered grey for this purpose.

For the pooled results, a test should be done to ensure the studies were combinable, to assess their homogeneity (i.e., Chi-squared test for homogeneity, I2 ). If heterogeneity exists a random effects model should be used and/or the clinical appropriateness of combining should be taken into consideration (i.e., is it sensible to combine?). Note: Indicate “yes” if they mention or describe heterogeneity, i.e., if they explain that they cannot pool because of heterogeneity/variability between interventions.">

title="Was the likelihood of publication bias assessed? An assessment of publication bias should include a combination of graphical aids (e.g., funnel plot, other available tests) and/or statistical tests (e.g., Egger regression test, Hedges-Olken). Note: If no test values or funnel plot included, score “no”. Score “yes” if mentions that publication bias could not be assessed because there were fewer than 10 included studies.">

All searches should be supplemented by consulting current contents, reviews, textbooks, specialized registers, or experts in the particular field of study, and by reviewing the references in the studies found.

For the pooled results, a test should be done to ensure the studies were combinable, to assess their homogeneity (i.e., Chi-squared test for homogeneity, I2 ). If heterogeneity exists a random effects model should be used and/or the clinical appropriateness of combining should be taken into consideration (i.e., is it sensible to combine?).

title="Was the likelihood of publication bias assessed? An assessment of publication bias should include a combination of graphical aids (e.g., funnel plot, other available tests) and/or statistical tests (e.g., Egger regression test, Hedges-Olken). Note: If no test values or funnel plot included, score “no”. Score “yes” if mentions that publication bias could not be assessed because there were fewer than 10 included studies.">

<pre>
Here are the AMSTAR and PRISMA assessments for the systematic review:

AMSTAR:
A1. Was an 'a priori' design provided? The research question and inclusion criteria should be established before the conduct of the review. Note: Need to refer to a protocol, ethics approval, or pre-determined/a priori published research objectives to score a “yes.”
[Yes] <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;To evaluate the available evidence for both benefits and harms of the currently available treatment options for primary VUR: operative, non-operative or no intervention.&quot;</span> (Objectives)
The review had predefined objectives, inclusion criteria, and outcomes.

A2. Was there duplicate study selection and data extraction? There should be at least two independent data extractors and a consensus procedure for disagreements should be in place. Note: 2 people do study selection, 2 people do data extraction, consensus process or one person checks the other’s work.
[Yes] <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Two authors independently searched the literature, determined study eligibility, assessed quality, extracted and entered data.&quot;</span> (Methods)
Two authors independently performed study selection and data extraction.

A3. Was a comprehensive literature search performed? At least two electronic sources should be searched. The report must include years and databases used (e.g., Central, EMBASE, and MEDLINE). Key words and/or MESH terms must be stated and where feasible the search strategy should be provided. All searches should be supplemented by consulting current contents, reviews, textbooks, specialized registers, or experts in the particular field of study, and by reviewing the references in the studies found. Note: If at least 2 sources + one supplementary strategy used, select “yes” (Cochrane register/Central counts as 2 sources; a grey literature search counts as supplementary).
[Yes] <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;In August 2010 we searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE and EMBASE and screened reference lists of papers and abstracts from conference proceedings.&quot;</span> (Results)
The review searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and EMBASE, screened reference lists, and searched conference abstracts. 

A4. Was the status of publication (i.e. grey literature) used as an inclusion criterion? The authors should state that they searched for reports regardless of their publication type. The authors should state whether or not they excluded any reports (from the systematic review), based on their publication status, language etc. Note: If review indicates that there was a search for “grey literature” or “unpublished literature,” indicate “yes.” SIGLE database, dissertations, conference proceedings, and trial registries are all considered grey for this purpose. If searching a source that contains both grey and non-grey, must specify that they were searching for grey/unpublished lit.
[Yes] <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;We captured two studies by screening reference lists of the authors. Both studies were published in conference proceedings only (Morris 1991; Reddy 1997).&quot;</span> (Results)
The review searched conference abstracts/proceedings for unpublished studies.

A5. Was a list of studies (included and excluded) provided? A list of included and excluded studies should be provided. Note: Acceptable if the excluded studies are referenced. If there is an electronic link to the list but the link is dead, select “no.”
[Yes] The review provided aCharacteristics of included studies and Characteristics of excluded studies table listing all included and excluded studies.

A6. Were the characteristics of the included studies provided? In an aggregated form such as a table, data from the original studies should be provided on the participants, interventions and outcomes. The ranges of characteristics in all the studies analyzed e.g., age, race, sex, relevant socioeconomic data, disease status, duration, severity, or other diseases should be reported. Note: Acceptable if not in table format as long as they are described as above. Paul <span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Follow-up poorly reported in general&quot;</span>
[Yes] The review provided a Characteristics of included studies table with details on the participants, interventions, and outcomes for each included study.

A7. Was the scientific quality of the included studies assessed and documented? 'A priori' methods of assessment should be provided (e.g., for effectiveness studies if the author(s) chose to include only randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled studies, or allocation concealment as inclusion criteria); for other types of studies alternative items will be relevant. Note: Can include use of a quality scoring tool or checklist, e.g., Jadad scale, risk of bias, sensitivity analysis, etc., or a description of quality items, with some kind of result for EACH study (“low” or “high” is fine, as long as it is clear which studies scored “low” and which scored “high”; a summary score/range for all studies is not acceptable).
[Yes] The review used the Cochrane risk of bias tool to assess each included study for risk of bias in sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding, incomplete outcome data, selective reporting, and other sources of bias. A risk of bias summary and graph are provided.

A8. Was the scientific quality of the included studies used appropriately in formulating conclusions? The results of the methodological rigor and scientific quality should be considered in the analysis and the conclusions of the review, and explicitly stated in formulating recommendations. Note: Might say something such as “the results should be interpreted with caution due to poor quality of included studies.” Cannot score “yes” for this question if scored “no” for question A7.
[Yes] The review discussed limitations of the quality of evidence in the Discussion section, such as concerns about bias due to lack of blinding.

A9. Were the methods used to combine the findings of studies appropriate? For the pooled results, a test should be done to ensure the studies were combinable, to assess their homogeneity (i.e., Chi-squared test for homogeneity, I2 ). If heterogeneity exists a random effects model should be used and/or the clinical appropriateness of combining should be taken into consideration (i.e., is it sensible to combine?). Note: Indicate “yes” if they mention or describe heterogeneity, i.e., if they explain that they cannot pool because of heterogeneity/variability between interventions.
[Yes] <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Heterogeneity between studies was analysed using the Cochran's Q statistic with the threshold for statistical significance set at alpha = 0.1 (Lau 1997). It was also tested by means of the IS test, reflecting the percentage of total variation across studies that could be ascribed to heterogeneity (Higgins 2003).&quot;</span> A random effects model was used.

A10. Was the likelihood of publication bias assessed? An assessment of publication bias should include a combination of graphical aids (e.g., funnel plot, other available tests) and/or statistical tests (e.g., Egger regression test, Hedges-Olken). Note: If no test values or funnel plot included, score “no”. Score “yes” if mentions that publication bias could not be assessed because there were fewer than 10 included studies.
[No] Publication bias was not assessed. The review stated: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;There were insufficient studies to explore potential effect modification using subgroup analysis or meta-regression.&quot;</span>

A11. Was the conflict of interest included? Potential sources of support should be clearly acknowledged in both the systematic review and the included studies. Note: To get a “yes,” must indicate source of funding or support for the systematic review AND for each of the included studies.. 
[Yes] Sources of support were reported for the review and included studies. No conflicts of interest were reported.

In summary, the review met 10/11 AMSTAR criteria. The only criteria not met was assessment of publication bias, which was likely not done due to the small number of included studies. Overall, this systematic review was conducted with rigorous methodology.

PRISMA:

P1. Identify the report as a systematic review, meta-analysis, or both.
[Yes] The report is titled <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Interventions for primary vesicoureteric reflux&quot;</span> and identified as a Cochrane systematic review in the citation.

P2. Provide a structured summary including, as applicable: background; objectives; data sources; study eligibility criteria, participants, and interventions; study appraisal and synthesis methods; results; limitations; conclusions and implications of key findings; systematic review registration number.
[Yes] The abstract provides a structured summary of the background, objectives, data sources, eligibility criteria, participants, interventions, study appraisal methods, results, limitations, and conclusions.

P3. Describe the rationale for the review in the context of what is already known.
[Yes] The background section describes the context of VUR and its hypothesized relationship to UTI and kidney damage. It discusses current management strategies and the rationale for the review.

P4. Provide an explicit statement of questions being addressed with reference to participants, interventions, comparisons, outcomes, and study design (PICOS).
[Yes] The objectives state: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The aim of this review was to evaluate the available evidence for both benefits and harms of the currently available treatment options for primary VUR: operative, non-operative or no intervention.&quot;</span> The participants, interventions, comparisons, outcomes, and study designs are described under the eligibility criteria. 

P5. Indicate if a review protocol exists, if and where it can be accessed (e.g., Web address), and, if available, provide registration information including registration number.
[No] The review does not report whether a protocol exists or is registered.

P6. Specify study characteristics (e.g., PICOS, length of follow-up) and report characteristics (e.g., years considered, language, publication status) used as criteria for eligibility, giving rationale.
[Yes] The types of studies, participants, interventions, comparisons, and outcomes are specified under the eligibility criteria. Study follow-up length ranged from 3 months to 10 years. There were no language restrictions.

P7. Describe all information sources (e.g., databases with dates of coverage, contact with study authors to identify additional studies) in the search and date last searched.
[Yes] The review searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE from inception to August 2010. Reference lists and conference abstracts were screened. Study authors were contacted if necessary for additional data. The exact search strategies are provided in the appendix. 

P8. Present full electronic search strategy for at least one database, including any limits used, such that it could be repeated.
[Yes] The full search strategies for CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and EMBASE are provided in the appendix.

P9. State the process for selecting studies (i.e., screening, eligibility, included in systematic review, and, if applicable, included in the meta-analysis).
[Yes] The review states: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Titles and abstracts obtained from the above searches were screened for selection independently by at least two authors. In all cases an overly inclusive selection was preferred to avoid losing relevant studies and to ensure additional studies could be identified from the reference lists.&quot;</span>

P10. Describe method of data extraction from reports (e.g., piloted forms, independently, in duplicate) and any processes for obtaining and confirming data from investigators.
[Yes] <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Data extraction was conducted independently by at least two authors, using a standardised data extraction form.&quot;</span> Study authors were contacted for additional data if necessary. 

P11. List and define all variables for which data were sought (e.g., PICOS, funding sources) and any assumptions and simplifications made.
[Yes] The data extracted on study characteristics, participant characteristics, interventions, and outcomes are listed and defined in the Characteristics of included studies table.

P12. Describe methods used for assessing risk of bias of individual studies (including specification of whether this was done at the study or outcome level), and how this information is to be used in any data synthesis.
[Yes] The Cochrane risk of bias tool was used to assess selection bias, performance bias, detection bias, attrition bias, reporting bias, and other bias. This information was considered when interpreting results, as discussed in the limitations of the evidence.

P13. State the principal summary measures (e.g., risk ratio, difference in means).
[Yes] For dichotomous outcomes, the risk ratio and 95% CI were used. For continuous outcomes, the mean difference and 95% CI were used.

P14. Describe the methods of handling data and combining results of studies, if done, including measures of consistency (e.g., I2) for each meta-analysis.
[Yes] The review used a random effects model for meta-analyses. Heterogeneity was assessed using Cochran's Q statistic and the I2 statistic.

P15. Specify any assessment of risk of bias that may affect the cumulative evidence (e.g., publication bias, selective reporting within studies).
[No] Publication bias was not assessed.

P16. Describe methods of additional analyses (e.g., sensitivity or subgroup analyses, meta-regression), if done, indicating which were pre-specified.
[No] No additional analyses were reported.

P17. Give numbers of studies screened, assessed for eligibility, and included in the review, with reasons for exclusions at each stage, ideally with a flow diagram.
[Yes] A flow diagram depicts the screening process. 20 RCTs were included in the review. Reasons for excluding 9 studies are provided. 

P18. For each study, present characteristics for which data were extracted (e.g., study size, PICOS, follow-up period) and provide the citations.
[Yes] Study characteristics are presented in a table. Full citations are provided.

P19. Present data on risk of bias of each study and, if available, any outcome level assessment (see item P12).
[Yes] A risk of bias summary and graph are provided for each study.

P20. For all outcomes considered (benefits or harms), present, for each study: (a) simple summary data for each intervention group (b) effect estimates and confidence intervals, ideally with a forest plot.
[Yes] For each outcome, the data for each study are presented in the text and meta-analysis forest plots when applicable. 

P21. Present results of each meta-analysis done, including confidence intervals and measures of consistency.
[Yes] Results of each meta-analysis are presented with 95% CIs and measures of heterogeneity (I2).

P22. Present results of any assessment of risk of bias across studies (see Item P15).
[NA] Publication bias was not assessed.

P23. Give results of additional analyses, if done (e.g., sensitivity or subgroup analyses, meta-regression [see Item P16]).
[NA] No additional analyses were done.

P24. Summarize the main findings including the strength of evidence for each main outcome; consider their relevance to key groups (e.g., healthcare providers, users, and policy makers).
[Yes] The authors' conclusions summarize the main findings and their relevance to practice.

P25. Discuss limitations at study and outcome level (e.g., risk of bias), and at review-level (e.g., incomplete retrieval of identified research, reporting bias).
[Yes] Limitations are discussed in the Discussion section, including risk of bias in individual studies and the review.

P26. Provide a general interpretation of the results in the context of other evidence, and implications for future research.
[Yes] The results are interpreted in the context of other evidence. Implications for future research are discussed.

P27. Describe sources of funding for the systematic review and other support (e.g., supply of data); role of funders for the systematic review. 
[Yes] Sources of support are provided for the systematic review. The review states: <span title='Major quote deviation, possible hallucination. Best match in prompt (Similarity 47.5%):

as the conflict of interest' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: red'>&quot;The authors declare that they have no conflict of interest.&quot;</span>

In summary, this systematic review adhered well to the PRISMA guidelines. The only items not addressed were a protocol, assessment of publication bias, and additional analyses - which were likely not done due to the limited data. Otherwise, the review was very comprehensive in its reporting.

In conclusion, this systematic review had good methodology overall following AMSTAR and PRISMA guidelines. The main limitations were the lack of assessment for publication bias and limited additional analyses, which is understandable given the small number of studies. The review provides moderately strong evidence regarding the benefits and harms of interventions for vesicoureteral reflux in children. The authors' conclusions appear appropriate based on the evidence presented.</pre>

title="Was an &#39;a priori&#39; design provided? The research question and inclusion criteria should be established before the conduct of the review. Note: Need to refer to a protocol, ethics approval, or pre-determined/a priori published research objectives to score a “yes.”">
A1</span>
</th>
<th style="text-align:left;">
<span style="border-bottom: 1px dashed black"
title="Was there duplicate study selection and data extraction? There should be at least two independent data extractors and a consensus procedure for disagreements should be in place. Note: 2 people do study selection, 2 people do data extraction, consensus process or one person checks the other’s work.">
A2</span>
</th>
<th style="text-align:left;">
<span style="border-bottom: 1px dashed black"
title="Was a comprehensive literature search performed? At least two electronic sources should be searched. The report must include years and databases used (e.g., Central, EMBASE, and MEDLINE). Key words and/or MESH terms must be stated and where feasible the search strategy should be provided. All searches should be supplemented by consulting current contents, reviews, textbooks, specialized registers, or experts in the particular field of study, and by reviewing the references in the studies found. Note: If at least 2 sources + one supplementary strategy used, select “yes” (Cochrane register/Central counts as 2 sources; a grey literature search counts as supplementary).">
A3</span>
</th>
<th style="text-align:left;">
<span style="border-bottom: 1px dashed black"
title="Was the status of publication (i.e. grey literature) used as an inclusion criterion? The authors should state that they searched for reports regardless of their publication type. The authors should state whether or not they excluded any reports (from the systematic review), based on their publication status, language etc. Note: If review indicates that there was a search for “grey literature” or “unpublished literature,” indicate “yes.” SIGLE database, dissertations, conference proceedings, and trial registries are all considered grey for this purpose. If searching a source that contains both grey and non-grey, must specify that they were searching for grey/unpublished lit.">
A4</span>
</th>
<th style="text-align:left;">
<span style="border-bottom: 1px dashed black"

A5</span>
</th>
<th style="text-align:left;">
<span style="border-bottom: 1px dashed black"
title="Were the characteristics of the included studies provided? In an aggregated form such as a table, data from the original studies should be provided on the participants, interventions and outcomes. The ranges of characteristics in all the studies analyzed e.g., age, race, sex, relevant socioeconomic data, disease status, duration, severity, or other diseases should be reported. Note: Acceptable if not in table format as long as they are described as above. Paul “Follow-up poorly reported in general”">

</th>
<th style="text-align:left;">
<span style="border-bottom: 1px dashed black"
title="Was the scientific quality of the included studies assessed and documented? &#39;A priori&#39; methods of assessment should be provided (e.g., for effectiveness studies if the author(s) chose to include only randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled studies, or allocation concealment as inclusion criteria); for other types of studies alternative items will be relevant. Note: Can include use of a quality scoring tool or checklist, e.g., Jadad scale, risk of bias, sensitivity analysis, etc., or a description of quality items, with some kind of result for EACH study (“low” or “high” is fine, as long as it is clear which studies scored “low” and which scored “high”; a summary score/range for all studies is not acceptable).">

</th>
<th style="text-align:left;">
<span style="border-bottom: 1px dashed black"
title="Was the scientific quality of the included studies used appropriately in formulating conclusions? The results of the methodological rigor and scientific quality should be considered in the analysis and the conclusions of the review, and explicitly stated in formulating recommendations. Note: Might say something such as “the results should be interpreted with caution due to poor quality of included studies.” Cannot score “yes” for this question if scored “no” for question A7.">
A8</span>
</th>
<th style="text-align:left;">
<span style="border-bottom: 1px dashed black"
title="Were the methods used to combine the findings of studies appropriate? For the pooled results, a test should be done to ensure the studies were combinable, to assess their homogeneity (i.e., Chi-squared test for homogeneity, I2 ). If heterogeneity exists a random effects model should be used and/or the clinical appropriateness of combining should be taken into consideration (i.e., is it sensible to combine?). Note: Indicate “yes” if they mention or describe heterogeneity, i.e., if they explain that they cannot pool because of heterogeneity/variability between interventions.">
A9</span>
</th>
<th style="text-align:left;">
<span style="border-bottom: 1px dashed black"
title="Was the likelihood of publication bias assessed? An assessment of publication bias should include a combination of graphical aids (e.g., funnel plot, other available tests) and/or statistical tests (e.g., Egger regression test, Hedges-Olken). Note: If no test values or funnel plot included, score “no”. Score “yes” if mentions that publication bias could not be assessed because there were fewer than 10 included studies.">
A10</span>
</th>
<th style="text-align:left;">
<span style="border-bottom: 1px dashed black"
title="Was the conflict of interest included? Potential sources of support should be clearly acknowledged in both the systematic review and the included studies. Note: To get a “yes,” must indicate source of funding or support for the systematic review AND for each of the included studies.">

If heterogeneity exists a random effects model should be used and/or the clinical appropriateness of combining should be taken into consideration (i.e., is it sensible to combine?).

publication full text</span> (mean similarity 86.6%)</i></p>
<pre>
Here are my assessments of the methodological quality using AMSTAR and reporting quality using PRISMA for the given systematic review article:

A1. [Yes] <span title='Major quote deviation, possible hallucination. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 46.3%):

rehensive literature search was performed on the U.S. National Library of Medicine site in Medline and PubMed from 1 Ian 2000 to 31 Dec 2007 using keywords such as “laparoscopy and blunt abdominal trauma”.' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: red'>&quot;The study was designed as a systematic review. Relevant literature was identified by searching PubMed and Medline databases using the keywords “laparoscopy and blunt abdominal trauma” in the time interval between January 2000 and December 2007.&quot;</span> This indicates an a priori design with pre-defined research question and inclusion criteria.  

A2. [No] The authors do not mention duplicate study selection or data extraction.

A3. [Yes] <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;A comprehensive literature search was performed on the U.S. National Library of Medicine site in Medline and PubMed from 1 Ian 2000 to 31 Dec 2007 using keywords such as “laparoscopy and blunt abdominal trauma”.&quot;</span> Two electronic databases searched with keywords and date ranges provided.

A4. [No] The status of publication was not mentioned as an inclusion criterion. 

A5. [No] A list of included and excluded studies was not provided.

A6. [Yes] <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The articles have been grouped based on their scientific content: original studies on patients with multiples and single organ injuries, reviews, and case reports.&quot;</span> Characteristics of included studies provided in an aggregated form. 

A7. [No] The scientific quality of included studies was not assessed or documented.

A8. [NA] Since quality of studies was not assessed, it was not used in formulating conclusions.

A9. [NA] The studies were not combined quantitatively, so methods for assessing heterogeneity are not applicable.

A10. [No] Publication bias was not assessed.

A11. [No] Conflicts of interest were not reported for the systematic review or included studies.

P1. [Yes] <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Is laparoscopy still needed in blunt abdominal trauma?&quot;</span> Identified as a systematic review in the title.

P2. [Yes] Provides a structured abstract including background, objectives, data sources, methods, results, and conclusions. 

P3. [Yes] Describes the rationale and background for the review.

P4. [Yes] Specifies the research question looking at the role of laparoscopy in blunt abdominal trauma.

P5. [No] Does not mention a review protocol.

P6. [Yes] Specifies inclusion criteria and characteristics such as years considered, language, and excludes pediatric surgery, penetrating trauma, etc. 

P7. [Yes] Describes searching PubMed and Medline and provides the date range. 

P8. [No] Does not provide full search strategy.

P9. [Yes] Describes process of screening and selecting studies for inclusion and exclusion criteria.

P10. [No] Does not describe methods for data extraction. 

P11. [No] Does not list variables for which data were sought.

P12. [No] Does not describe methods for assessing risk of bias.

P13. [NA] Does not report summary measures since no meta-analysis was performed.

P14. [NA] Does not describe methods for combining data since no meta-analysis was performed. 

P15. [No] Does not assess risk of bias across studies.

P16. [NA] Does not report additional analyses since no meta-analysis was performed.

P17. [No] Does not provide numbers of studies screened and excluded with reasons.

P18. [Yes] Presents relevant characteristics of included studies in tables. 

P19. [No] Does not present risk of bias assessments. 

P20. [No] Does not present summary data and effect estimates for each study.

P21. [NA] No meta-analysis performed.

P22. [No] Does not assess risk of bias across studies. 

P23. [NA] No additional analyses performed.

P24. [Yes] Summarizes main findings and limitations.

P25. [Yes] Discusses limitations at the review level.

P26. [Yes] Provides interpretation of results and implications for future research.

P27. [No] Does not report sources of funding.</pre>

For the pooled results, a test should be done to ensure the studies were combinable, to assess their homogeneity (i.e., Chi-squared test for homogeneity, I2 ). If heterogeneity exists a random effects model should be used and/or the clinical appropriateness of combining should be taken into consideration (i.e., is it sensible to combine?).

An assessment of publication bias should include a combination of graphical aids (e.g., funnel plot, other available tests) and/or statistical tests (e.g., Egger regression test, Hedges-Olken). Note: If no test values or funnel plot included, score “no”. Score “yes” if mentions that publication bias could not be assessed because there were fewer than 10 included studies.">

For the pooled results, a test should be done to ensure the studies were combinable, to assess their homogeneity (i.e., Chi-squared test for homogeneity, I2 ). If heterogeneity exists a random effects model should be used and/or the clinical appropriateness of combining should be taken into consideration (i.e., is it sensible to combine?).

title="Were the methods used to combine the findings of studies appropriate? For the pooled results, a test should be done to ensure the studies were combinable, to assess their homogeneity (i.e., Chi-squared test for homogeneity, I2 ). If heterogeneity exists a random effects model should be used and/or the clinical appropriateness of combining should be taken into consideration (i.e., is it sensible to combine?). Note: Indicate “yes” if they mention or describe heterogeneity, i.e., if they explain that they cannot pool because of heterogeneity/variability between interventions.">

title="Was the likelihood of publication bias assessed? An assessment of publication bias should include a combination of graphical aids (e.g., funnel plot, other available tests) and/or statistical tests (e.g., Egger regression test, Hedges-Olken). Note: If no test values or funnel plot included, score “no”. Score “yes” if mentions that publication bias could not be assessed because there were fewer than 10 included studies.">

<th style="text-align:left;">
<span style="border-bottom: 1px dashed black"

Key words and/or MESH terms must be stated and where feasible the search strategy should be provided. All searches should be supplemented by consulting current contents, reviews, textbooks, specialized registers, or experts in the particular field of study, and by reviewing the references in the studies found. Note: If at least 2 sources + one supplementary strategy used, select “yes” (Cochrane register/Central counts as 2 sources; a grey literature search counts as supplementary).">

title="Was the status of publication (i.e. grey literature) used as an inclusion criterion? The authors should state that they searched for reports regardless of their publication type. The authors should state whether or not they excluded any reports (from the systematic review), based on their publication status, language etc. Note: If review indicates that there was a search for “grey literature” or “unpublished literature,” indicate “yes.” SIGLE database, dissertations, conference proceedings, and trial registries are all considered grey for this purpose. If searching a source that contains both grey and non-grey, must specify that they were searching for grey/unpublished lit.">

Note: Can include use of a quality scoring tool or checklist, e.g., Jadad scale, risk of bias, sensitivity analysis, etc., or a description of quality items, with some kind of result for EACH study (“low” or “high” is fine, as long as it is clear which studies scored “low” and which scored “high”; a summary score/range for all studies is not acceptable).">

For the pooled results, a test should be done to ensure the studies were combinable, to assess their homogeneity (i.e., Chi-squared test for homogeneity, I2 ). If heterogeneity exists a random effects model should be used and/or the clinical appropriateness of combining should be taken into consideration (i.e., is it sensible to combine?). Note: Indicate “yes” if they mention or describe heterogeneity, i.e., if they explain that they cannot pool because of heterogeneity/variability between interventions.">
A9</span>
</th>
<th style="text-align:left;">
<span style="border-bottom: 1px dashed black"
title="Was the likelihood of publication bias assessed? An assessment of publication bias should include a combination of graphical aids (e.g., funnel plot, other available tests) and/or statistical tests (e.g., Egger regression test, Hedges-Olken). Note: If no test values or funnel plot included, score “no”. Score “yes” if mentions that publication bias could not be assessed because there were fewer than 10 included studies.">
A10</span>

<th style="text-align:left;">
<span style="border-bottom: 1px dashed black"

Key words and/or MESH terms must be stated and where feasible the search strategy should be provided. All searches should be supplemented by consulting current contents, reviews, textbooks, specialized registers, or experts in the particular field of study, and by reviewing the references in the studies found.

title="Was the status of publication (i.e. grey literature) used as an inclusion criterion? The authors should state that they searched for reports regardless of their publication type. The authors should state whether or not they excluded any reports (from the systematic review), based on their publication status, language etc. Note: If review indicates that there was a search for “grey literature” or “unpublished literature,” indicate “yes.” SIGLE database, dissertations, conference proceedings, and trial registries are all considered grey for this purpose.

For the pooled results, a test should be done to ensure the studies were combinable, to assess their homogeneity (i.e., Chi-squared test for homogeneity, I2 ). If heterogeneity exists a random effects model should be used and/or the clinical appropriateness of combining should be taken into consideration (i.e., is it sensible to combine?).

An assessment of publication bias should include a combination of graphical aids (e.g., funnel plot, other available tests) and/or statistical tests (e.g., Egger regression test, Hedges-Olken). Note: If no test values or funnel plot included, score “no”. Score “yes” if mentions that publication bias could not be assessed because there were fewer than 10 included studies.">

Key words and/or MESH terms must be stated and where feasible the search strategy should be provided. All searches should be supplemented by consulting current contents, reviews, textbooks, specialized registers, or experts in the particular field of study, and by reviewing the references in the studies found. Note: If at least 2 sources + one supplementary strategy used, select “yes” (Cochrane register/Central counts as 2 sources; a grey literature search counts as supplementary).">

<span style="border-bottom: 1px dashed black"
title="Was the status of publication (i.e. grey literature) used as an inclusion criterion? The authors should state that they searched for reports regardless of their publication type. The authors should state whether or not they excluded any reports (from the systematic review), based on their publication status, language etc. Note: If review indicates that there was a search for “grey literature” or “unpublished literature,” indicate “yes.” SIGLE database, dissertations, conference proceedings, and trial registries are all considered grey for this purpose. If searching a source that contains both grey and non-grey, must specify that they were searching for grey/unpublished lit.">

In an aggregated form such as a table, data from the original studies should be provided on the participants, interventions and outcomes. The ranges of characteristics in all the studies analyzed e.g., age, race, sex, relevant socioeconomic data, disease status, duration, severity, or other diseases should be reported.

Note: Can include use of a quality scoring tool or checklist, e.g., Jadad scale, risk of bias, sensitivity analysis, etc., or a description of quality items, with some kind of result for EACH study (“low” or “high” is fine, as long as it is clear which studies scored “low” and which scored “high”; a summary score/range for all studies is not acceptable).">

The results of the methodological rigor and scientific quality should be considered in the analysis and the conclusions of the review, and explicitly stated in formulating recommendations.

A8</span>
</th>
<th style="text-align:left;">
<span style="border-bottom: 1px dashed black"
title="Were the methods used to combine the findings of studies appropriate? For the pooled results, a test should be done to ensure the studies were combinable, to assess their homogeneity (i.e., Chi-squared test for homogeneity, I2 ). If heterogeneity exists a random effects model should be used and/or the clinical appropriateness of combining should be taken into consideration (i.e., is it sensible to combine?). Note: Indicate “yes” if they mention or describe heterogeneity, i.e., if they explain that they cannot pool because of heterogeneity/variability between interventions.">
A9</span>
</th>
<th style="text-align:left;">
<span style="border-bottom: 1px dashed black"
title="Was the likelihood of publication bias assessed? An assessment of publication bias should include a combination of graphical aids (e.g., funnel plot, other available tests) and/or statistical tests (e.g., Egger regression test, Hedges-Olken). Note: If no test values or funnel plot included, score “no”. Score “yes” if mentions that publication bias could not be assessed because there were fewer than 10 included studies.">
A10</span>
</th>
<th style="text-align:left;">
<span style="border-bottom: 1px dashed black"
title="Was the conflict of interest included? Potential sources of support should be clearly acknowledged in both the systematic review and the included studies. Note: To get a “yes,” must indicate source of funding or support for the systematic review AND for each of the included studies.">

Key words and/or MESH terms must be stated and where feasible the search strategy should be provided. All searches should be supplemented by consulting current contents, reviews, textbooks, specialized registers, or experts in the particular field of study, and by reviewing the references in the studies found. Note: If at least 2 sources + one supplementary strategy used, select “yes” (Cochrane register/Central counts as 2 sources; a grey literature search counts as supplementary).">

title="Was the status of publication (i.e. grey literature) used as an inclusion criterion? The authors should state that they searched for reports regardless of their publication type. The authors should state whether or not they excluded any reports (from the systematic review), based on their publication status, language etc. Note: If review indicates that there was a search for “grey literature” or “unpublished literature,” indicate “yes.” SIGLE database, dissertations, conference proceedings, and trial registries are all considered grey for this purpose.

For the pooled results, a test should be done to ensure the studies were combinable, to assess their homogeneity (i.e., Chi-squared test for homogeneity, I2 ). If heterogeneity exists a random effects model should be used and/or the clinical appropriateness of combining should be taken into consideration (i.e., is it sensible to combine?). Note: Indicate “yes” if they mention or describe heterogeneity, i.e., if they explain that they cannot pool because of heterogeneity/variability between interventions.">
A9</span>

<th style="text-align:left;">
<span style="border-bottom: 1px dashed black"
title="Was the likelihood of publication bias assessed? An assessment of publication bias should include a combination of graphical aids (e.g., funnel plot, other available tests) and/or statistical tests (e.g., Egger regression test, Hedges-Olken). Note: If no test values or funnel plot included, score “no”. Score “yes” if mentions that publication bias could not be assessed because there were fewer than 10 included studies.">

<th style="text-align:left;">
<span style="border-bottom: 1px dashed black"

For the pooled results, a test should be done to ensure the studies were combinable, to assess their homogeneity (i.e., Chi-squared test for homogeneity, I2 ). If heterogeneity exists a random effects model should be used and/or the clinical appropriateness of combining should be taken into consideration (i.e., is it sensible to combine?).

An assessment of publication bias should include a combination of graphical aids (e.g., funnel plot, other available tests) and/or statistical tests (e.g., Egger regression test, Hedges-Olken). Note: If no test values or funnel plot included, score “no”. Score “yes” if mentions that publication bias could not be assessed because there were fewer than 10 included studies.">

The results of the methodological rigor and scientific quality should be considered in the analysis and the conclusions of the review, and explicitly stated in formulating recommendations.

For the pooled results, a test should be done to ensure the studies were combinable, to assess their homogeneity (i.e., Chi-squared test for homogeneity, I2 ). If heterogeneity exists a random effects model should be used and/or the clinical appropriateness of combining should be taken into consideration (i.e., is it sensible to combine?).

In summary, based on the AMSTAR assessment, this systematic review has some methodological shortcomings related to duplicate study selection/data extraction, literature search, incorporation of quality assessment into conclusions, and assessment of publication bias. The reporting quality based on PRISMA also has some deficiencies, including lack of protocol and search strategy details. Overall, this review could be improved with more rigorous methodology and transparent reporting.

</file-attachment-contents>

Thank you for the comprehensive assessment using the AMSTAR and PRISMA tools. You have highlighted several limitations in the methodology and reporting of this systematic review. The lack of duplicate study selection/data extraction, limited literature searching, and no assessment of publication bias per AMSTAR are concerning. Not providing the full search strategy per PRISMA also reduces reproducibility. Your analysis provides helpful insights on improving systematic review conduct and reporting quality. Assessing rigor is a key step before using findings to inform evidence-based practice.</pre>

title="Were the methods used to combine the findings of studies appropriate? For the pooled results, a test should be done to ensure the studies were combinable, to assess their homogeneity (i.e., Chi-squared test for homogeneity, I2 ). If heterogeneity exists a random effects model should be used and/or the clinical appropriateness of combining should be taken into consideration (i.e., is it sensible to combine?). Note: Indicate “yes” if they mention or describe heterogeneity, i.e., if they explain that they cannot pool because of heterogeneity/variability between interventions.">
A9</span>
</th>
<th style="text-align:left;">
<span style="border-bottom: 1px dashed black"
title="Was the likelihood of publication bias assessed? An assessment of publication bias should include a combination of graphical aids (e.g., funnel plot, other available tests) and/or statistical tests (e.g., Egger regression test, Hedges-Olken). Note: If no test values or funnel plot included, score “no”. Score “yes” if mentions that publication bias could not be assessed because there were fewer than 10 included studies.">

For the pooled results, a test should be done to ensure the studies were combinable, to assess their homogeneity (i.e., Chi-squared test for homogeneity, I2 ). If heterogeneity exists a random effects model should be used and/or the clinical appropriateness of combining should be taken into consideration (i.e., is it sensible to combine?).

title="Was the likelihood of publication bias assessed? An assessment of publication bias should include a combination of graphical aids (e.g., funnel plot, other available tests) and/or statistical tests (e.g., Egger regression test, Hedges-Olken). Note: If no test values or funnel plot included, score “no”. Score “yes” if mentions that publication bias could not be assessed because there were fewer than 10 included studies.">

For the pooled results, a test should be done to ensure the studies were combinable, to assess their homogeneity (i.e., Chi-squared test for homogeneity, I2 ). If heterogeneity exists a random effects model should be used and/or the clinical appropriateness of combining should be taken into consideration (i.e., is it sensible to combine?). Note: Indicate “yes” if they mention or describe heterogeneity, i.e., if they explain that they cannot pool because of heterogeneity/variability between interventions.">

title="Was the likelihood of publication bias assessed? An assessment of publication bias should include a combination of graphical aids (e.g., funnel plot, other available tests) and/or statistical tests (e.g., Egger regression test, Hedges-Olken). Note: If no test values or funnel plot included, score “no”. Score “yes” if mentions that publication bias could not be assessed because there were fewer than 10 included studies.">

<pre>
Here are the AMSTAR and PRISMA assessments for the given systematic review:

# AMSTAR
A1. Was an 'a priori' design provided? The research question and inclusion criteria should be established before the conduct of the review. Note: Need to refer to a protocol, ethics approval, or pre-determined/a priori published research objectives to score a “yes.”
"[No]" - No mention of protocol or pre-determined objectives.

A2. Was there duplicate study selection and data extraction? There should be at least two independent data extractors and a consensus procedure for disagreements should be in place. Note: 2 people do study selection, 2 people do data extraction, consensus process or one person checks the other’s work.  
"[No]" - No mention of duplicate study selection or data extraction process.

A3. Was a comprehensive literature search performed? At least two electronic sources should be searched. The report must include years and databases used (e.g., Central, EMBASE, and MEDLINE). Key words and/or MESH terms must be stated and where feasible the search strategy should be provided. All searches should be supplemented by consulting current contents, reviews, textbooks, specialized registers, or experts in the particular field of study, and by reviewing the references in the studies found. Note: If at least 2 sources + one supplementary strategy used, select “yes” (Cochrane register/Central counts as 2 sources; a grey literature search counts as supplementary).
"[Yes]" - Searched MEDLINE, EMbase, Google Scholar. Also searched journals and reference lists."

A4. Was the status of publication (i.e. grey literature) used as an inclusion criterion? The authors should state that they searched for reports regardless of their publication type. The authors should state whether or not they excluded any reports (from the systematic review), based on their publication status, language etc. Note: If review indicates that there was a search for “grey literature” or “unpublished literature,” indicate “yes.” SIGLE database, dissertations, conference proceedings, and trial registries are all considered grey for this purpose. If searching a source that contains both grey and non-grey, must specify that they were searching for grey/unpublished lit.  
"[No]" - No mention of including or searching for grey literature.

A5. Was a list of studies (included and excluded) provided? A list of included and excluded studies should be provided. Note: Acceptable if the excluded studies are referenced. If there is an electronic link to the list but the link is dead, select “no.”
"[No]" - No list of excluded studies provided. 

A6. Were the characteristics of the included studies provided? In an aggregated form such as a table, data from the original studies should be provided on the participants, interventions and outcomes. The ranges of characteristics in all the studies analyzed e.g., age, race, sex, relevant socioeconomic data, disease status, duration, severity, or other diseases should be reported. Note: Acceptable if not in table format as long as they are described as above. Paul <span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Follow-up poorly reported in general&quot;</span>
"[Yes]" - Table 1 provides characteristics of included studies. Follow-up duration is poorly reported.

A7. Was the scientific quality of the included studies assessed and documented? 'A priori' methods of assessment should be provided (e.g., for effectiveness studies if the author(s) chose to include only randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled studies, or allocation concealment as inclusion criteria); for other types of studies alternative items will be relevant. Note: Can include use of a quality scoring tool or checklist, e.g., Jadad scale, risk of bias, sensitivity analysis, etc., or a description of quality items, with some kind of result for EACH study (“low” or “high” is fine, as long as it is clear which studies scored “low” and which scored “high”; a summary score/range for all studies is not acceptable).  
"[No]" - No quality assessment of included studies.

A8. Was the scientific quality of the included studies used appropriately in formulating conclusions? The results of the methodological rigor and scientific quality should be considered in the analysis and the conclusions of the review, and explicitly stated in formulating recommendations. Note: Might say something such as “the results should be interpreted with caution due to poor quality of included studies.” Cannot score “yes” for this question if scored “no” for question A7.  
"[No]" - Did not assess quality of included studies.

A9. Were the methods used to combine the findings of studies appropriate? For the pooled results, a test should be done to ensure the studies were combinable, to assess their homogeneity (i.e., Chi-squared test for homogeneity, I2 ). If heterogeneity exists a random effects model should be used and/or the clinical appropriateness of combining should be taken into consideration (i.e., is it sensible to combine?). Note: Indicate “yes” if they mention or describe heterogeneity, i.e., if they explain that they cannot pool because of heterogeneity/variability between interventions.
"[NA]" - No meta-analysis performed.

A10. Was the likelihood of publication bias assessed? An assessment of publication bias should include a combination of graphical aids (e.g., funnel plot, other available tests) and/or statistical tests (e.g., Egger regression test, Hedges-Olken). Note: If no test values or funnel plot included, score “no”. Score “yes” if mentions that publication bias could not be assessed because there were fewer than 10 included studies.  
"[NA]" - No meta-analysis performed.

A11. Was the conflict of interest included? Potential sources of support should be clearly acknowledged in both the systematic review and the included studies. Note: To get a “yes,” must indicate source of funding or support for the systematic review AND for each of the included studies.
"[No]" - No conflict of interest statement.

<pre>
Here are the AMSTAR and PRISMA assessments for the systematic review:

A1. Was an 'a priori' design provided? 
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;To identify all publications comparing LAP versus open surgery for intussusception in children, two researchers independently searched the electronic databases MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, and the Cochrane Library, using the MeSH terms ‘intussusception,’ ‘pediatric,’ and ‘laparoscopic.’&quot;</span>
This indicates there was an a priori protocol. [Yes]

A2. Was there duplicate study selection and data extraction?
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Two researchers independently screened the title and abstract of identified articles for potential eligibility and retrieved the full-text version of all articles deemed relevant.&quot;</span>
This indicates duplicate study selection. [Yes]

A3. Was a comprehensive literature search performed?
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;To identify all publications comparing LAP versus open surgery for intussusception in children, two researchers independently searched the electronic databases MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, and the Cochrane Library, using the MeSH terms ‘intussusception,’ ‘pediatric,’ and ‘laparoscopic.’&quot;</span>
At least 2 databases were searched. [Yes]

A1. Was an 'a priori' design provided? [Yes]
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;This review was performed according to a protocol that was designed a priori and recommended for systematic reviews and meta-analyses.&quot;</span>
The review had a protocol designed before conducting the review. 

A2. Was there duplicate study selection and data extraction? [Yes]  
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Two authors reviewed all the abstracts independently. Agreement regarding potential relevance was reached by consensus. Full-text copies of potentially eligible papers were obtained, and the same 2 reviewers independently extracted relevant data on study characteristics and the outcomes of interest.&quot;</span>
Two reviewers independently performed study selection and data extraction.

A3. Was a comprehensive literature search performed? [Yes]
<span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 98.6%):

All searches should be supplemented by consulting current contents, reviews, textbooks, specialized registers, or experts in the particular field of study, and by reviewing the references in the studies found.

For the pooled results, a test should be done to ensure the studies were combinable, to assess their homogeneity (i.e., Chi-squared test for homogeneity, I2 ). If heterogeneity exists a random effects model should be used and/or the clinical appropriateness of combining should be taken into consideration (i.e., is it sensible to combine?).

title="Was the likelihood of publication bias assessed? An assessment of publication bias should include a combination of graphical aids (e.g., funnel plot, other available tests) and/or statistical tests (e.g., Egger regression test, Hedges-Olken). Note: If no test values or funnel plot included, score “no”. Score “yes” if mentions that publication bias could not be assessed because there were fewer than 10 included studies.">

For the pooled results, a test should be done to ensure the studies were combinable, to assess their homogeneity (i.e., Chi-squared test for homogeneity, I2 ). If heterogeneity exists a random effects model should be used and/or the clinical appropriateness of combining should be taken into consideration (i.e., is it sensible to combine?).

An assessment of publication bias should include a combination of graphical aids (e.g., funnel plot, other available tests) and/or statistical tests (e.g., Egger regression test, Hedges-Olken). Note: If no test values or funnel plot included, score “no”. Score “yes” if mentions that publication bias could not be assessed because there were fewer than 10 included studies.">

title="Was an &#39;a priori&#39; design provided? The research question and inclusion criteria should be established before the conduct of the review. Note: Need to refer to a protocol, ethics approval, or pre-determined/a priori published research objectives to score a “yes.”">
A1</span>
</th>
<th style="text-align:left;">
<span style="border-bottom: 1px dashed black"
title="Was there duplicate study selection and data extraction? There should be at least two independent data extractors and a consensus procedure for disagreements should be in place. Note: 2 people do study selection, 2 people do data extraction, consensus process or one person checks the other’s work.">
A2</span>
</th>
<th style="text-align:left;">
<span style="border-bottom: 1px dashed black"
title="Was a comprehensive literature search performed? At least two electronic sources should be searched. The report must include years and databases used (e.g., Central, EMBASE, and MEDLINE). Key words and/or MESH terms must be stated and where feasible the search strategy should be provided. All searches should be supplemented by consulting current contents, reviews, textbooks, specialized registers, or experts in the particular field of study, and by reviewing the references in the studies found. Note: If at least 2 sources + one supplementary strategy used, select “yes” (Cochrane register/Central counts as 2 sources; a grey literature search counts as supplementary).">
A3</span>
</th>
<th style="text-align:left;">
<span style="border-bottom: 1px dashed black"
title="Was the status of publication (i.e. grey literature) used as an inclusion criterion? The authors should state that they searched for reports regardless of their publication type. The authors should state whether or not they excluded any reports (from the systematic review), based on their publication status, language etc. Note: If review indicates that there was a search for “grey literature” or “unpublished literature,” indicate “yes.” SIGLE database, dissertations, conference proceedings, and trial registries are all considered grey for this purpose. If searching a source that contains both grey and non-grey, must specify that they were searching for grey/unpublished lit.">

<th style="text-align:left;">
<span style="border-bottom: 1px dashed black"

<th style="text-align:left;">
<span style="border-bottom: 1px dashed black"
title="Were the characteristics of the included studies provided? In an aggregated form such as a table, data from the original studies should be provided on the participants, interventions and outcomes. The ranges of characteristics in all the studies analyzed e.g., age, race, sex, relevant socioeconomic data, disease status, duration, severity, or other diseases should be reported. Note: Acceptable if not in table format as long as they are described as above. Paul “Follow-up poorly reported in general”">
A6</span>
</th>
<th style="text-align:left;">
<span style="border-bottom: 1px dashed black"
title="Was the scientific quality of the included studies assessed and documented? &#39;A priori&#39; methods of assessment should be provided (e.g., for effectiveness studies if the author(s) chose to include only randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled studies, or allocation concealment as inclusion criteria); for other types of studies alternative items will be relevant. Note: Can include use of a quality scoring tool or checklist, e.g., Jadad scale, risk of bias, sensitivity analysis, etc., or a description of quality items, with some kind of result for EACH study (“low” or “high” is fine, as long as it is clear which studies scored “low” and which scored “high”; a summary score/range for all studies is not acceptable).">

</th>
<th style="text-align:left;">
<span style="border-bottom: 1px dashed black"
title="Was the scientific quality of the included studies used appropriately in formulating conclusions? The results of the methodological rigor and scientific quality should be considered in the analysis and the conclusions of the review, and explicitly stated in formulating recommendations. Note: Might say something such as “the results should be interpreted with caution due to poor quality of included studies.” Cannot score “yes” for this question if scored “no” for question A7.">
A8</span>
</th>
<th style="text-align:left;">
<span style="border-bottom: 1px dashed black"
title="Were the methods used to combine the findings of studies appropriate? For the pooled results, a test should be done to ensure the studies were combinable, to assess their homogeneity (i.e., Chi-squared test for homogeneity, I2 ). If heterogeneity exists a random effects model should be used and/or the clinical appropriateness of combining should be taken into consideration (i.e., is it sensible to combine?). Note: Indicate “yes” if they mention or describe heterogeneity, i.e., if they explain that they cannot pool because of heterogeneity/variability between interventions.">
A9</span>
</th>
<th style="text-align:left;">
<span style="border-bottom: 1px dashed black"
title="Was the likelihood of publication bias assessed? An assessment of publication bias should include a combination of graphical aids (e.g., funnel plot, other available tests) and/or statistical tests (e.g., Egger regression test, Hedges-Olken). Note: If no test values or funnel plot included, score “no”. Score “yes” if mentions that publication bias could not be assessed because there were fewer than 10 included studies.">
A10</span>
</th>
<th style="text-align:left;">
<span style="border-bottom: 1px dashed black"
title="Was the conflict of interest included? Potential sources of support should be clearly acknowledged in both the systematic review and the included studies. Note: To get a “yes,” must indicate source of funding or support for the systematic review AND for each of the included studies.">

For the pooled results, a test should be done to ensure the studies were combinable, to assess their homogeneity (i.e., Chi-squared test for homogeneity, I2 ). If heterogeneity exists a random effects model should be used and/or the clinical appropriateness of combining should be taken into consideration (i.e., is it sensible to combine?). Note: Indicate “yes” if they mention or describe heterogeneity, i.e., if they explain that they cannot pool because of heterogeneity/variability between interventions.">

An assessment of publication bias should include a combination of graphical aids (e.g., funnel plot, other available tests) and/or statistical tests (e.g., Egger regression test, Hedges-Olken). Note: If no test values or funnel plot included, score “no”. Score “yes” if mentions that publication bias could not be assessed because there were fewer than 10 included studies.">

For the pooled results, a test should be done to ensure the studies were combinable, to assess their homogeneity (i.e., Chi-squared test for homogeneity, I2 ). If heterogeneity exists a random effects model should be used and/or the clinical appropriateness of combining should be taken into consideration (i.e., is it sensible to combine?).

title="Was the likelihood of publication bias assessed? An assessment of publication bias should include a combination of graphical aids (e.g., funnel plot, other available tests) and/or statistical tests (e.g., Egger regression test, Hedges-Olken). Note: If no test values or funnel plot included, score “no”. Score “yes” if mentions that publication bias could not be assessed because there were fewer than 10 included studies.">

publication full text</span> (mean similarity 100%)</i></p>
<pre>
Here is my assessment of the systematic review using AMSTAR and PRISMA 2009:

A1. Was an 'a priori' design provided? 
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;We conducted a comprehensive search of MEDLINE®, Embase, CINAHL, SciELO, CENTRAL, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and reference lists of prominent studies from 1990 to 2010.&quot;</span> [Yes]

A2. Was there duplicate study selection and data extraction?
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Title and abstract screening was conducted independently by 2 authors to select all citations that might contain comparisons of interest. Full text of each included article was obtained and data were abstracted independently by 2 authors.&quot;</span> [Yes]

A3. Was a comprehensive literature search performed?
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;We conducted a comprehensive search of MEDLINE®, Embase, CINAHL, SciELO, CENTRAL, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and reference lists of prominent studies from 1990 to 2010.&quot;</span> [Yes]

[Yes]

A8. Was the scientific quality of the included studies used appropriately in formulating conclusions?
The discussion mentions the included studies were mostly retrospective observational studies of low to moderate quality. [Yes]  

A9. Were the methods used to combine the findings of studies appropriate?
Four studies were pooled in a meta-analysis using a random effects model. No test for heterogeneity mentioned. [No]

A10. Was the likelihood of publication bias assessed?

No mention of sources of funding. [No]

In summary, this systematic review meets most of the AMSTAR and PRISMA criteria, with some room for improvement in reporting the search strategy, assessing heterogeneity, reporting exclusion reasons, and declaring conflicts of interest. The major limitations are the lack of a published protocol, limited assessment of heterogeneity in the meta-analysis, and not reporting the sources of funding and support.</pre>

For the pooled results, a test should be done to ensure the studies were combinable, to assess their homogeneity (i.e., Chi-squared test for homogeneity, I2 ). If heterogeneity exists a random effects model should be used and/or the clinical appropriateness of combining should be taken into consideration (i.e., is it sensible to combine?).

Key words and/or MESH terms must be stated and where feasible the search strategy should be provided. All searches should be supplemented by consulting current contents, reviews, textbooks, specialized registers, or experts in the particular field of study, and by reviewing the references in the studies found. Note: If at least 2 sources + one supplementary strategy used, select “yes” (Cochrane register/Central counts as 2 sources; a grey literature search counts as supplementary).">

<span style="border-bottom: 1px dashed black"
title="Was the status of publication (i.e. grey literature) used as an inclusion criterion? The authors should state that they searched for reports regardless of their publication type. The authors should state whether or not they excluded any reports (from the systematic review), based on their publication status, language etc. Note: If review indicates that there was a search for “grey literature” or “unpublished literature,” indicate “yes.” SIGLE database, dissertations, conference proceedings, and trial registries are all considered grey for this purpose. If searching a source that contains both grey and non-grey, must specify that they were searching for grey/unpublished lit.">

The ranges of characteristics in all the studies analyzed e.g., age, race, sex, relevant socioeconomic data, disease status, duration, severity, or other diseases should be reported.

title="Were the methods used to combine the findings of studies appropriate? For the pooled results, a test should be done to ensure the studies were combinable, to assess their homogeneity (i.e., Chi-squared test for homogeneity, I2 ). If heterogeneity exists a random effects model should be used and/or the clinical appropriateness of combining should be taken into consideration (i.e., is it sensible to combine?). Note: Indicate “yes” if they mention or describe heterogeneity, i.e., if they explain that they cannot pool because of heterogeneity/variability between interventions.">
A9</span>

<th style="text-align:left;">
<span style="border-bottom: 1px dashed black"
title="Was the likelihood of publication bias assessed? An assessment of publication bias should include a combination of graphical aids (e.g., funnel plot, other available tests) and/or statistical tests (e.g., Egger regression test, Hedges-Olken). Note: If no test values or funnel plot included, score “no”. Score “yes” if mentions that publication bias could not be assessed because there were fewer than 10 included studies.">
A10</span>
</th>
<th style="text-align:left;">
<span style="border-bottom: 1px dashed black"

If searching a source that contains both grey and non-grey, must specify that they were searching for grey/unpublished lit.  \n\nQuotes: None provided.\n\nReasoning: The review did not mention searching for grey literature or unpublished studies. \n\nResponse: [No]\n\nA5. Was a list of studies (included and excluded) provided? A list of included and excluded studies should be provided. Note: Acceptable if the excluded studies are referenced. If there is an electronic link to the list but the link is dead, select “no.”\n\nQuotes: \n- 'Finally, n = 39 articles with useable information (LILT n = 24 articles, STEP n = 15 articles), including n = 472 patients (LILT n = 363 patients, STEP n = 109 patients) remained to be analyzed and are reviewed here (Table 1).'\n- Table 1 lists the included studies.\n\nReasoning: The review provided a list of included studies in Table 1. No list of excluded studies was provided.\n\nResponse: [No]\n\nA6. Were the characteristics of the included studies provided? In an aggregated form such as a table, data from the original studies should be provided on the participants, interventions and outcomes. The ranges of characteristics in all the studies analyzed e.g., age, race, sex, relevant socioeconomic data, disease status, duration, severity, or other diseases should be reported. Note: Acceptable if not in table format as long as they are described as above.  \n\nQuotes: \n- 'Included studies revealed significant methodological and clinical heterogeneity. Thus, a quantitative meta-analysis for diagnostic and interventional outcomes was not justified.'\n- The results section provides aggregated data on participant characteristics, interventions, and outcomes. \n\nReasoning: The review provided aggregated data on participants, interventions, and outcomes in the results section. However, no table summarizing study characteristics was provided.\n\nResponse: [Yes]\n\nA7. Was the scientific quality of the included studies assessed and documented? 'A priori' methods of assessment should be provided (e.g., for effectiveness studies if the author(s) chose to include only randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled studies, or allocation concealment as inclusion criteria); for other types of studies alternative items will be relevant. Note: Can include use of a quality scoring tool or checklist, e.g., Jadad scale, risk of bias, sensitivity analysis, etc., or a description of quality items, with some kind of result for EACH study (“low” or “high” is fine, as long as it is clear which studies scored “low” and which scored “high”; a summary score/range for all studies is not acceptable).  \n\nQuotes: \n- 'There were no randomized trials in our review. In all 39 reviewed case series the data had been retrospectively analyzed.' \n- 'Included studies revealed significant methodological and clinical heterogeneity. Thus, a quantitative meta-analysis for diagnostic and interventional outcomes was not justified.'\n\nReasoning: The review stated that all included studies were retrospective case series. No quality assessment of individual studies was documented. \n\nResponse: [No]\n\nA8. Was the scientific quality of the included studies used appropriately in formulating conclusions? The results of the methodological rigor and scientific quality should be considered in the analysis and the conclusions of the review, and explicitly stated in formulating recommendations. Note: Might say something such as “the results should be interpreted with caution due to poor quality of included studies.” Cannot score “yes” for this question if scored “no” for question A7.\n\nQuotes: None provided. \n\nReasoning: The quality of included studies was not assessed or considered in formulating conclusions.\n\nResponse: [No]\n\nA9. Were the methods used to combine the findings of studies appropriate? For the pooled results, a test should be done to ensure the studies were combinable, to assess their homogeneity (i.e., Chi-squared test for homogeneity, I2). If heterogeneity exists a random effects model should be used and/or the clinical appropriateness of combining should be taken into consideration (i.e., is it sensible to combine?). Note: Indicate “yes” if they mention or describe heterogeneity, i.e., if they explain that they cannot pool because of heterogeneity/variability between interventions.\n\nQuotes:  \n- 'Included studies revealed significant methodological and clinical heterogeneity. Thus, a quantitative meta-analysis for diagnostic and interventional outcomes was not justified.'\n\nReasoning: The review did not perform a quantitative synthesis due to heterogeneity between studies.\n\nResponse: [NA]\n\nA10. Was the likelihood of publication bias assessed? An assessment of publication bias should include a combination of graphical aids (e.g., funnel plot, other available tests) and/or statistical tests (e.g., Egger regression test, Hedges-Olken). Note: If no test values or funnel plot included, score “no”. Score “yes” if mentions that publication bias could not be assessed because there were fewer than 10 included studies.  \n\nQuotes: None provided.\n\nReasoning: The review did not assess publication bias.\n\nResponse: [No]\n\nA11. Was the conflict of interest included? Potential sources of support should be clearly acknowledged in both the systematic review and the included studies. Note: To get a “yes,” must indicate source of funding or support for the systematic review AND for each of the included studies.\n\nQuotes:  \n- 'Conflict of interest: None.'\n\nReasoning: Sources of support were reported for the review but not for the individual studies included. \n\nResponse: [No]\n\nP1. Identify the report as a systematic review, meta-analysis, or both.  \n\nQuotes:\n- 'Comparison of LILT and STEP procedures in children with short bowel syndrome — A systematic review of the literature' (Title)\n\nReasoning: The report is identified as a systematic review in the title.\n\nResponse: [Yes]\n\nP2.

Describe the rationale for the review in the context of what is already known.\n\nQuotes:\n- 'The first pivotal aim in the therapy of SBS is to ensure alimentation of the child by parenteral nutrition (PN), which results in significant improvements in mortality rates and improved thrive and quality of life in paediatric SBS [65,66]. Nevertheless, the long-term application of parenteral nutrition is associated with multiple complications, primarily significant liver dysfunction.'\n- 'Further surgical approaches can be subdivided into autologous intestinal reconstruction procedures and small bowel transplantation (SBTX). The two main autologous intestinal reconstruction procedures applied today are the Longitudinal Intestinal Lengthening and Tailoring (LILT) and the Serial Transverse Enteroplasty (STEP) [54].' \n\nReasoning: The introduction provides background on SBS and the rationale for surgical procedures like LILT and STEP.\n\nResponse: [Yes]\n\nP4. Provide an explicit statement of questions being addressed with reference to participants, interventions, comparisons, outcomes, and study design (PICOS).  \n\nQuotes: \n- 'The present review highlights most of these basic issues, first giving an overview of autologous intestinal reconstruction procedures with emphasis on LILT and STEP, then an insight into indications criteria for LILT and STEP and finally a comparison of associated outcome of both procedures from published data in children.' (Objectives)\n\nParticipants: Children with short bowel syndrome\nInterventions: LILT, STEP \nComparisons: Comparison of LILT and STEP\nOutcomes: Outcomes like complications, bowel lengthening, etc. \nStudy design: Case series\n\nReasoning: The objectives specify the intent to compare LILT and STEP in children with SBS. The participants, interventions, comparisons, and outcomes are clear from the text.\n\nResponse: [Yes]\n\nP5. Indicate if a review protocol exists, if and where it can be accessed (e.g., Web address), and, if available, provide registration information including registration number.\n\nQuotes: None provided.\n\nReasoning: The review did not mention a protocol.\n\nResponse: [No]\n\nP6. Specify study characteristics (e.g., PICOS, length of follow-up) and report characteristics (e.g., years considered, language, publication status) used as criteria for eligibility, giving rationale.\n\nQuotes:\n- 'Inclusion and exclusion criteria: The articles were included in this review if they met the following criteria: Population: Studies of humans aged 0–18 years. Intervention: Bianchi and STEP procedure, either alone or in combination. Type of study: All study designs were eligible for inclusion. Case series with 1 or more cases were included.' \n\nReasoning: The inclusion and exclusion criteria specify population, interventions, and study designs included.\n\nResponse: [Yes]\n\nP7. Describe all information sources (e.g., databases with dates of coverage, contact with study authors to identify additional studies) in the search and date last searched.\n\nQuotes:  \n- 'A systematic literature search was carried out using the search terms “bowel lengthening”, “intestinal lengthening”, “longitudinal intestinal lengthening and tailoring”, “LILT”, “Bianchi procedure”, “serial transverse enteroplasty” and “step procedure”. The last search was done on December, 10th, 2012.'\n- 'The reference lists of retrieved relevant articles were also cross-screened for additional studies.'\n\nReasoning: The information sources searched are described, but details of databases and platforms are not provided. The date of last search is provided. \n\nResponse: [No]\n\nP8. Present full electronic search strategy for at least one database, including any limits used, such that it could be repeated.  \n\nQuotes: The search strategy is not provided for any database.\n\nReasoning: The full search strategy for any database was not presented.\n\nResponse: [No]\n\nP9. State the process for selecting studies (i.e., screening, eligibility, included in systematic review, and, if applicable, included in the meta-analysis).\n\nQuotes:  \n- 'One reviewer (GF) screened all titles and abstracts to assess whether each report was potentially eligible for inclusion, and whether or not the full text was available. Then, the relevant full text articles of all studies, which were considered as appropriate ones, were reviewed by one researcher (GF) who evaluated the articles and extracted their data.' \n\nReasoning: The process for screening and selecting studies is described.\n\nResponse: [Yes] \n\nP10. Describe method of data extraction from reports (e.g., piloted forms, independently, in duplicate) and any processes for obtaining and confirming data from investigators.\n\nQuotes:  \n- 'Then, the relevant full text articles of all studies, which were considered as appropriate ones, were reviewed by one researcher (GF) who evaluated the articles and extracted their data. Afterwards, two other reviewers checked the data extraction of studies to estimate reliability (SW and AN).'\n\nReasoning: The method of data extraction is described - one author extracted data initially which was checked by two others. \n\nResponse: [Yes]\n\nP11. List and define all variables for which data were sought (e.g., PICOS, funding sources) and any assumptions and simplifications made.\n\nQuotes: \n- The results section provides data extracted for variables such as age, anatomy, complications, outcomes etc. \n\nReasoning: The key variables like participant characteristics, interventions, and outcomes are listed and defined in the results section.\n\nResponse: [Yes]\n\nP12. Describe methods used for assessing risk of bias of individual studies (including specification of whether this was done at the study or outcome level), and how this information is to be used in any data synthesis.\n\nQuotes:  \n- 'There were no randomized trials in our review. In all 39 reviewed case series the data had been retrospectively analyzed.'\n\nReasoning: The review did not assess risk of bias in individual studies.\n\nResponse: [No]\n\nP13. State the principal summary measures (e.g., risk ratio, difference in means).\n\nQuotes: \n- 'Mean %-values indicated in this review were calculated from all %-values of the respective item published within reviewed reports.'\n\nReasoning: The principal summary measure (mean) is stated. \n\nResponse: [Yes] \n\nP14. Describe the methods of handling data and combining results of studies, if done, including measures of consistency (e.g., I2) for each meta-analysis.\n\nQuotes:\n- 'Included studies revealed significant methodological and clinical heterogeneity. Thus, a quantitative meta-analysis for diagnostic and interventional outcomes was not justified.'\n\nReasoning: The review did not perform a quantitative synthesis.\n\nResponse: [NA]\n\nP15. Specify any assessment of risk of bias that may affect the cumulative evidence (e.g., publication bias, selective reporting within studies). \n\nQuotes: None provided.\n\nReasoning: Assessment of risk of bias was not performed. \n\nResponse: [No]\n\nP16. Describe methods of additional analyses (e.g., sensitivity or subgroup analyses, meta-regression), if done, indicating which were pre-specified.\n\nQuotes: No additional analyses were done.\n\nReasoning: No additional analyses were performed.\n\nResponse: [NA]\n\nP17.

<h4>User prompt</h4>
<pre>
You are an expert in systematic reviews and are tasked to assess the methodological quality of a systematic review with the AMSTAR tool and its reporting quality with the PRISMA 2009 tool based on the full text of its publication. AMSTAR and PRISMA 2009 consist of the following items:

---
# AMSTAR
A1. Was an 'a priori' design provided? The research question and inclusion criteria should be established before the conduct of the review. Note: Need to refer to a protocol, ethics approval, or pre-determined/a priori published research objectives to score a “yes.”
A2. Was there duplicate study selection and data extraction? There should be at least two independent data extractors and a consensus procedure for disagreements should be in place. Note: 2 people do study selection, 2 people do data extraction, consensus process or one person checks the other’s work.
A3. Was a comprehensive literature search performed? At least two electronic sources should be searched. The report must include years and databases used (e.g., Central, EMBASE, and MEDLINE). Key words and/or MESH terms must be stated and where feasible the search strategy should be provided. All searches should be supplemented by consulting current contents, reviews, textbooks, specialized registers, or experts in the particular field of study, and by reviewing the references in the studies found. Note: If at least 2 sources + one supplementary strategy used, select “yes” (Cochrane register/Central counts as 2 sources; a grey literature search counts as supplementary).
A4. Was the status of publication (i.e. grey literature) used as an inclusion criterion? The authors should state that they searched for reports regardless of their publication type. The authors should state whether or not they excluded any reports (from the systematic review), based on their publication status, language etc. Note: If review indicates that there was a search for “grey literature” or “unpublished literature,” indicate “yes.” SIGLE database, dissertations, conference proceedings, and trial registries are all considered grey for this purpose. If searching a source that contains both grey and non-grey, must specify that they were searching for grey/unpublished lit.
A5. Was a list of studies (included and excluded) provided? A list of included and excluded studies should be provided. Note: Acceptable if the excluded studies are referenced. If there is an electronic link to the list but the link is dead, select “no.”
A6. Were the characteristics of the included studies provided? In an aggregated form such as a table, data from the original studies should be provided on the participants, interventions and outcomes. The ranges of characteristics in all the studies analyzed e.g., age, race, sex, relevant socioeconomic data, disease status, duration, severity, or other diseases should be reported. Note: Acceptable if not in table format as long as they are described as above. Paul "Follow-up poorly reported in general"
A7. Was the scientific quality of the included studies assessed and documented? 'A priori' methods of assessment should be provided (e.g., for effectiveness studies if the author(s) chose to include only randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled studies, or allocation concealment as inclusion criteria); for other types of studies alternative items will be relevant. Note: Can include use of a quality scoring tool or checklist, e.g., Jadad scale, risk of bias, sensitivity analysis, etc., or a description of quality items, with some kind of result for EACH study (“low” or “high” is fine, as long as it is clear which studies scored “low” and which scored “high”; a summary score/range for all studies is not acceptable).
A8. Was the scientific quality of the included studies used appropriately in formulating conclusions? The results of the methodological rigor and scientific quality should be considered in the analysis and the conclusions of the review, and explicitly stated in formulating recommendations. Note: Might say something such as “the results should be interpreted with caution due to poor quality of included studies.” Cannot score “yes” for this question if scored “no” for question A7.
A9. Were the methods used to combine the findings of studies appropriate? For the pooled results, a test should be done to ensure the studies were combinable, to assess their homogeneity (i.e., Chi-squared test for homogeneity, I2 ). If heterogeneity exists a random effects model should be used and/or the clinical appropriateness of combining should be taken into consideration (i.e., is it sensible to combine?). Note: Indicate “yes” if they mention or describe heterogeneity, i.e., if they explain that they cannot pool because of heterogeneity/variability between interventions.
A10. Was the likelihood of publication bias assessed? An assessment of publication bias should include a combination of graphical aids (e.g., funnel plot, other available tests) and/or statistical tests (e.g., Egger regression test, Hedges-Olken). Note: If no test values or funnel plot included, score “no”. Score “yes” if mentions that publication bias could not be assessed because there were fewer than 10 included studies.
A11. Was the conflict of interest included? Potential sources of support should be clearly acknowledged in both the systematic review and the included studies. Note: To get a “yes,” must indicate source of funding or support for the systematic review AND for each of the included studies..

# PRISMA 2009
P1. Identify the report as a systematic review, meta-analysis, or both.
P2. Provide a structured summary including, as applicable: background; objectives; data sources; study eligibility criteria, participants, and interventions; study appraisal and synthesis methods; results; limitations; conclusions and implications of key findings; systematic review registration number.
P3. Describe the rationale for the review in the context of what is already known.
P4. Provide an explicit statement of questions being addressed with reference to participants, interventions, comparisons, outcomes, and study design (PICOS).
P5. Indicate if a review protocol exists, if and where it can be accessed (e.g., Web address), and, if available, provide registration information including registration number.
P6. Specify study characteristics (e.g., PICOS, length of follow-up) and report characteristics (e.g., years considered, language, publication status) used as criteria for eligibility, giving rationale.
P7. Describe all information sources (e.g., databases with dates of coverage, contact with study authors to identify additional studies) in the search and date last searched.
P8. Present full electronic search strategy for at least one database, including any limits used, such that it could be repeated.
P9. State the process for selecting studies (i.e., screening, eligibility, included in systematic review, and, if applicable, included in the meta-analysis).
P10. Describe method of data extraction from reports (e.g., piloted forms, independently, in duplicate) and any processes for obtaining and confirming data from investigators.
P11. List and define all variables for which data were sought (e.g., PICOS, funding sources) and any assumptions and simplifications made.
P12. Describe methods used for assessing risk of bias of individual studies (including specification of whether this was done at the study or outcome level), and how this information is to be used in any data synthesis.
P13. State the principal summary measures (e.g., risk ratio, difference in means).
P14. Describe the methods of handling data and combining results of studies, if done, including measures of consistency (e.g., I2) for each meta-analysis.
P15. Specify any assessment of risk of bias that may affect the cumulative evidence (e.g., publication bias, selective reporting within studies).
P16. Describe methods of additional analyses (e.g., sensitivity or subgroup analyses, meta-regression), if done, indicating which were pre-specified.
P17. Give numbers of studies screened, assessed for eligibility, and included in the review, with reasons for exclusions at each stage, ideally with a flow diagram.
P18. For each study, present characteristics for which data were extracted (e.g., study size, PICOS, follow-up period) and provide the citations.
P19. Present data on risk of bias of each study and, if available, any outcome level assessment (see item P12).
P20. For all outcomes considered (benefits or harms), present, for each study: (a) simple summary data for each intervention group (b) effect estimates and confidence intervals, ideally with a forest plot.
P21. Present results of each meta-analysis done, including confidence intervals and measures of consistency.
P22. Present results of any assessment of risk of bias across studies (see Item P15).
P23. Give results of additional analyses, if done (e.g., sensitivity or subgroup analyses, meta-regression [see Item P16]).
P24. Summarize the main findings including the strength of evidence for each main outcome; consider their relevance to key groups (e.g., healthcare providers, users, and policy makers).
P25. Discuss limitations at study and outcome level (e.g., risk of bias), and at review-level (e.g., incomplete retrieval of identified research, reporting bias).
P26. Provide a general interpretation of the results in the context of other evidence, and implications for future research.
P27. Describe sources of funding for the systematic review and other support (e.g., supply of data); role of funders for the systematic review.
