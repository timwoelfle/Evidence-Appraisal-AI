- ""We performed a multicenter, open-label, randomized, controlled trial involving patients 18 to 75 years of age with resectable cancer of the middle or lower third of the esophagus."" [1]
- ""Specific inclusion criteria were the following: squamous-cell carcinoma or adenocarcinoma of thoracic esophagus with a clinical stage of I, II, or III (tumor stage 1 through 3 [T1, T2, or T3], no nodal involvement [N0] or presence of cancer in lymph nodes [N1] or in distant lymph nodes [≥5 cm from the tumor; N2], and no metastases [M0]) before the receipt of any induction treatment; esophageal cancer in the middle or lower third of the esophagus or junctional (Siewert’s type I) tumor; the receipt or nonreceipt of neoadjuvant radiotherapy, chemotherapy, or both; tumors that were considered to be resectable with a curative intention at the time of preoperative evaluation; an age of 18 to 75 years; a World Health Organization performance-status score of 0, 1, or 2 (on a 5-point scale, with higher numbers indicating greater disability); ability to provide written informed consent; ability to undergo one of the investigated surgical procedures; and ability to attend the follow-up visits."" [2]

The eligibility criteria for this trial appear to be relatively pragmatic. The trial includes patients with resectable cancer of the middle or lower third of the esophagus, which is a common population for esophageal cancer surgery. The inclusion criteria specify the tumor stage, performance status, and ability to undergo surgery, which are all relevant factors in determining eligibility for this intervention. The age range of 18 to 75 years is also reasonable. Overall, the eligibility criteria seem to be similar to those used in usual care, so the trial can be considered pragmatic. Score: [4]

Recruitment:
- ""The trial was conducted at 13 centers in France."" [2]

The full text does not provide specific information about the recruitment methods used in this trial. It only mentions that the trial was conducted at 13 centers in France. Without further details, it is difficult to assess the recruitment methods and determine if they were more or less pragmatic than usual care. Score: [NA]

Setting:
- ""The trial was conducted at 13 centers in France."" [2]

The trial was conducted at multiple centers in France, which suggests that the setting of the trial was more pragmatic than if it had been conducted at a single center or only specialized trial or academic centers. Conducting the trial at multiple centers increases the generalizability of the results to a broader population and reflects real-world practice. Score: [4]

Organisation:
- ""All the participating centers had surgeons who were experienced in esophageal-cancer surgery and in laparoscopic gastric mobilization, with at least 25 procedures performed at each center before it was included in the trial."" [2]

The full text mentions that all participating centers had surgeons who were experienced in esophageal-cancer surgery and laparoscopic gastric mobilization, with a minimum of 25 procedures performed at each center before inclusion in the trial. This suggests that the trial used existing resources and expertise available in usual care settings, making it more pragmatic. Score: [4]

Flexibility (delivery):
- ""Despite the difference in approach to the abdominal component of the surgical procedure, the surgical technique was standardized between groups and performed as described previously."" [2]

The full text states that the surgical technique was standardized between the hybrid-procedure group and the open-procedure group. This suggests that there was limited flexibility in how the intervention was delivered, with a strict protocol followed for both groups. This approach is more explanatory than pragmatic, as it does not allow for variations in the delivery of the intervention that may occur in usual care settings. Score: [2]

Flexibility (adherence):
- Not applicable. The full text does not mention any specific requirements for participant adherence to the intervention. Score: [NA]

Follow-up:
- ""Patients were followed up at 30 days after surgery and every 6 months for 3 years after surgery."" [2]

The follow-up schedule described in the full text includes regular visits at specific time points after surgery, which is similar to usual care. The follow-up period of 3 years is also reasonable for assessing long-term outcomes. Overall, the intensity of measurement and follow-up in this trial appears to be similar to what would be expected in usual care, making it pragmatic. Score: [4]

Primary outcome:
- ""The primary end point was major complication during surgery or within 30 days after surgery."" [2]

The primary outcome of major complications during or within 30 days after surgery is directly relevant to the participants and reflects an outcome of importance in usual care. This choice of primary outcome is pragmatic. Score: [5]

Primary analysis:
- ""All the analyses were performed on an intention-to-treat basis; the analyses included all the patients who had undergone randomization, regardless of the surgery performed and eligibility criteria."" [2]

The full text states that the primary analysis was performed on an intention-to-treat basis, including all patients who underwent randomization, regardless of the surgery performed and eligibility criteria. This approach is consistent with a pragmatic trial design, as it reflects the real-world scenario where patients may not always adhere to the assigned treatment or meet all eligibility criteria. Score: [5]

Based on the assessment of the PRECIS-2 domains, the trial described in the full text can be considered relatively pragmatic overall. The eligibility criteria, setting, organization, follow-up, primary outcome, and primary analysis all align with a pragmatic approach. However, the recruitment methods and flexibility in delivery of the intervention were not clearly described in the full text, making it difficult to assess those domains."

[1]
- ""The patients were randomized to one of the parallel groups: PRA or LTLA."" [1]

The eligibility criteria for this trial appear to be quite pragmatic. The inclusion criteria are clearly defined and specific, focusing on patients with planned unilateral adrenal surgery for a benign tumor up to 7 cm in diameter. The exclusion criteria are also well-defined and cover a range of factors that could affect the outcomes of the trial. The randomization process further supports the pragmatic nature of the trial design. Score: [4]

Recruitment:
- ""Eighty-eight patients were referred for adrenal surgery and were potential candidates for the study. Twenty patients did not meet the inclusion criteria and 3 refused to participate, leaving 65 patients with complete short-term follow-up (33 in the PRA and 32 in the LTLA group) and 61 patients who were followed-up for 5 years (30 in the PRA and 31 in the LTLA group) as shown in Fig. 1."" [1]

The recruitment process for this trial seems to be pragmatic. The study enrolled patients who were referred for adrenal surgery and met the inclusion criteria. The number of patients who did not meet the inclusion criteria or refused to participate is small, suggesting that the recruitment process was successful in identifying eligible participants. However, the full text does not provide information on any additional efforts made to recruit participants beyond those typically used in usual care. Score: [3]

Setting:
- ""Patients referred to the Third Department of General Surgery, Jagiellonian University Medical College, Krakow, between January 2006 and June 2008 for first time adrenal surgery were registered."" [1]

The setting of this trial appears to be somewhat explanatory. The trial was conducted at a single center, the Third Department of General Surgery at Jagiellonian University Medical College in Krakow. While this setting may be representative of usual care in that region, it may not be generalizable to other settings. Score: [2]

1. ""Consecutive patients admitted for suspected acute appendicitis, aged between 18 and 75 years, were recruited. We included patients with a history of right lower quadrant pain or periumbilical pain migrating to the right lower quadrant, presence of right lower quadrant guarding, tenderness upon physical examination, and fever of more than 38°C and/or white cell counts more than 10 × 103 cells per mL."" [1]
2. ""The exclusion criteria were as follows: diagnosis of appendicitis was not clinically established (symptoms attributable to urinary or gynecological problems), symptoms of more than 5 days, and/or a palpable mass in the right lower quadrant suggesting an appendiceal mass. Additional patients with the following conditions were also excluded: history of cirrhosis and coagulation disorders, generalized peritonitis, shock upon admission, previous abdominal surgery, ascites, suspected or proven malignancy, contraindication to general anesthesia (severe cardiac and/or pulmonary disease), inability to give informed consent, and pregnancy."" [1]

The eligibility criteria for this trial appear to be relatively pragmatic. Patients were included based on clinical signs and symptoms suggestive of acute appendicitis, which is consistent with usual care. The exclusion criteria also seem reasonable and are likely to reflect the typical exclusions seen in usual care. Overall, the trial seems to have a pragmatic approach to eligibility.

Score: [4]

Recruitment:
1. ""Between October 2009 and March 2011, consecutive patients admitted with clinical or radiological evidence of appendicitis were randomly assigned to receive either LESS or TPLA."" [1]
2. ""The patients were randomized after surgery was offered. They were randomly allocated to LESS appendectomy (group A) or TPLA (group B) by opening sealed envelopes containing a computer-generated code in blocks of 10."" [1]

The recruitment process for this trial appears to be pragmatic. Patients were recruited consecutively from those admitted with clinical or radiological evidence of appendicitis, which is consistent with usual care. The randomization process was also pragmatic, with patients being randomized after surgery was offered. This suggests that the trial made efforts to recruit participants in a way that is similar to usual care.

Score: [5]

Setting:
1. ""The study was performed between October 2009 and March 2011 in the Prince of Wales Hospital (University affiliated) and the North District Hospital. Together, the 2 hospitals provide government-supported services to the Eastern New Territories' region in Hong Kong, which is comprised of a population of approximately 1 million people."" [1]

The trial was conducted in two hospitals that provide government-supported services to a large population in Hong Kong. While the trial was conducted in specific hospitals, these hospitals are likely representative of the usual care setting for appendectomy in the region. Therefore, the trial setting appears to be pragmatic.

Score: [4]

Organisation:
1. ""All procedures were performed or supervised by specialist surgeons with experience of more than 20 LESS appendectomies. They were also proficient with advanced laparoscopic surgical techniques and had experience of more than 100 laparoscopic procedures in their respective subspecialties."" [1]
2. ""Four designated surgeons performed all the procedures in Prince of Wales Hospital, whereas the operations in North District Hospital were performed by 2 designated surgeons."" [1]

The trial utilized specialist surgeons with experience in LESS appendectomy and advanced laparoscopic techniques. While this may suggest a more specialized approach compared to usual care, the fact that the surgeons had experience in both LESS and conventional laparoscopic procedures suggests that the trial did not require more than usual expertise or certification. Additionally, the fact that the surgeons were designated to perform all the procedures in their respective hospitals suggests that the trial did not require additional staff levels or resources beyond what is available in usual care. Therefore, the trial appears to have a pragmatic approach to organization.

Conversion would be first to TPLA followed by open appendectomy if the 3-port technique was unable to adequately address the aforementioned problems."" [1]

The trial utilized a specific surgical technique for LESS appendectomy, with two 5-mm ports and one 10-mm port inserted through a transumbilical incision. While this suggests a specific protocol for the delivery of the intervention, the trial also allowed for flexibility in the form of conversion to TPLA or open appendectomy if needed. This suggests that the trial had a balance between a specific protocol and flexibility in delivery, which is consistent with usual care.

The follow-up process for this trial appears to be pragmatic. Patients were discharged based on usual care criteria and were followed up at 2 weeks, which is a reasonable timeframe for assessing postoperative outcomes. The trial did not involve more frequent or longer visits or unscheduled visits triggered by primary outcome events or intervening events. Therefore, the trial seems to have a pragmatic approach to follow-up.

This progresses to 10 and then 15 repetitions as performance improves. The exercise routine takes <15 min to complete, and participants are requested to complete the routine three times a day on 5 days of the week.""

The control group received usual care from the primary healthcare team, which suggests that the organization of care delivery in the control group was similar to usual care. The intervention group received training for the physiotherapists delivering the intervention, and the intervention itself involved a specific exercise routine that participants were asked to perform multiple times a day. This suggests that there may have been some additional resources and training required for the intervention arm compared to usual care.

The trial collected data on adherence through self-completed adherence diaries. The mean adherence rates were relatively high, with a mean total adherence of 46% and a mean partial or total adherence of 67%. This suggests that there was some flexibility in how participants were expected to adhere to the intervention, as they were not required to complete the exercises every day. However, it is unclear if there were any measures in place to improve adherence if participants were found to be non-compliant.

However, it is unclear if the sites were specialized trial or academic centers, so it is difficult to determine the extent of difference from usual care.

Organisation:
1. ""The types of implants used in the study reflected current practice."" [Score: 4] The study used implants that reflected current practice, suggesting that the organization of care delivery in the intervention arm was similar to usual care. However, it is unclear if any additional resources or training were provided to the intervention arm, so the score is not definitive.

Flexibility (delivery):
1. ""Our trial compared the TKR procedure versus the PKR procedure rather than a specific brand of TKR implant versus a specific brand of PKR implant. As such, surgeons were free to use the implant of their own choice, or that of their institution."" [Score: 5] The study allowed surgeons to use the implant of their choice, indicating a high level of flexibility in how the intervention was delivered, similar to usual care.

Flexibility (adherence):
1. ""Some non-compliance with allocation (ie, conversion from PKR to TKR from operative findings) was anticipated and clinically understandable but a complier-average causal effects analysis that we used to assess the potential effects of non-compliance on outcomes did not find any issue."" [Score: NA] The study mentioned that non-compliance with allocation was anticipated, but it did not provide specific details on how adherence to the intervention was monitored or managed. Therefore, it is not applicable to score this domain.

Follow-up:
1. ""Patients attended a clinic for an American Knee Society Score assessment and a complication review 2 months, 1 year, and 5 years after their operation. All other outcomes were collected with postal questionnaires at 2 months after the operation and 1 year after randomisation and, thereafter, annually (until 5 years after randomisation)."" [Score: 4] The study had follow-up assessments at multiple time points up to 5 years after randomization, which suggests a higher intensity of measurement and follow-up compared to usual care. However, the frequency and duration of follow-up visits were not explicitly mentioned, so it is difficult to determine the extent of difference from usual care.

Primary outcome:
1. ""The primary outcome measure was the OKS 5 years after randomisation in all patients assigned to groups."" [Score: 5] The primary outcome measure was directly relevant to the participants, as it assessed their knee function and pain after the surgery.

Primary analysis:
1. ""The statistical analysis was primarily on an intention-to-treat basis and used all available participant data."" [Score: 5] The study used an intention-to-treat analysis, which includes all available participant data, ensuring that all data were included in the analysis of the primary outcome."

1. ""After giving informed consent, 57 patients with movement disorders—mostly PD but also dystonia and tremor—underwent bilateral DBS implantation in the same operation in the globus pallidus internus (GPi), the subthalamic nucleus (STN), or the thalamic ventralis intermedius nucleus (Vim), according to the medical indication."" [1]
2. ""Considering that most of the subjects were PD patients receiving bilateral implants in the STN (34 patients), we compared the clinical effects of STN stimulation between the groups undergoing each of the techniques by using the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale Part III (UPDRS-III), Hoehn and Yahr Scale, and levodopa-equivalent dose before and 1 year after DBS."" [2]

The full text provides information on the eligibility criteria for the trial. It states that patients with movement disorders, mostly Parkinson's disease, were included in the study. The specific brain regions targeted for DBS implantation are also mentioned. However, there is no information provided on any exclusions or specific criteria used to select participants. Therefore, it is not possible to determine the extent to which the participants in the trial are similar to those who would receive this intervention in usual care. Score: [NA]

Recruitment:
1. ""After giving informed consent, 57 patients with movement disorders—mostly PD but also dystonia and tremor—underwent bilateral DBS implantation in the same operation in the globus pallidus internus (GPi), the subthalamic nucleus (STN), or the thalamic ventralis intermedius nucleus (Vim), according to the medical indication."" [1]

The full text does not provide any information on the recruitment process for the trial. It only mentions that patients with movement disorders who gave informed consent underwent the DBS implantation. There is no information on any extra effort made to recruit participants beyond those who would receive this intervention in usual care. Score: [NA]

Setting:
1. ""The procedures were performed within the period from June 2012 to December 2014."" [2]

It only mentions the time period during which the procedures were performed and that the study was approved by the local ethics committee. There is no information on the specific locations or types of centers where the trial took place. Score: [NA]

Organisation:
1. ""The simultaneous bilateral implant procedures were 38.5% faster than the conventional bilateral approach."" [2]
2. ""Overall, shorter procedures are more comfortable for the patient, who is therefore more likely to cooperate with the clinical examination, possibly improving the information provided to the surgical team during the process of decision making regarding electrode positioning."" [2]

The full text provides some information on the organization of care delivery in the intervention arm of the trial. It states that the simultaneous bilateral approach resulted in shorter procedures, which could be more comfortable for the patients. However, there is no information on any additional resources, provider expertise, or changes in care delivery organization beyond the standard procedure. Score: [3]

Flexibility (delivery):
