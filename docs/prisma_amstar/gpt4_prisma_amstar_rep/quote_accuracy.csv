Results: A total of 319 articles were identified in the initial search. Among the different techniques presented in 19 papers collected, we categorized reconstructive procedures into two groups: microsurgical and non-microsurgical techniques. Among the microsurgical techniques, procedures such as the osteocutaneous fibular flap (n Z 18), the myocutaneous latissimus dorsi flap (n Z 24), and the radial forearm free flap (n Z 293) were reported. Among the non-microsurgical techniques, we found a wider range of technical options (6 in total). Most were based on groin, abdominal, and scrotal flaps.

Methods A literature search was performed using the PubMed database, Embase, and the Cochrane central register of controlled trials using a defined set of criteria. The outcomes, which include post-operative mortality, incidence of hernia recurrence, rates of patch use and complications, were analyzed. Results We investigated nine studies, which included 507 patients. All studies were non-randomized historical control trials. The MIS group had a significantly lower rate of post-operative death with a risk ratio of 0.26 [95 % confidence interval (CI) 0.10–0.68; p = 0.006] but a greater incidence of hernia recurrence with a risk ratio of 3.42 (95 % CI 1.98–5.88; p \ 0.00001).

The aim of this study was to identify clinical evidence about the reliability of this technique in the recent literature. Methods: We performed a Medline search for articles published during the last 10 years, using the key words “varicocele,” “treatment,” and “adolescent.” As limits, we used last 10 years, adolescent, clinical trials, randomized controlled trials, meta-analysis, and multicenter retrospective and prospective studies. The results were investigated in recurrence and hydrocele formation. Results: We pooled 37 studies, but 26 of these were excluded because they were neither relevant nor concerned an adolescent population. Meta-analysis showed that there was no statistical difference between laparoscopic surgery and open surgery in recurrence rate and postoperative hydrocele rate. In the laparoscopic group, the incidence of recurrence was higher in the patients undergoing artery ligation compared to patients undergoing artery and venous ligation. Furthermore, a lower rate of postoperative hydrocele was recorded in patients undergoing dye injections before laparoscopic ligation. Conclusions: Meta-analysis and literature analysis showed that the results after laparoscopic varicocelectomy are comparable to other surgical procedures. The laparoscopic approach has the advantage to treat simultaneously bilateral varicocele.",fulltext,"Abstract Purpose: Laparoscopic varicocelectomy has gained popularity in recent years.
