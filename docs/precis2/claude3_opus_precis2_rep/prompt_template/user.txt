For each of the 9 domains of PRECIS-2, perform the following steps:
1. Extract 1-3 relevant quotes from the full text.
2. Explain your reasoning in 1 paragraph.
3. Give a score X from 1 (very explanatory) to 5 (very pragmatic) in square brackets like this: "Score: [X]". If the full text does not contain enough information to assess a specific domain, report "Score: [NA]".

Do not provide a final summary paragraph in the end.
