PRECIS is a tool to help trialists make
design decisions consistent with the
intended purpose of their trial. This
paper gives guidance on how to use an
improved, validated version, PRECIS-2,
which has been developed with the
help of over 80 international trialists,
clinicians, and policymakers. Keeping
the original simple wheel format,
PRECIS-2 has nine domains—eligibility
criteria, recruitment, setting,
organisation, flexibility (delivery),
flexibility (adherence), follow-up,
primary outcome, and primary
analysis—scored from 1 (very
explanatory) to 5 (very pragmatic) to
facilitate domain discussion and
consensus. It is hoped PRECIS-2 will be
valuable in supporting the explicit
matching of design decisions to how
the trial results are intended to be used
Randomised trials are hard work. Like much that is
hard, this toil is only worth it because of the prospect of
a substantial reward. For many important stakeholders
(patients or others who may benefit from an interven-
tion, funders of healthcare and of research, practi-
tioners who may deliver clinical care and often the
researchers themselves) the anticipated reward for a
trial is that the results can be used to directly support
decisions on delivering an intervention that will
improve health outcomes for patients and the public.
Key to this reward is that the trial can indeed support
end user decisions in the ways intended by the trial
design team. That this is not always, or even mostly, the
case was highlighted nearly 50 years ago, by Schwartz
and Lellouch in their paper on pragmatic and explana-
tory attitudes to randomised controlled trials.
1
Simply put, these authors describe two purposes for
randomised trials. A pragmatic randomised trial is
undertaken in the “real world” and with usual care and
is intended to help support a decision on whether to
deliver an intervention. An explanatory randomised
trial is undertaken in an idealised setting, to give the
initiative under evaluation its best chance to demon-
strate a beneficial effect. 
2-4 
These two approaches repre-
sent different attitudes to decision making on the
usefulness of interventions. Moreover, although we will
refer to trials as having an explanatory or a pragmatic
intention throughout this paper, we recognise that
there is no simple threshold and that there are few
purely explanatory or pragmatic trials; rather than
dichotomy there is a continuum.
There is widespread concern that explanatory ran-
domised trials can be poor predictors of the real world
effectiveness of the interventions they test.
4-7 
Schwartz
and Lellouch suggested that trialists often wish to inform
a real world decision, but, almost by default, tend to
design trials that are more explanatory than they should
be given the designers’ intention. The original PRECIS
(PRagmatic Explanatory Continuum Indicator Summary)
tool was developed in 2005–08 by 25 international trial-
ists and methodologists
8 
to help trialists work through
their design decisions so that they might avoid designing
a trial that did not match their own intentions for the
trial. There is demand for such tools; PRECIS has been
cited over 300 times since 2009, it is one of eight “useful
papers” for trialists listed on the UK National Institute for
Health Research Randomised Trials Methods website
(www.nets.nihr.ac.uk/resources/trials-coordination),
and many investigators have used PRECIS prospectively
and retrospectively to consider trial design. 
9 
While
acknowledging the usefulness of PRECIS, these latter
authors have identified weaknesses, including unclear
face validity and inter-rater reliability, the lack of a scor-
ing system, redundancy in some PRECIS domains, and
the need for more guidance on how to use the tool.
This paper describes a new version of PRECIS, PRE-
CIS-2, which aims to address these (and other) weak-
nesses while keeping the strengths of the original tool,
especially its simple format. The paper also provides
guidance on how to use the tool. As with the original
2009 PRECIS tool, we intend PRECIS-2 to be used at the
design stage of a trial in order to help trialists make the
purpose of their trial explicit and to ensure that their
design choices are concordant with their intended
Summary pointS
PRECIS (2009) was a tool with 10 domains to design clinical trials on a continuum of
explanatory attitude (ideal situation) to more pragmatic attitude (usual care)
Cited over 300 times by end of 2014, but weaknesses have been highlighted: no rating
scale, problems with some domains, needing better guidance, and not validated
This paper presents PRECIS-2—a validated, improved version of the tool—together
with guidance for how to use it
PRECIS-2 has nine domains including three new ones (recruitment, setting, and
organisation), each scored on a 5-point Likert continuum (from 1=very explanatory
“ideal conditions” to 5=very pragmatic “usual care conditions”) so that trialists,
clinicians, and policymakers can more easily consider whether design decisions
match their intended purpose

This work is part of a larger project concerned with
ensuring that trials are designed so that their results are
relevant to, and used by, patients, clinicians, and policy
decision makers.
9 
This paper presents the PRECIS-2 tool
and gives guidance on how to use it but does not pres-
ent in full the work that led to it, which will be pub-
lished separately (see Loudon et al
9 
or contact the
authors for more information).
Briefly, we ran a two-round Delphi communication
with contact authors who had cited PRECIS but who
had neither been involved in the original development
of PRECIS nor evaluated the utility of PRECIS. We dis-
cussed how to improve PRECIS, focusing on issues
raised by PRECIS users
 
9 
and brainstorming with trial-
ists in Dundee. The Delphi results were the basis for a
brainstorming meeting in Toronto involving some of
the original developers of PRECIS plus some of those
who had undertaken methodological work using PRE-
CIS, together with clinicians and policymakers. We
then user-tested candidate PRECIS-2 models, with 19
international trialists, on a one-to-one basis (in person
or via Skype). PRECIS-2 was modified in response to
user testing.
The version of PRECIS-2 that finally emerged was
used in validity and reliability testing by 19 raters.
These 19 raters had responded to an invitation we sent
to 33 individuals, identified from four sources: the
Delphi, user testing, the Toronto brainstorming meet-
ing, and through our personal networks of experienced
trialists. From these groups, 19 accepted the invitation
(six from the Delphi, two from user testing, three from
the Toronto meeting, and eight from our networks). The
raters were asked to score a varied sample of 15 trial pro-
tocols. These protocols were purposefully selected to
range from highly pragmatic to highly explanatory,
including both drug and non-drug trials. This testing
gave support for the proposed version of PRECIS 2,
which is the version discussed in this paper.
Focus of prECiS-2
The PRECIS-2 tool focuses on trial design choices which
determine the applicability of a trial. Applicability (the
ability for a trial result to be applied or used in a partic-
ular situation) is the outcome of these choices, which
affect the ease with which the trial results can be
applied to and by the usual community of users of the
intervention in the settings in which the trial designers
envisioned it being used. This may, of course, vary for
different readers, and thus applicability has both
“local” and more distant meanings. The aim of a highly
pragmatic trial would be to maximise applicability of
the intervention to usual care across a range of local
and distant settings. The aim of a highly explanatory
trial would be to maximise the intervention’s chance of
demonstrating an effect through the expected mecha-
nism, with little attention paid to the issue of whether
this outcome would be achieved under real world con-
ditions, neither locally nor in more distant settings.
Applicability is a continuum, and various trial design
choices can make a trial more, or less, applicable; in
other words more or less pragmatic.
In general, pragmatic trials are focused on care in the
most common settings and are less commonly focused
on highly specialised care settings. However, we believe
that, even in specialised settings, a trial can be more or
less applicable depending on the degree to which it pro-
vides care with resources and clinicians standard in
that setting, to patients who are typical of that setting.
Note that pragmatism constitutes only a close matching
between the care delivered in the setting in which the
trial was conducted and the care delivered in the setting
to which its results are applied. This close matching
provides directly applicable information and thus helps
decision makers choose whether to implement the
intervention tested in the trial.
How to use prECiS-2
The tool has been developed to be used by a multidisci-
plinary team throughout the process of designing their
trial. This team will usually include expertise in the par-
ticular intervention and health service setting in which
the intervention will be used, should it be shown to be
effective, as well as statistical expertise.
There are four steps to using PRECIS-2, which may be
iterative if there remains a gap between the intended
purpose of the trial and the initial design choices,
which will be revealed as the developing design is
viewed through the prism of the PRECIS-2 tool.
Step 1: What design approach are you taking?
The first step is to be clear about your intention or atti-
tude to the trial you are designing. Are you
What is new in PRECIS-2 compared with PRECIS
• A scale for all domains which can be scored from 1 (very explanatory) to 5 (very
pragmatic)
• Eligibility criteria has been placed on the 12 o’clock spoke
• Clockwise use of PRECIS-2 with logical ordering of adjacent domains
• The participant eligibility criterion (which might formerly have been thought of as
including issues of setting and issues of multicentre trials) has been separated into
“Eligibility” and “Setting”
• New domains of “Recruitment” and “Organization”,
• Domain name changes:
– 
From “Practitioner adherence” to “Flexibility: delivery”
– 
From “Participant compliance” to “Flexibility: adherence”
– From “Follow up intensity” to “Follow up”
– From “Outcome” to “Primary outcome”
• Removal of the comparison intervention domains of “Practitioner expertise” and
“Flexibility of the comparison intervention”
• Domain name labels on the PRECIS-2 wheel now come with short explanations
• Improved guidance on how to use PRECIS-2

• Aiming to take an explanatory approach to answer
the question, “Can this intervention work under ideal
conditions?”
• Aiming to take a pragmatic approach to answer the
question, “Does this intervention work under usual
conditions?”
Both approaches to trial design have their place, but
trialists should be clear which they would prefer to
emphasise for the trial they are designing. As men-
tioned previously, trialists have often emphasised the
first approach by default rather than as a deliberate
decision.
1
Step 2: Consider your trial design choices for each
of the PRECIS-2 domains
This step is explained in more detail for each domain
later on. Imagining first the most pragmatic and the
most explanatory design choice you could make for
each domain may help you in deciding how you wish to
implement that domain choice, and thus how prag-
matic or explanatory you want your actual decision on
that domain to be.
Before discussing the domains further, we should
clarify what is meant by “participant.” Participants
include patients or other individual recipients of an
intervention, or providers of the intervention, or both.
This may include individual participants or one or
more levels of clusters. For example, in a trial of a con-
tinuing education intervention, participants may be
health professionals and trained instructors, and the
trial may be randomised into clusters at the level of the
instructor. In some cluster trials, if randomisation
occurs at two levels (such as organisation and individ-
ual participants), scoring of the domains may need to
be considered separately.
Step 3: Score 1 to 5 for the choices made in Step 2
and mark on the PRECIS-2 wheel
If there is uncertainty over how explanatory or prag-
matic your proposed trial design element is for a partic-
ular domain, then we suggest the score for this domain
should be left blank; this will highlight the uncertainty
and encourage discussion. Domains which have greater
scoring variation by raters probably require further dis-
cussion and reiteration of steps 1 to 4 to clarify the
design of this domain so there is greater agreement.
Having considered your design choices in Step 2,
position your choice for each domain on the PRECIS-2
wheel to record how pragmatic or explanatory these
choices are for each domain. Scoring each domain can
be done using a 5-point Likert scale:
1. Very explanatory
2. Rather explanatory
3. Equally pragmatic and explanatory
4. Rather pragmatic
5. Very pragmatic.
A toolkit with guidance and practical help is available
to download from www.precis-2.org. The appendix on
this website provides four examples of comparative
effectiveness trials with explanations of our scoring
decisions for the PRECIS-2 domains: a cluster ran-
domised trial in rural India to improve maternal and
newborn health,
10 
a pharmacological primary care trial
in UK to control asthma, 
11 
an international music ther-
apy trial to treat preschool children with autism, 
12 
and
an international surgical trial for coronary angiogra-
phy.
13 
None of these trials, as far as we are aware, was
designed using the PRECIS tool, and they do not refer to
the Schwartz and Lellouch paper, 
1 
so this is a post facto
assessment, but nevertheless gives the reader some
idea of how each domain may vary from pragmatic to
explanatory.
Step 4: Review the PRECIS-2 wheel
Review your set of nine domain design choices (Step 2)
on the PRECIS-2 wheel (figure) to see whether they will
produce a trial that will support the overall aim you
identified for your trial in Step 1. Go back to Step 2 and
modify your design choices if required.
the nine domains of prECiS-2
PRECIS-2 has nine domains, each of which is intended
to help trialists think about the consequences of that
design decision for applicability of the results of their
trial. The PRECIS-2 tool is focused exclusively on the
issue of applicability, and readers should use other
tools to assess the internal validity or any other aspect
of their design choices.
Each domain encourages trialists to think about their
trial and the recipients in the usual care situation in
which their results might be applied if the intervention
proves beneficial. If trialists are aiming for high applica-
bility (that is, a pragmatic approach to design decisions),

then we would expect the match between trial and
usual care to be very good. If trialists are aiming to give
the intervention its best shot at showing a benefit (that
is, an explanatory approach), then the match between
trial and usual care may not be close. The point of PRE-
CIS-2 is not to always to produce a predominantly prag-
matic design (close match between trial and usual care)
but to make trialists think about the aim of their trial
and decide whether the design is appropriate given the
aim of their trial.
In pragmatic trials the comparator is usual care. In
explanatory trials it may not be. In PRECIS-2 the
domains are based on the assumption that the trial is
two armed, one of which is usual care with no changes.
If usual care is not the comparator, or there are multiple
intervention arms that are very different from each
other, then the arms will need to be scored separately;
there may be differences in Organisation and Flexibility
(delivery) and Flexibility (adherence).
The nine PRECIS-2 domains are:
1. 
Eligibility—To what extent are the participants in the
trial similar to those who would receive this interven-
tion if it was part of usual care?
2.
 Recruitment—How much extra effort is made to
recruit participants over and above what would be
used in the usual care setting to engage with patients?
3. 
Setting—How different are the settings of the trial
from the usual care setting?
4. Organisation—How different are the resources, pro-
vider expertise, and the organisation of care delivery
in the intervention arm of the trial from those avail-
able in usual care?
5.
 Flexibility (delivery)—How different is the flexibility
in how the intervention is delivered and the flexibility
anticipated in usual care?
6. 
Flexibility (adherence)—How different is the flexibil-
ity in how participants are monitored and encour-
aged to adhere to the intervention from the flexibility
anticipated in usual care?
7. Follow-up—How different is the intensity of measure-
ment and follow-up of participants in the trial from
the typical follow-up in usual care?
8. Primary outcome—To what extent is the trial’s pri-
mary outcome directly relevant to participants?
9.
 Primary analysis—To what extent are all data
included in the analysis of the primary outcome?
the domains in detail
1. Eligibility criteria—Who is selected to participate
in the trial?
A highly pragmatic approach to eligibility criteria
would be to include in the trial anyone with the condi-
tion of interest who is likely to be a candidate for the
intervention if it was being provided in usual care for
this condition. So, if in usual care the intervention
would likely be used for children, elderly people, peo-
ple with a range of comorbidities, and people with a
probable diagnosis rather than, say, a laboratory con-
firmed diagnosis, then all of these groups should be in
the trial too. If people aged over 80 or with multiple
morbidities would not receive the intervention in usual
care because we already know that this intervention
does more harm than good in elderly or multi-morbid
patients, then a pragmatic design choice would be to
exclude them from the trial. A trial with eligibility
design choices like this would score at or close to 5 on
the PRECIS-2 scale.
As the level of similarity between the people in the
trial and those in usual care decreases, then so would
the PRECIS-2 score. Many things could reduce the score,
but some examples include
• Excluding people not known or shown to be highly
adherent to the intervention.
• Excluding people using tests or measures that are not
used or available in usual care.
• Excluding people not expected to be highly respon-
sive to the intervention.
• Excluding people who would be likely to receive the
intervention in usual care but inclusion in the trial is
considered too difficult because of challenges unre-
lated to the delivery of the intervention. Children,
people over the age of 65, and pregnant women are
good examples of people commonly excluded
because of anticipated difficulties of gaining ethical
approval rather than whether they would be likely to
receive an intervention in usual care.
• Excluding people whose adherence and follow-up
may pose difficulties, whether because of social dis-
advantage, personal circumstances, or illness (such
as homelessness, substance misuse, mental health
problems, or poor motivation).
• Excluding people dependent on help for activities of
daily living, unless they would usually not be eligible
for intervention.
Trialists may make their trials less like usual care by
having tight inclusion criteria and broad exclusion
Eligibility criteria, example 1: Early treatment with
prednisolone or acyclovir in Bell’s palsy*
• Inclusion criteria—Patients with confirmed diagnosis:
≥16 years of age with unilateral facial nerve weakness
of no identifiable cause who presented to primary
care or an emergency department and could be
referred to a collaborating otorhinolaryngologist <72
hours after the onset of symptoms.
• Exclusion criteria—Pregnancy, breast feeding,
uncontrolled diabetes, peptic ulcer disease,
suppurative otitis media, herpes zoster, multiple
sclerosis, systematic infection, sarcoidosis and other
rare conditions, and an inability to provide informed
consent.
• Extra test—Randomised controlled trial of Bell’s palsy
treatment required senior otorhinolaryngologist in
hospitals to confirm a patient’s eligibility to
participate. Bell’s palsy is usually diagnosed by a
general practitioner in primary care.
• Suggested PRECIS score—2, rather explanatory.

criteria. For trialists taking an explanatory approach
this is often appropriate, but this is unlikely to be the
case for trialists aiming to design a trial that is directly
applicable in a particular usual care setting, let alone
one intended to have wide generalisability across mul-
tiple care settings. Under certain circumstances, a trial
design may be pragmatic (and the results highly appli-
cable to the usual care of the participants under study)
even with narrow eligibility criteria if the particular
narrow criteria are similar to those routinely used for
those participants in their usual care setting. Some
rare disease trials may fall into this category. Trials in
myotonic dystrophy type 1, for example, may require a
genetic confirmation of the diagnosis, but since most
patients with myotonic dystrophy type 1 receive their
diagnosis through genetic confirmation this inclusion
criterion simply reflects what is usual practice. Finally,
exclusion criteria for known safety issues would not
generally reduce the PRECIS-2 score since such indi-
viduals would not be expected to get the intervention
in usual care.
2. Recruitment—How are participants recruited into
the trial?
This domain has been included to encourage trialists to
consider how and where they will recruit people to their
trial. (For clarity, we have described only trials involv-
ing patients, but, as stated above, participants could be
groups of practitioners or health system where the goal
is to improve some aspect of care at the intervention
unit of clinics, wards, hospitals, or geographic area.)
The most extreme pragmatic approach to recruitment
would be to do this in usual care so that only the people
who attend a clinic with the condition of interest are
recruited after they present on their own behalf without
any overt recruitment effort. A highly pragmatic
approach to trial design would also recruit from more
than one clinic as an explicit way of increasing applica-
bility of the trial results. Recruiting through usual
appointments at a diverse range of clinics is likely to
score at or close to 5 on the PRECIS-2 scale.
If the above is not feasible, at least as the sole recruit-
ment route, trialists will need to add other recruitment
strategies. If extra resources will be required to recruit
people to the trial, trialists need to consider if this
affects applicability, especially if participants are
recruited from settings other than the one in which the
results are likely to be applied. For example, recruiting
in secondary care for an intervention that will mainly
be used in primary care will ensure that the recruited
patients are different in severity and treatment than the
patients with this same condition in primary care; and
so this will make the trial more explanatory and reduce
the PRECIS 2 score. Additional recruitment approaches
that could potentially reduce the PRECIS-2 score
include
• Searching medical record systems for eligible partic-
ipants and then mailing invitation letters. Depending
on local resources, such as electronic medical records
and comprehensive local disease registers, this
approach may be easily achievable in usual care and
so would not reduce the PRECIS-2 score.
• Media advertising campaigns such as television
and radio advertisements, newspaper advertise-
ments, flyers, websites, press releases, letters to the
editor, interviews with the chief investigator on
television or radio. The issue to consider here is
whether these campaigns are being used simply to
speed up recruitment, or because they are the only
way to reach a dispersed population. In the latter
case, if such campaigns would not be available in
usual care then this trial recruitment route is more
explanatory.
• Incentives such as cash payment, vouchers, travel
costs, or childcare. Some of these incentives may be
better considered as part of the intervention (for
example, a lifestyle change intervention aimed at
new mothers may only be effective because childcare
was also provided and women could therefore attend
sessions).
Eligibility criteria, example 2: Practical approach to
lung health in South Africa*
• Inclusion criteria—All patients aged ≥15 with
suspected asthma were included in the study, based
on a crude clinical diagnosis of asthma, as the
standard respiratory testing machinery was not
available in this rural setting in South Africa.
• Suggested PRECIS score—5, very pragmatic.
*Fairall LR, Zwarenstein M, Bateman ED, et al. Effect of
educational outreach to nurses on tuberculosis case
detection and primary care of respiratory illness: pragmatic
cluster randomised controlled trial. BMJ 2005;331:750-4.
Recruitment, example: Leukotriene antagonists for
asthma treatment*
• Initially extra resources were used to recruit patients
at 53 primary care practices. Patients were recruited
via a postal questionnaire to identify symptoms and
trial eligibility, not just to invite to participate. This
would push the recruitment path of this domain
towards the explanatory end. By using this method of
recruitment, which requires administration not
normally present in primary care, it is possible that
responders may be healthier than those at the clinic
being invited to the trial and also more highly
motivated and compliant as they have come through
a different route than those invited during a clinic
attendance.
• In this trial, recruitment was inadequate using a
postal questionnaire, so participants were then
recruited through clinic attendances changing the
recruitment towards a more pragmatic trial design,
creating results which are more applicable to users of
the results in a primary care setting.
• Suggested PRECIS score—2, rather explanatory; but,
as trial continued, a PRECIS score of 3 (equally
pragmatic and explanatory) since trial now more a
mix of recruitment methods, some of which are
feasible in usual care.

3. Setting—Where is the trial being done?
This domain has been included to encourage trialists to
explicitly consider the match between the setting of
their trial and the setting where their results are likely to
be applied. While there are no accepted guidelines for
how to assess the impact of setting on applicability, 
5
there are several characteristics of the setting that will
almost always need to be considered, including geogra-
phy, healthcare system, country, and the socioeco-
nomic and ethnic mix of the population. 
4 14 15 
All of
these might affect the applicability of results from a
particular trial.
The most extremely pragmatic approach to setting
would be to do the trial in an identical setting to which
you intend the results to be applied. Such a trial is likely
to score at or close to 5 on PRECIS-2.
Even settings that seem rather restrictive could still
be a highly pragmatic design choice if this setting is the
usual care setting where patients are treated for the par-
ticular health condition. For example, if a trial was car-
ried out in the most specialist intensive care units in the
country and the intention of the trial was to support
decision making in these highly specialised units, then
the design choice with regard to setting is still prag-
matic. Conversely, if the trial results were intended to be
useful for all intensive care units, but the trial included
only highly specialised units, then the trial is now tak-
ing a more explanatory approach to the choice of set-
ting that goes against the intention of the trial.
Determining how pragmatic or explanatory a setting
is can be problematic when there is a proposed change
in the setting for care delivery. For instance, if a trial is
carried out in secondary care and the intention is that,
if the change in setting is successful, all future care will
be delivered in this setting, then this new setting will be
become the usual care setting. In this case the setting
domain in the trial would be explanatory compared
with current usual care, but trialists can note that the
difference is an explicit feature of the intervention.
Approaches to setting that are likely to reduce the
PRECIS-2 score include
• Selecting participating centres from among only spe-
cialist or academic centres when the trial is intended
to be applicable to all types of practice or clinic treat-
ing the condition of interest.
• Running the trial in a single centre. It is rare that a
trial is done with the intention that its results should
apply to only that single centre. Including several
centres makes it easier to claim that the trial setting
matches that to which the results will be applied.
Trialists working on trials that cross jurisdictions (such
as international trials) need to use their judgment with
regard to the impact these different settings have on the
overall trial applicability. If the trial is delivered in the
same setting as usual care in each jurisdiction then the
trial is likely to score as pragmatic on PRECIS-2, even if
the settings are different in each jurisdiction. In this
case, the trial randomisation would be stratified by
jurisdiction.
4. Organisation—What expertise and resources are
needed to deliver the intervention?
This domain has been included to encourage trialists to
consider the match between how care is organised and
delivered in the trial and how the intervention would be
made available to patients in usual care. As there have
been acknowledged difficulties in implementing results
post-trial (even in settings where the trial was con-
ducted
16
), we wanted trialists to consider organising the
delivery of their trial intervention with an awareness of
how easy it would be to implement the intervention
post-trial .
A highly pragmatic design would aim to slot the inter-
vention into the usual organisation of care for the condi-
tion of interest, making use of no more than the existing
healthcare staff and resources in that setting. A design
like this is likely to score at or close to 5 on PRECIS-2.
Sometimes a change to how care is organised is itself
the intervention being evaluated (see, for example,
Zwarenstein et al’s trial of directly observed treatment
(DOTS) versus self-supervised treatment for tuberculo-
sis 
17 
), and the difference between the trial and usual
care is clear. In this case the organisation domain would
be explanatory compared with current usual care, but
trialists can note that the difference is an explicit fea-
ture of the intervention.
The PRECIS-2 organisation score will be reduced to
the degree trialists make changes in how care is deliv-
ered compared with the usual recipients and care deliv-
ery. For example, the trial team may, in the intervention
arm, provide additional training to staff or provide
additional staff so that the intervention can be deliv-
ered. Patients who would normally be seen in primary

• Multi-centre: 25 practices in UK.
• Suggested PRECIS score—5, very pragmatic

• Single centre and specialised centre (Madigan Army

country they live in.

care may be seen by specialists in secondary care
instead, or they may receive additional expensive diag-
nostic procedures unavailable in usual care. The suc-
cess or otherwise of the trial then depends on resources
unavailable in usual care, reducing applicability. If
these additional resources are essential to the effective-
ness of the intervention they should be considered to be
part of the intervention and be specified in the part of
the protocol describing the intervention. In that case
these resources should not be counted when this ele-
ment of the trial is judged.
Organisational approaches that are likely to reduce
the PRECIS-2 score include the following (but only
when they are not incorporated and described as neces-
sary elements of the intervention):
• Increasing the number of healthcare or other profes-
sionals available to deliver the intervention over and
above the levels available in usual care.
• Providing significant levels of additional training to
increase the expertise of healthcare professionals.
• Requiring healthcare professionals to have some
minimum level of experience, defined by length of
time, in working with the intervention that is greater
than would be the case in usual care.
• Requiring healthcare professionals to have a spe-
cialty certification that would not be considered
essential to deliver the intervention in usual care.
• Increasing the resources (such as facilities, diag-
nostic equipment, consumables) available to
deliver the intervention, measure outcomes, or do
follow-up over and above what would be available
in usual care.
5. Flexibility (delivery)—How should the intervention
be delivered?
In PRECIS-2, trialists wishing to conduct more pragmatic
trials are encouraged to think about how the interven-
tion will be implemented post-trial in the setting where
the results are expected to be applied. The most prag-
matic design approach to delivery flexibility would leave
the details of how to implement the intervention up to
providers, in other words, what happens in usual care.
Thus, the methodology of how to deliver an intervention
is not rigidly prescriptive in the protocol. For example,
the details of how to perform a surgical procedure could
be left entirely to the surgeon, or how to deliver an edu-
cational programme is left to the discretion of the educa-
tor. Additionally, a pragmatic approach would not
dictate which other interventions were permitted, or
how to deliver them, which again is the situation in
usual practice. This sort of delivery flexibility would
score at or close to 5 on PRECIS-2. Flexibility (delivery)
applies to all intervention arms and the comparator
(control) arm if usual care is not the comparator, and if
necessary each of these arms will need to be scored sep-
arately. If usual care is the intended comparator but any
elements relating to delivery are changed it ceases to be
usual care and needs to be scored.
As delivery flexibility is reduced, the trial moves
towards a more explanatory approach in this domain.
Approaches to delivery flexibility that are likely to
reduce the PRECIS-2 score include
• A highly specified, protocol driven intervention. For
example, specific direction is given for how to the
administer the intervention (such as dose, dosing
schedule, surgical procedures, educational material,
and delivery)
• Having measures in place to monitor the compliance
of those delivering the intervention (such as doctors)
Organisation, example 1: Establishment of Acute
Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) Network in
1994*
• Multicentre clinical trials of ARDS treatments, but
there was difficulty translating results from a trial
involving low tidal volume (Vt) into usual clinical
practice
• Ten academic centres with 75 intensive care units
• Extra staff, and very labour intensive
• Used additional equipment beyond usual care, none
of which was planned for at the trial design stage
• Suggested PRECIS score—1, very explanatory

Organisation, example 2: Early lens extraction and
intraocular lens implantation to treat glaucoma*
• Identical organisation to usual care, usual clinic
• Same number of staff
• Usual experience—fully qualified ophthalmologists
who have completed general and specialist training
(in ophthalmology and glaucoma, respectively) and
able to perform lens extraction procedures
• No additional training
• No additional resources
• Suggested PRECIS score—5, very pragmatic

Flexibility (delivery), example 1: Cognitive
behavioural therapy (CBT) for depression*
• Measures in place to monitor and improve
compliance: In this trial therapy was delivered by
selected experts who received regular training and
supervision (but were independently assessed as
representative of NHS staff). There was also
independent assessment to confirm minimum
standard of delivery of CBT but no measures in place
to improve compliance as this was self regulated by
therapists.
• No specific protocol for timing or co-interventions
• Suggested PRECIS score—5, very pragmatic

with the protocol and measures (up to and including
exclusion) to address poor compliance.
• The timing of intervention delivery is tightly defined
and designed to maximise the intervention effect.
• Providers undertake additional interventions that
would not occur in usual care
• Restrictions are placed on the number and types of
co-interventions, particularly if excluded co-inter-
ventions would dilute any intervention effect
• There is specific direction for applying permitted
co-interventions
• There are specific directions for managing complica-
tions or side effects of the intervention.
6. Flexibility (adherence)—What measures are in
place to ensure participants adhere to the
intervention?
It is important that trialists focused on applicability con-
sider how probable it is that there will be uptake of the
intervention being tested and how recipients will engage
with it in the setting in which it will be later applied.
A highly pragmatic design approach would allow for full
flexibility in how end user recipients engage with the
intervention. In usual care, health professionals encour-
age patients to take medication or follow therapy as best
they can, and such encouragement would not count
against a pragmatic design; if it also happens in usual
care, allowing it in the trial is a pragmatic design deci-
sion. A trial with no special measures to enforce engage-
ment or compliance would score at or close to 5 on
PRECIS-2. On the other hand, a trial protocol that lays
out methods to monitor and ensure patient compliance
would score at or close to 1 on PRECIS-2. Flexibility
(adherence) applies to all intervention arms and the
comparator (control) arm if usual care if not the compar-
ator, and if necessary each of these arms will need to be
scored separately. If usual care is the intended compar-
ator but any elements relating to adherence are changed
it ceases to be usual care and needs to be scored.
It is possible that improving recipients’ ability to take
medication or follow therapy is the intervention under
evaluation, a situation similar to that already described for
the Setting and Organisation domains. In this case, the
Flexibility (adherence) domain would be explanatory
compared with current usual care, but trialists can note
that the difference is an explicit feature of the intervention.
As flexibility for recipients is reduced, the trial moves
towards a more explanatory approach on this domain.
Approaches to recipient flexibility that are likely to
reduce the PRECIS-2 score include
• Having a trial pre-screening stage where patients are
evaluated for adherence with the intervention (such
as dose, dosing schedule, attendance at therapy ses-
sions). Patients judged to not be adherent are
excluded.
• Withdrawing patients from the trial if their adherence
with the intervention drops below some specified
level. For example, a trial might withdraw patients if
they failed to attend two consecutive sessions of cog-
nitive behavioural therapy or failed to take more than
90% of their medication.
• Having measures in place to monitor patient adher-
ence with the protocol and measures (up to and
including withdrawal) to address poor adherence.
Measures to increase patient adherence should this
fall below some specified level could, for example,
include scheduling an extra discussion with a
research nurse about why following the trial instruc-
tions is important.
In some trials—such as surgical trials where patients
are being operated on or intensive care unit trials where
patients are being given intravenous drugs—this
domain is not applicable as there is no adherence issue
after consent has been given, so we suggest that the
PRECIS-2 score should be left blank.
7. Follow-up—How closely are participants
followed up?
This domain encourages trialists to think about fol-
low-up with regard to the setting where the results will be
applied. The most pragmatic position with regard to fol-
low-up would be to have no more follow-up of recipients
than would be the case in usual care. Indeed, the most
extreme position is to have no follow-up contact at all
with recipients and to obtain outcome data by other
means (such as electronic medical records or other usual
data to measure mortality or hospital admissions). Trials
that have no more follow-up than is normal in usual care
and have minimal additional data collection (or use data
obtained from administrative or clinical record systems
without direct contact with the participant) would be
likely to score at or close to 5 on PRECIS-2.
Flexibility (delivery), example 2: Elective caesarean
section syntocinon infusion trial*
• Protocol driven—Much detail given, with protocol
violations recorded in self reported case form.
Investigators accept this may occur due to clinical
needs (such as anaesthesia).
• Co-interventions—Specific direction
• Complications—Specific directions for managing
complications or side effects
• Improving adherence—No measures in place
• Suggested PRECIS score—2, rather explanatory

Flexibility (adherence), example: Music therapy to
support communication in autistic children*

As follow-up becomes more intense, the trial
becomes more explanatory and the PRECIS-2 score will
decrease. Follow-up approaches that are likely to
reduce the PRECIS-2 score include
• Follow-up visits that are more frequent than would
typically occur under usual care.
• Unscheduled follow-up visits are triggered by a pri-
mary outcome event.
• Unscheduled follow-up visits are triggered by an
intervening event that is likely to lead to the primary
outcome event.
• Patients are contacted if they fail to keep trial
appointments. This would not reduce the PRECIS-2
score if this was also done in usual care.
• More extensive data are collected, particularly interven-
tion related data, than would be typical outside the trial.
• Visits are longer than usual care and involve addi-
tional or different staff.
Often the required trial outcomes may be obtained only
through contact with the recipients. Even in the “no fol-
low-up” approach, assessment of outcomes may be
achieved with a single follow-up at the end of the study.
The end of study would need to be defined so that there
is sufficient time for the desired study outcomes (see
Primary outcome domain below) to be observed. When
the follow-up is done in this way, it is unlikely to have
an impact on engagement or response to the treatment,
and so such a follow-up approach would be viewed as
pragmatic and rated at or close to 5.
It is often the case that explanatory trials are inter-
ested in the effect of an intervention only during a brief
intervention period or shortly after. On the other hand,
trials taking a pragmatic approach to design may follow
recipients well beyond the intervention period. This
longer period of follow-up may require more contacts
than would be the case in usual care, but this need not
be inconsistent with a pragmatic approach if it does not
result in care management that differs from the usual
conditions. It is, however, important to consider the
burden of follow-up for participants.
8. Primary outcome—How relevant is it to
participants?
The choice of primary outcome is a crucial trial design
decision, and a pragmatic approach would be to select an
outcome that is of obvious importance from the patient’s
perspective. Post-trial, an outcome selected using a prag-
matic approach would also be relevant to commissioners
of care, the people who decide whether to implement the
intervention on the basis of its results. For example, an
intervention that aims to reduce falls in elderly people
living independently in the community should have as its
primary outcome the number of falls in the elderly living
independently in the community. This outcome has
meaning to patients, their relatives and friends, health-
care professionals, and policymakers. Measures of, say,
bone density, muscle strength, or functional ability are
distant from the key question of whether the intervention
prevents elderly people falling in their own homes. Trials
that choose outcomes of obvious importance to patients,
and measure them in a way that is the same or similar to
the way they are measured in usual care would be likely
to score at or close to 5 on PRECIS-2.
As the primary outcome becomes less recognisably
important to patients, or is assessed on criteria seldom
used in usual care, the trial becomes more explanatory
and the PRECIS-2 score will decrease. Approaches to the
primary outcomes that are likely to reduce the PRECIS-2
score include
• Choosing a surrogate outcome (such as blood test)
that the intervention is expected to have a direct
Follow-up, example 2: Self management course for
chronic musculoskeletal pain*
• Participants followed up two times over a year (at 6
and 12 months)—not intense. This is quite close to
usual care for pain related disability.
• Follow-up for the primary outcome requires self
completion of a postal validated questionnaire
chronic pain grade, which contains three questions
to determine the primary outcome “pain related
disability” (and secondary outcome “pain
intensity”).
• No additional follow up visits—All additional data
collection for secondary outcomes use six additional
short postal questionnaires sent at 6 and 12 months:
EQ-5D (health utility), Pain Self-Efficacy
Questionnaire, Hospital Anxiety and Depression
Scale (mood), Chronic Pain Acceptance
Questionnaire (coping), Health Education Impact
Questionnaire (social integration subscale), Census
global health question (general health).
• Additional data from GP electronic records
• Suggested PRECIS score—4, rather pragmatic

Follow-up, example 1: Perioperative β blockade for
patients undergoing infrarenal vascular surgery*
• Clinical follow-up until patient left hospital
(discharge or death) or until 30 days after surgery,
whichever was the longer, so more than usual care.
• Monitoring intensity involved more extensive data
collection than usual:
Pre-operation—three-lead electrocardiogram (ECG)
Holter monitor (Flashcard with 2×48 hour
recording) set up on each patient and maintained
for 72 hours.
Troponin values at 1, 3, and 7 days after surgery
(more usual for only 1 and 3 days after surgery)
ECG after randomisation and at 7 and 30 days after
surgery.
• Unscheduled follow-up visits triggered by primary
outcome: a cardiovascular event (such as angina,
myocardial infarction, stroke)
• Suggested PRECIS score—1, very explanatory

effect on, or the use of safety climate surveys rather
than medical error events or near miss events.
• Using a composite primary outcome in which some of
the elements are less important to patients or partici-
pants than others (such as incidence of death, stroke,
myocardial infarction, or renal dysfunction at 30 days).
• Having central adjudication of the outcome or using
an assessment that needs special training or tests not
normally used in usual care.
• Choosing an outcome that is important but mainly to
providers, typically because it is a physiological out-
come considered useful in treatment planning and
monitoring.
• Measuring an outcome that is important but at a time
that is earlier than would be normal in usual care. For
example, stroke could be a primary outcome in trials
making explanatory or pragmatic design choices.
However, time horizons may vary from short term
after a one-time intervention (more explanatory) to
long term (more pragmatic).
9. Primary analysis—To what extent are all data
included?
Most trials are a superiority design so the most prag-
matic approach with regard to the analysis would be to
make no special allowance in the analysis for non-ad-
herence, practice variability, etc. In other words, the
pragmatic approach to the analysis would typically be
an intention-to-treat analysis using all available data.
This sort of analysis would score at or close to 5 on PRE-
CIS-2. (Non-inferiority and equivalence trials are usu-
ally contrary to intention-to-treat analysis.)
The intention-to-treat analysis has recently also
become the norm for superiority trials taking a more
explanatory design approach, especially when regula-
tory approval for an intervention is being sought. The
most explanatory approach would be to use the “as
treated analysis” as the primary analysis, in which only
those patients who actually received (or did not receive)
the intervention would be analysed in the intervention
and control groups respectively, irrespective of their ini-
tial randomised group allocation.
Other causes of missing data may be important but may
not affect how pragmatic or explanatory a trial is. System-
atic exclusion of data from participants because, say, they
were poorly adherent would make a trial more explana-
tory. Using all data but doing nothing to try and fill gaps
caused by missing data would not in itself make trial
more pragmatic or explanatory; missing data, especially
if there is a lot of it, makes any conclusions more uncer-
tain regardless of the design approach taken. As Vickers
and Altman state, “analysis of missing data teaches us
the importance of avoiding missing data in the first place:
an informed guess, even using a technique as sophisti-
cated as multiple imputation, is still a guess.”
18
Approaches to the primary analysis that are likely to
reduce the PRECIS-2 score include
• Excluding non-compliant recipients (per protocol
analysis)
• Analyse recipients to treatment received instead of
treatment randomised (as treated analysis)
• Excluding data from non-adherent providers
• Excluding data from trial sites or providers who
recruit below expected volume.
For some trials taking an explanatory approach (dose
finding trials are an example), it may be appropriate to
have primary analysis restricted in the ways mentioned;
otherwise such restricted analyses of the primary out-
come could be pre-planned as secondary analyses of
the primary outcome.
Conclusion
PRECIS-2 has been developed through extensive interna-
tional consultation with trialists, and we believe it will
help trialists (new and experienced) ensure that they

match their design decisions to the needs of those they
intend to use the results of the trial. It makes trial teams
explicitly aware of the range of opinions within the team
and facilitates discussion and eventual consensus. The
tool aims to assist in obtaining consistency in decision
making, meaning decisions made on each domain of
PRECIS-2 should broadly be in keeping with each other. It
does not remove the need for judgment because there is
no single “correct” answer to be discovered. The advan-
tage of PRECIS-2 is that it makes these judgments explicit
and therefore able to be discussed by the trial team.
PRECIS-2 could be a tool in a multifaceted package to
help trialists design trials that meet the users’ needs.
For instance, in the US, the NIH Clinical and Transla-
tional Science Awards (CTSA) Consortium does not con-
duct trials but facilitates their conduct and
implementation, and PRECIS-2 could used as part of
those activities.
19 
Trials units and other centres of trial
expertise could work through the PRECIS-2 wheel with
investigators to ensure that trial design decisions are
consistent with the investigators’ intended purpose.
The tool could also be a way of promoting trials that effi-
ciently assist in the continued development of evidence
based care.
 
20 
It would thus continue to promote and
re-energise Archie Cochrane’s vision of efficient effec-
tive healthcare by addressing the issue of applicability
and extrapolating trial results into real life.
21
There is a substantial degree of waste in medical
research (see http://researchwaste.net). Some of this
waste is due to trials providing results that are irrele-
vant to the healthcare decisions of those for whom the
trial was intended to help.
 
4-6 
We believe PRECIS-2 can
help to reduce this waste by raising awareness of the
need to explicitly consider the match between design
decisions (and the consequences of these) and the use-
fulness of the future results to the intended audience.
As Dave Sackett has pointed out, the applicability of the
results of a trial can never be assured,
22 
because of the
complexity of patients, health professionals, clinical
settings, cultures, and healthcare systems. But using
PRECIS-2 to consider applicability at the design stage
will make it more likely that the results of a trial are
more useful to their intended users than they otherwise
would have been.
As in the original PRECIS tool, the authors welcome
feedback on PRECIS-2 to continue the quest to design
trials fit for purpose.

How to use PRECIS-2 - Designing trials that are fit for purpose
We think there are four steps to using PRECIS-2, which may be iterative depending on what you
discover after going through the steps.
Step 1: Why are you doing your trial?
Your first step is to be clear about why you are doing your trial. Are you:
1. Aiming to take an explanatory approach to answer the question ‘Can this
intervention work under ideal conditions?’
2. Aiming to take a pragmatic approach and answer the question ‘Does this
intervention work under usual conditions?’
Both approaches to trial design have their place but trialists should be clear which path they are on.
As Schwartz and Lellouch pointed out, trialists have often taken the first approach by default rather
than as a considered judgement.
Step 2: Consider your trial design choices for each of the nine PRECIS-2 domains
This step is explained in more detail for each domain later on.
Step 3: Score 1 to 5 for these choices made in Step 2 and/or mark on the PRECIS-2 wheel
Having considered your design choices in Step 2, the PRECIS-2 wheel is used to record how
pragmatic or explanatory these choices are for each domain. Each domain is a 5-point Likert scale:
1. Very explanatory
2. Rather explanatory
3. Equally pragmatic/explanatory
4. Rather pragmatic
5. Very pragmatic
A table can be used in conjunction with the PRECIS “wheel” or instead of the wheel to give rationale
for scores. You can use this to assist discussion with trial collaborators.
Step 4: Review your PRECIS-2 wheel
Review your design choices (Step 2) on the PRECIS-2 wheel to see whether they will produce a trial
that will support the aim identified in Step 1. Go back to Step 2 and modify your design choices if
required.

The PRECIS-2 Domains
The NINE PRECIS-2 domains are:
 Eligibility –to what extent are the participants in the trial similar to those who would receive this
intervention if it was part of usual care? For example, score 5 for very pragmatic criteria
essentially identical to those in usual care; score 1 for a very explanatory approach with lots of
exclusions (e.g. those who don’t comply, respond to treatment, or are not at high risk for
primary outcome, are children or elderly), or uses many selection tests not used in usual care.
 Recruitment - how much extra effort is made to recruit participants over and above what that
would be used in the usual care setting to engage with patients? For example, score 5 for very
pragmatic recruitment through usual appointments or clinic; score 1 for a very explanatory
approach with targeted invitation letters, advertising in newspapers, radio plus incentives and
other routes that would not be used in usual care.
 Setting – how different is the setting of the trial and the usual care setting? For example, score 5
for a very pragmatic choice using identical settings to usual care; score 1, for a very explanatory
approach with only a single centre, or only specialised trial or academic centres.
 Organisation – how different are the resources, provider expertise and the organisation of care
delivery in the intervention arm of the trial and those available in usual care? For example, score
5 for a very pragmatic choice that uses identical organisation to usual care; score 1 for a very
explanatory approach if the trial increases staff levels, gives additional training, require more
than usual experience or certification and increase resources.
 Flexibility (delivery) – how different is the flexibility in how the intervention is delivered and the
flexibility likely in usual care? For example, score 5 for a very pragmatic choice with identical
flexibility to usual care; score 1 for a very explanatory approach if there is a strict protocol,
monitoring and measures to improve compliance, with specific advice on allowed co-
interventions and complications.
 Flexibility (adherence) - how different is the flexibility in how participants must adhere to the
intervention and the flexibility likely in usual care? For example, score 5 for a very pragmatic
choice involving no more than usual encouragement to adhere to the intervention; score 1 for a
very explanatory approach that involves exclusion based on adherence, and measures to
improve adherence if found wanting. In some trials eg surgical trials where patients are being
operated on or Intensive Care Unit trials where patients are being given IV drug therapy, this
domain is not applicable as there is no compliance issue after consent has been given, so this
score should be left blank.
 Follow-up - how different is the intensity of measurement and follow-up of participants in the
trial and the likely follow-up in usual care? For example, score 5 for a very pragmatic approach
with no more than usual follow up; score 1 for a very explanatory approach with more frequent,
longer visits, unscheduled visits triggered by primary outcome event or intervening event, and
more extensive data collection.
 Primary outcome – to what extent is the trial's primary outcome relevant to participants? For
example, score 5 for a very pragmatic choice where the outcome is of obvious importance to
participants; score 1 for a very explanatory approach using a surrogate, physiological outcome,
central adjudication or use assessment expertise that is not available in usual care, or the
outcome is measured at an earlier time than in usual care.
 Primary analysis – to what extent are all data included in the analysis of the primary outcome?
For example, score 5 for a very pragmatic approach using intention to treat with all available
data; score 1 for a very explanatory analysis that excludes ineligible post-randomisation
participants, includes only completers or those following the treatment protocol.

5/8
Notes
“Participants" include patients or other individual recipients of an intervention, and/or providers of
the intervention. This may include individual participants and/or one or more levels of clusters. For
example, in a trial of a continuing education intervention, participants may be health professionals
and trained instructors and the trial may be randomised into clusters at the level of the instructor.
During the design process, if there is uncertainty over how explanatory or pragmatic a domain is,
then we suggest the score for this domain should be left blank. This will then highlight uncertainty
and encourage discussion. If PRECIS-2 is used to look at how pragmatic included trials are in
systematic reviews then a score of 3 may be chosen if there is inadequate information. This is
different to the “3 = equally pragmatic/explanatory”.

Table – PRECIS-2 scores for trial domains
Domain Score Rationale
1 Eligibility Criteria 5 
Patients ≥ 3 with acute respiratory tract infections. Exclusions not common cold but severe respiratory tract infections,
peptic ulcer and asthma. But even asthma patients who were not sensitive to ibuprofen or aspirin eligible. Pregnant or
breast feeding women are discouraged from taking ibuprofen when pregnant but can take as low a dose as possible of
Paracetemol but as both being tested in the trial cannot include this group as participants. If include visually impaired
increase organisation of trial (as in carers have to assist diary completion) but that would be norm and usual if
prescribed ibuprofen or Paracetemol or steam treatment in usual care, so just easier for trialists to exclude. Small
proportion of participants – so why exclude? Depressed and people with psychosis unreliable diary fillers, concerned
with other things.
2 Recruitment Path 5 
Patients presenting to GP or nurse in primary care with respiratory tract infections as diagnosed by health professional.
Easy to recruit to but time pressures in busy winter clinics prevented recruitment and meant non-recruitments logs
poorly completed.
3 Setting 5 Identical setting to usual care setting - primary care where patients usually go for advice and treatment.
4 
Organisation
intervention
3 
Information sheets given out to participants. This is not usual practice, would it be if trial had shown this helped? Need
more staff for follow up of trial participants to get diary results so more extensive data collection than usual. Otherwise
no difference in provider expertise and organisation of care delivery.

Compliance measured with diary – “reasonably good” participants free to “not-comply” with advice. Little impact of
advising patients to take analgesics regularly. No measures to improve compliance
7 Follow up 2 Participants Followed up one month – usual care no follow up. Patients come back to GP if problems.
Trial more extensive data colleaction - patients telephoned day two to three to check for any problems with diary
completion. If no diary after 2 weeks then mailed reminder and then phoned as necessary to document outcomes using
validated questionnaire.
8 Outcome 5 
Very relevant to participants - Mean symptom severity on days 2-4. Symptoms 0 (no problem) to 6 (as bad as they can
be 7 in abstract). Completed in diary at end of day – children with parents or participants.
9 Analysis 5 ITT no matter whether compliance.
