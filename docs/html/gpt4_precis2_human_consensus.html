<pre>
1. Eligibility criteria

Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Pregnant women were eligible if they were to undergo their first or second caesarean section through a planned transverse abdominal incision.&quot;</span>
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Women were not eligible if there was a clear indication for a particular surgical technique or material to be used that prevented any of the allocated interventions being used, if they had more than one previous caesarean section, or if they had already been recruited into the trial.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The eligibility criteria for this trial were quite broad, including any pregnant woman undergoing her first or second caesarean section. However, there were some exclusions, such as women who had more than one previous caesarean section or if there was a clear indication for a particular surgical technique. This suggests a somewhat pragmatic approach, as the trial aimed to include a wide range of typical patients but did exclude some specific groups.

Score: [4]

2. Recruitment

Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Each participating site, advised by their research ethics committee, decided how to provide trial information to women and seek informed consent.&quot;</span>
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;If the woman agreed to participate, she signed a formal consent form or used the method of recording consent permitted in that setting (eg, a thumb print).&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The recruitment process was not clearly described in the text, but it seems that it was left up to each participating site to decide how to provide trial information and seek informed consent. This suggests a somewhat pragmatic approach, as it allows for flexibility and adaptation to the local context.

Score: [4]

3. Setting

Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Between May 20, 2007, and Dec 31, 2010, 15 935 women were recruited at 19 sites in Argentina, Chile, Ghana, India, Kenya, Pakistan, and Sudan.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial was conducted in a variety of settings across multiple countries, suggesting a pragmatic approach. This diversity of settings increases the generalizability of the trial results to different healthcare systems and populations.

Score: [5]

4. Organisation

Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Each regional coordinator (one per country, except India, which was split into two regions) started and documented a training programme that ensured that surgeons operating within the trial were familiar with the techniques being compared before participating.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial required some level of organization and coordination, with regional coordinators responsible for training surgeons in the techniques being compared. However, the text does not provide detailed information about the resources or expertise required to deliver the intervention, making it difficult to assess this domain.

Score: [NA]

5. Flexibility (delivery)

Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;All non-allocated surgical elements and all other aspects of the caesarean section procedure were undertaken at the discretion of the surgeon.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial allowed for a high degree of flexibility in the delivery of the intervention, with surgeons able to use their discretion for all non-allocated surgical elements and other aspects of the procedure. This suggests a very pragmatic approach, as it closely mirrors the variability and individual decision-making that occurs in usual care.

Score: [5]

6. Flexibility (adherence)

Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Compliance with all the allocated interventions was high, 87% overall.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial reported high compliance with the allocated interventions, suggesting that there were measures in place to ensure adherence. However, the text does not provide detailed information about these measures, making it difficult to assess this domain.

Score: [NA]

7. Follow-up

Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Data were collected at trial entry, immediately after surgery, at hospital discharge (including hospital transfer or death), and at about 6 weeks after delivery.&quot;</span>
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Women who did not return at 6 weeks were located and interviewed by telephone or during a home visit.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial had a structured follow-up process, with data collected at specific time points and efforts made to locate and interview women who did not return for their 6-week follow-up. This suggests a somewhat explanatory approach, as it involves more intensive follow-up than might occur in usual care.

Score: [3]

8. Primary outcome

Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The primary outcome was the composite of death, maternal infectious morbidity, further operative procedures, or blood transfusion (>1 unit) up to the 6-week follow-up visit.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The primary outcome of the trial was a composite measure of several outcomes that are clearly relevant to patients, including death, infectious morbidity, further operative procedures, and blood transfusion. This suggests a pragmatic approach, as it focuses on outcomes that are meaningful to patients and likely to be measured in usual care.

Score: [5]

9. Primary analysis

Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;For the analysis of maternal outcomes, women were analysed in the groups into which they were allocated; for example, comparing women allocated to blunt abdominal entry with those allocated to sharp abdominal entry, regardless of what interventions they actually received.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial used an intention-to-treat analysis, which includes all participants in the groups to which they were originally allocated, regardless of what interventions they actually received. This is a pragmatic approach, as it reflects the reality of clinical practice where not all patients receive or adhere to their allocated treatment.

<p><i><span style="border-bottom: 1px dashed black;">7 quote(s) from
publication full text</span> (mean similarity 100%)</i></p>
<pre>
1. Eligibility criteria

Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Patients with type 2 diabetes (n=264) selected by a self-administered questionnaire aimed at measuring emotional distress and diabetes-related reduced daily functioning.&quot;</span>
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Patients with score DFT >4 and DS >3 were eligible for trial participation.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial included patients with type 2 diabetes who were experiencing emotional distress and reduced daily functioning due to their condition. This suggests a somewhat pragmatic approach as it includes a broad range of patients who are likely to be seen in usual care. However, the use of specific measures (DFT and DS scores) to determine eligibility may not be commonly used in usual care, which leans towards an explanatory approach.

Score: [3]

2. Recruitment

Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Patients with type 2 diabetes (n=264) selected by a self-administered questionnaire aimed at measuring emotional distress and diabetes-related reduced daily functioning.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The recruitment process involved the use of a self-administered questionnaire, which is not a typical method used in usual care. This suggests a more explanatory approach to recruitment.

Score: [2]

3. Setting

Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;A regional care group in the Netherlands consisting of 77 family practices.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial was conducted in a real-world setting of family practices, which is representative of the usual care setting where the intervention would be applied. This suggests a pragmatic approach to the setting.

Score: [5]

4. Organisation

Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Practice nurses in the intervention arm (n=19) were trained to integrate SMS into their routine consultations.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial involved training practice nurses to integrate the intervention into their routine consultations. This suggests a somewhat pragmatic approach as it uses existing healthcare staff. However, the need for additional training leans towards an explanatory approach.

Score: [3]

5. Flexibility (delivery)

Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Practice nurses in the intervention arm (n=19) were trained to integrate SMS into their routine consultations.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The intervention was delivered by practice nurses during routine consultations, suggesting a pragmatic approach. However, the need for specific training to deliver the intervention leans towards an explanatory approach.

Score: [3]

6. Flexibility (adherence)

Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Patients with score DFT >4 and DS >3 were eligible for trial participation.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial required patients to adhere to specific criteria (DFT and DS scores) to be eligible for participation. This suggests a more explanatory approach as it imposes specific requirements on participants.

Score: [2]

7. Follow-up

Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Outcomes were measured at baseline and at 4-month and 12-month follow-ups.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial involved follow-up measurements at specific time points, which may not be typical in usual care. This suggests a more explanatory approach to follow-up.

Score: [2]

8. Primary outcome

Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The primary outcome measure was a dichotomised score on a Visual Analogue Scale that measured the perceived effect of diabetes on daily functioning.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The primary outcome was patient-reported and directly relevant to the patients' daily lives, suggesting a pragmatic approach. However, the use of a specific measurement scale leans towards an explanatory approach.

Score: [3]

9. Primary analysis

Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Multilevel analyses showed no significant differences in outcomes between the intervention and control arms.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial used a complex statistical analysis method, which is not typically used in usual care. This suggests a more explanatory approach to the primary analysis.

<p><i><span style="border-bottom: 1px dashed black;">9 quote(s) from
publication full text</span> (mean similarity 100%)</i></p>
<pre>
1. Eligibility criteria
- Quote: <span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 99.6%):

Eligible primary care patients 12 to 80 years of age had impaired asthmarelated quality of life (Mini Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire [MiniAQLQ] score ≤6) or inadequate asthma control (Asthma Control Questionnaire [ACQ] score ≥1).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;Eligible primary care patients 12 to 80 years of age had impaired asthma-related quality of life (Mini Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire [MiniAQLQ] score ≤6) or inadequate asthma control (Asthma Control Questionnaire [ACQ] score ≥1).&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The trial includes a broad age range of patients with asthma, which is representative of the general population of patients with this condition. The eligibility criteria are based on the severity of the disease, which is a pragmatic approach as it reflects the usual care setting where patients with more severe symptoms are more likely to receive the intervention.
- Score: [5]

- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The two trials, which were conducted at 53 primary care practices in the United Kingdom, enrolled patients 12 to 80 years of age with a physician’s diagnosis of asthma.&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The trial recruited patients from primary care practices, which is a pragmatic approach as it reflects the usual care setting where patients with asthma are typically identified and treated. However, the text does not provide detailed information about the recruitment process.
- Score: [NA]

3. Setting
- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The two trials, which were conducted at 53 primary care practices in the United Kingdom&quot;</span> [...] ""
- Reasoning: The trial was conducted in primary care practices, which is a pragmatic approach as it reflects the usual care setting where patients with asthma are typically treated. The trial was conducted in multiple centers, which increases the generalizability of the results.
- Score: [5]

4. Organisation
- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Practice staffs were asked to provide each patient with a written individualized asthma-action plan. For each of the assigned treatments, choices of individual drugs and devices were made according to normal clinical practice and British asthma guidelines.&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The trial used existing healthcare staff and resources, and the intervention was delivered according to normal clinical practice and guidelines, which is a pragmatic approach.
- Score: [5]

5. Flexibility (delivery)
- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;If a patient required a disallowed asthma medication, this fact was noted, and the patient remained in the study.&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The trial allowed for some flexibility in the delivery of the intervention, as patients who required a disallowed medication were not excluded from the trial. This is a pragmatic approach as it reflects the variability in treatment that occurs in usual care.
- Score: [4]

6. Flexibility (adherence)
- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;We determined adherence on the basis of prescriptions issued versus prescribing instructions for patients with at least 6 months without a change in therapy.&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The trial measured adherence based on prescriptions issued versus prescribing instructions, which is a pragmatic approach as it reflects the usual care setting where adherence is typically assessed.
- Score: [4]

7. Follow-up
- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;After the screening visit (week –2) and baseline visit (week 0), study assessments by telephone or in the clinic were scheduled at months 2, 6, 12, 18, and 24.&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The trial had scheduled follow-up assessments at regular intervals over a 2-year period, which is a pragmatic approach as it reflects the usual care setting where patients with chronic conditions like asthma are typically followed up over a long period.
- Score: [5]

8. Primary outcome

publication full text</span> (mean similarity 99.9%)</i></p>
<pre>
1. Eligibility criteria

Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Patient selection criteria were having a diagnosis of moderate-to-severe COPD (a Body mass index, Airflow obstruction, dyspnoea and Exercise capacity [BODE] index score of 3–7) according to international guidelines and having been clinically stable for the previous 4 weeks.&quot;</span>
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;All patients gave written informed consent.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial includes patients with moderate-to-severe COPD who have been clinically stable for the previous 4 weeks. This suggests a somewhat pragmatic approach as it includes a broad range of patients with the condition of interest. However, the requirement for clinical stability may exclude some patients who would otherwise receive the intervention in usual care, making the eligibility criteria slightly more explanatory.

Score: [4]

2. Recruitment

Quotes:
- <span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 99.3%):

This was a multicentre open-label pragmatic parallel-group randomized clinical trial involving 13 hospitals and was conducted between 2014 and 2017' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;This was a multicentre open-label pragmatic parallel-group randomized clinical trial involving 13 hospitals and was conducted between 2014 and 2017.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial recruited patients from 13 different hospitals, which suggests a pragmatic approach as it likely includes a diverse range of patients. However, the full text does not provide specific details about the recruitment process, such as whether patients were recruited through usual appointments or other methods.

Score: [NA]

3. Setting

Quotes:
- <span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 99.3%):

This was a multicentre open-label pragmatic parallel-group randomized clinical trial involving 13 hospitals and was conducted between 2014 and 2017' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;This was a multicentre open-label pragmatic parallel-group randomized clinical trial involving 13 hospitals and was conducted between 2014 and 2017.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial was conducted in 13 different hospitals, which suggests a pragmatic approach as it likely reflects the variety of settings in which the intervention would be applied in usual care. However, the full text does not provide specific details about the characteristics of these settings, such as their geography, healthcare system, or patient population.

Score: [NA]

4. Organisation

Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Patients in the IG were asked to continue at home with a similar training schedule to that completed in the hospital. They were provided with, for the 12-month follow-up period, a telerehabilitation kit (mobile phone, pulse oximeter, dumbbells and exercise bicycle) along with a user guide with detailed instructions on the use of the mobile device to deliver data collected to the web-based platform after completion of each scheduled session.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial required patients in the intervention group to continue their training at home using a telerehabilitation kit and to send their data to a web-based platform. This suggests a somewhat explanatory approach as it involves resources and expertise that may not be available in usual care. However, the intervention is designed to be implemented in the patients' homes, which is a pragmatic aspect.

Score: [3]

5. Flexibility (delivery)

Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Patients in the IG were asked to continue at home with a similar training schedule to that completed in the hospital. They were provided with, for the 12-month follow-up period, a telerehabilitation kit (mobile phone, pulse oximeter, dumbbells and exercise bicycle) along with a user guide with detailed instructions on the use of the mobile device to deliver data collected to the web-based platform after completion of each scheduled session.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial protocol specifies a training schedule for patients in the intervention group and provides them with a telerehabilitation kit and instructions for its use. This suggests a somewhat explanatory approach as it involves a specific protocol for delivering the intervention. However, the intervention is designed to be implemented in the patients' homes, which is a pragmatic aspect.

Score: [3]

6. Flexibility (adherence)

Quotes:
- <span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 99.5%):

patient in the IG arm was classified as a non-complier if he/she did not perform scheduled exercises for at least 8 consecutive weeks, unless there were clear clinical reasons not to.' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;A patient in the IG arm was classified as a non-complier if he/she did not perform scheduled exercises for at least 8 consecutive weeks, unless there were clear clinical reasons not to.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial protocol includes measures to monitor and ensure patient adherence to the intervention, such as classifying patients as non-compliers if they do not perform scheduled exercises for at least 8 consecutive weeks. This suggests an explanatory approach as it involves specific measures to enforce adherence that may not be used in usual care.

Score: [2]

7. Follow-up

Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;After the randomization visit, follow-up appointments were arranged for both groups at 3, 9 and 12 months.&quot;</span>
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;At each follow-up visit, the general health status of the patient was assessed, medical treatment was revised and optimized, educational reinforcement was provided, 6-minute walk test (6MWT) and spirometry tests were carried out and HRQoL measures were taken.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial includes follow-up appointments at 3, 9, and 12 months, during which various assessments are carried out. This suggests a somewhat explanatory approach as it involves more intensive follow-up than might occur in usual care. However, the follow-up appointments also include elements of usual care, such as revising and optimizing medical treatment.

Score: [3]

8. Primary outcome

Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The objective of this study was, therefore, to determine whether a maintenance TelePR carried out after an intensive initial PR programme was superior to usual care in sustaining, over time, the benefits achieved by the intensive PR.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The primary outcome of the trial is the sustainability of the benefits achieved by the intensive PR programme, which is a patient-relevant outcome. This suggests a pragmatic approach as it involves an outcome that is likely to be important to patients in usual care.

Score: [5]

9. Primary analysis

Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The main efficacy analysis used analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) techniques to test for differences between groups in outcome variables at the 12-month visit, adjusted for baseline values.&quot;</span>
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;All patients were analyzed in the group to which they were randomized.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial uses an intention-to-treat analysis, which includes all randomized patients in the analysis regardless of their adherence to the intervention. This suggests a pragmatic approach as it reflects the variability in adherence that would be expected in usual care.

<pre>
1. Eligibility criteria

Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The inclusion criteria were as follows: (1) diagnosed with MS in accordance with the McDonald criteria; (2) registered at the MS outpatient clinic; (3) living in 1 of 6 selected municipalities; (4) aged 18 years or older; (5) capable of providing signed written informed consent; and (6) EDSS score between 1 and 6.5 (1 = minor disability, 6.5 = able to walk 20 m with or without a walking aid).&quot;</span>
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The exclusion criteria were as follows: (1) pregnancy at time of examination; (2) exacerbation in the previous 2 weeks before enrollment; and (3) other acute conditions compromising balance.&quot;</span>

Reasoning:
The eligibility criteria for this trial are quite specific, including only those diagnosed with MS, registered at a specific clinic, living in certain municipalities, and within a certain age and disability range. This suggests that the trial is more explanatory in nature, as it does not include all individuals who might receive the intervention in a usual care setting. 

Score: [2]

2. Recruitment

Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;In August 2015, 1 of the MS nurses at the Department of Neurology, Nordland Hospital Trust in Bodø, Norway, sent out invitation letters with a consent form to 160 persons with MS who were registered at the MS outpatient clinic, had EDSS scores of 0 to 7, and lived in 1 of the 6 municipalities included in the study.&quot;</span>

Reasoning:
The recruitment process involved sending out invitation letters to potential participants who were already registered at the MS outpatient clinic. This suggests a more explanatory approach, as it involves an active recruitment effort rather than simply including those who present for usual care.

Score: [2]

3. Setting

Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The GroupCoreDIST intervention was conducted by 6 physical therapists in 6 municipalities in Norway. Standard care included the usual care for individuals with MS in the same municipalities.&quot;</span>

Reasoning:
The trial was conducted in multiple municipalities in Norway, which suggests a more pragmatic approach as it includes a variety of settings where the intervention might be applied in usual care. 

Score: [4]

4. Organisation

Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Six neurological physical therapists conducted the intervention after being trained in GroupCoreDIST for 5 days.&quot;</span>
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The physical therapists received a booklet with descriptions and photos of all exercises and variations, as well as the theoretical framework for the intervention.&quot;</span>

Reasoning:
The intervention was delivered by neurological physical therapists who received specific training for the trial. This suggests a more explanatory approach, as it involves a level of expertise and resources that may not be available in all usual care settings.

Score: [2]

5. Flexibility (delivery)

Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The physical therapists conducted an individual clinical examination of each participant. The examinations were followed by group sessions, in which the physical therapists chose from 33 exercises, all with 5 levels of difficulty to address each individual’s impairments underlying his or her balance disturbance.&quot;</span>

Reasoning:
The intervention was delivered with a high degree of flexibility, with physical therapists choosing from a variety of exercises and difficulty levels to individualize the intervention for each participant. This suggests a more pragmatic approach, as it mirrors the flexibility that would likely be present in a usual care setting.

Score: [4]

6. Flexibility (adherence)

Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants in the intervention group were encouraged not to seek any physical therapy other than GroupCoreDIST during the 6 weeks of the intervention.&quot;</span>

Reasoning:
The trial protocol required participants in the intervention group to adhere strictly to the GroupCoreDIST program and not seek any other physical therapy. This suggests a more explanatory approach, as it involves a level of adherence that may not be expected in a usual care setting.

Score: [2]

7. Follow-up

Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Assessments were undertaken at baseline and at weeks 7, 18, and 30.&quot;</span>

Reasoning:
The follow-up schedule for this trial involved assessments at multiple time points after the intervention. This suggests a more explanatory approach, as it involves a level of follow-up that may be more intensive than what would occur in a usual care setting.

Score: [2]

8. Primary outcome

Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The objective of this study was to compare the immediate and long-term effects of a 6-week individualized, group-based, comprehensive core stability intervention (GroupCoreDIST) with standard care on balance and trunk control in individuals with MS.&quot;</span>

Reasoning:
The primary outcome of this trial was balance and trunk control, which are outcomes that are likely to be of obvious importance to the participants. This suggests a more pragmatic approach, as it involves an outcome that is directly relevant to the participants' condition and daily life.

Score: [5]

9. Primary analysis

Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;To examine possible differences between groups over time, we performed an intention-to-treat analysis using repeated-measures mixed models in IBM SPSS Version 24.&quot;</span>

Reasoning:
The primary analysis for this trial was an intention-to-treat analysis, which includes all participants regardless of adherence to the intervention. This suggests a more pragmatic approach, as it mirrors the way in which interventions are typically evaluated in a usual care setting.

<p><i><span style="border-bottom: 1px dashed black;">10 quote(s) from
publication full text</span> (mean similarity 95.7%)</i></p>
<pre>
1. Eligibility criteria
- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Inclusion criteria were diagnosis of PPMS or SPMS, Internet access and some level of distress determined by a score of 3 or greater on the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12).&quot;</span>
- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Exclusion criteria were severe cognitive impairment, as determined by a score of 20 or smaller on the Telephone Interview for Cognitive Status-Modified (TICS-M) and high suicide risk, as assessed by a score of 20 or greater on the Clinical Outcome of Routine Evaluation (CORE-10).&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The trial includes patients with a specific type of MS (PPMS or SPMS) and excludes those with severe cognitive impairment or high suicide risk. This suggests that the trial is not fully representative of all patients with MS, but rather a specific subset. The use of specific measures (GHQ-12, TICS-M, CORE-10) to determine eligibility also suggests a more explanatory approach.
- Score: [2]

2. Recruitment
- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;We recruited 40 participants across the UK. A pilot trial of at least 30 participants is adequate for obtaining estimates of the standard deviation of the outcome variable to determine sample size for an efficacy trial.&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The trial recruited participants from across the UK, but it does not specify how these participants were recruited or whether the recruitment methods would be feasible in a usual care setting. Therefore, it is difficult to assess the pragmatism of the recruitment process.
- Score: [NA]

3. Setting
- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The treatment phase took place between February 2013 and July 2013. We delivered the programme in eight hour-long sessions over an eight-week period via Skype video conferences.&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The trial was conducted via Skype video conferences, which is not a typical setting for delivering interventions in usual care. This suggests a more explanatory approach as it may not reflect the real-world conditions under which the intervention would be delivered.
- Score: [2]

4. Organisation
- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;AB, a health psychologist, facilitated the courses. AB was supervised by PC, a clinical psychologist and expert mindfulness practitioner.&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The intervention was delivered by a health psychologist and supervised by a clinical psychologist, which suggests a level of expertise and resources that may not be available in a usual care setting. This suggests a more explanatory approach.
- Score: [2]

5. Flexibility (delivery)
- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;We delivered the programme in eight hour-long sessions over an eight-week period via Skype video conferences.&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The intervention was delivered in a highly structured manner, with specific session lengths and a set number of sessions. This suggests a more explanatory approach as it may not reflect the flexibility of intervention delivery in a usual care setting.
- Score: [2]

6. Flexibility (adherence)
- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;All the participants attended four or more of the eight mindfulness sessions and 14 (73.7%) attended six or more sessions.&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The trial seems to allow some flexibility in adherence, as not all participants attended all sessions. However, the full text does not provide enough information to fully assess this domain.
- Score: [NA]

7. Follow-up
- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants completed online questionnaires at baseline (prior to randomisation), post-intervention and three-month follow-up.&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The follow-up process involves online questionnaires at specific time points, which may not reflect the usual care setting where follow-up might be more flexible or based on individual patient needs. This suggests a more explanatory approach.
- Score: [2]

8. Primary outcome
- Quote: <span title='Major quote deviation, possible hallucination. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 56.6%):

distress, as measured by GHQ,' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: red'>&quot;The primary outcome was distress, as measured by GHQ.&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The primary outcome of distress is relevant to participants and is likely to be of interest in a usual care setting. However, the use of a specific measure (GHQ) may not reflect usual care where distress might be assessed in a less formal manner.
- Score: [4]

9. Primary analysis
- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Outcome analysis was conducted using Stata 12.1. To compare group demographic and clinical characteristics at baseline, we used a binomial test for equal proportions between groups for categorical variables and an independent t-test for equal means between groups for continuous variables.&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The trial uses statistical methods to analyze the data, which is typical of both pragmatic and explanatory trials. However, the full text does not provide enough information to fully assess this domain.
- Score: [NA]</pre>

<pre>
1. Eligibility criteria

Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The inclusion criteria were as follows: age > 18, confirmed diagnosis of MS, Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS): 2.0–6.5, Six Spot Step Test (SSST) score > 8 seconds or Timed 25-Foot Walk (T25FW) > 5 seconds, relapse-free within the past 8 weeks, and no adjustment of disease-modifying medication or medication that affects gait performance and spasticity within the past 8 weeks.&quot;</span>
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Exclusion criteria were as follows: co-morbidity in terms of cognitive disorders or alcohol abuse (based on clinical judgment), pathologies that did not allow systematic PRT >1 session/week within the last 3 months.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The eligibility criteria for this trial are quite specific, including both inclusion and exclusion criteria. The criteria are based on specific measures and tests, which may not be commonly used in usual care. This suggests a more explanatory approach.

Score: [2]

2. Recruitment

Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants were included from September 2016 to October 2018, after being invited via seven MS clinics (specified in “Acknowledgements” section) and targeted advertisements sent out via the Danish MS Society.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The recruitment process involved targeted invitations and advertisements, which may not be typical in usual care. This suggests a more explanatory approach.

Score: [2]

3. Setting

Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;This study was designed as a multi-centered, randomized control trial with two intervention groups and a control group (CON).&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial was conducted in multiple centers, which increases the generalizability of the results. This suggests a more pragmatic approach.

Score: [4]

4. Organisation

Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Groups of 3–6 patients were referred to physiotherapy clinics that were randomly assigned to provide either PRT or BMCT or to a waitlist CON.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The organization of the trial involved referral to physiotherapy clinics, which is a common practice in usual care. This suggests a more pragmatic approach.

Score: [4]

5. Flexibility (delivery)

Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The BMCT intervention was developed based on previously published programs and according to principle of the task-oriented approach.&quot;</span>
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;PRT consisted of 21-hour training sessions over 10 weeks (two sessions/week).&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The interventions were delivered in a structured and standardized manner, which may not be typical in usual care. This suggests a more explanatory approach.

Score: [2]

6. Flexibility (adherence)

Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;A total of 75% completed more than 15 out of the 20 sessions.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial allowed for some flexibility in adherence, as not all participants completed all sessions. This suggests a more pragmatic approach.

Score: [4]

7. Follow-up

Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The follow-up test was performed within 7 days of the last intervention session or after the last day of being on the waitlist.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The follow-up was conducted shortly after the intervention, which may not be typical in usual care. This suggests a more explanatory approach.

Score: [2]

8. Primary outcome

Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The primary outcomes were walking speed assessed by the T25FW and complex walking assessed by the SSST.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The primary outcomes are directly relevant to the participants and are likely to be measured in usual care. This suggests a more pragmatic approach.

Score: [5]

9. Primary analysis

Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Analyses were carried out as intention-to-treat, where all participants who completed the baseline assessment were included regardless of their adherence to the allocated intervention.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The analysis included all participants who completed the baseline assessment, regardless of their adherence to the intervention. This is consistent with an intention-to-treat analysis, which is typical in pragmatic trials.

<p><i><span style="border-bottom: 1px dashed black;">9 quote(s) from
publication full text</span> (mean similarity 100%)</i></p>
<pre>
1. Eligibility criteria

- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The inclusion criteria for the trial were clinical diagnosis of MS, as defined by the modified McDonald criteria, with an Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score of 1.0–6.5, and able to walk a 10-metre distance; aged 18–65 years; clinically stable for at least four weeks prior to entering the study; physically able to participate in exercise three times per week; able to provide written informed consent.&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The eligibility criteria for this trial are quite specific, including a certain range of EDSS scores, ability to walk a certain distance, and age range. This suggests that the trial may not be fully representative of all people with MS, particularly those with more severe disability or outside the specified age range. However, the criteria do not seem to exclude people based on factors such as comorbidities or responsiveness to the intervention, which would be more explanatory.
- Score: [3]

2. Recruitment

- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;A total of 120 PwMS were recruited via the Sheffield MS Clinic and flyers/community adverts displayed at the local South Yorkshire MS Society branches.&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The recruitment methods used in this trial, including recruitment from a specific clinic and through community advertisements, suggest a somewhat pragmatic approach. However, the use of a single clinic for recruitment may limit the generalizability of the results to other settings.
- Score: [4]

3. Setting

- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;During weeks 1–6, participants attended two supervised sessions per week at a university exercise research facility and engaged in one additional self-directed exercise session in their home environment.&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The trial was conducted in a university exercise research facility and in participants' home environments. This suggests a somewhat pragmatic approach, as it includes a setting (home) that is likely to be similar to where the intervention would be applied in usual care. However, the use of a university research facility may not be representative of all usual care settings.
- Score: [3]

4. Organisation

- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;An exercise physiologist supervised the delivery of the intervention but with physiotherapist input during the early stages of the programme.&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The intervention was delivered by an exercise physiologist with input from a physiotherapist, which may not be representative of the resources and expertise available in all usual care settings. However, the text does not specify any additional resources or training required beyond what might be available in some usual care settings.
- Score: [3]

5. Flexibility (delivery)

- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The prescribed strength training was based on individual functional needs, as assessed by the trial physiotherapist (NS). Strength training was undertaken by 48 of 60 participants in the intervention group and typically involved two to six different resistance exercises (e.g. wall press-ups, arm-curls, leg abduction, wall squats and/or regular squats, knee extensions, calf raises, sit-to-stand) each session.&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The intervention was somewhat flexible in terms of delivery, with strength training exercises tailored to individual functional needs. However, the intervention was still somewhat prescriptive, with specific exercises recommended and supervised sessions provided.
- Score: [3]

6. Flexibility (adherence)

- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Adherence to the supervised and home-exercise sessions was very good, with participants attending an average of 16.2 of the 18 supervised sessions (90%; range 7–18 sessions) and participating in an average of 14.6 of the 18 prescribed home-exercise sessions (81%, range 2–18 sessions).&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The trial did not appear to have strict measures in place to ensure adherence to the intervention, and adherence was generally high. This suggests a somewhat pragmatic approach to adherence.
- Score: [4]

7. Follow-up

- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Outcomes were assessed at baseline, and at three months (post-intervention) and nine months after randomisation.&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The follow-up schedule in this trial, with assessments at three and nine months after randomisation, does not seem to be more intense than what might be expected in usual care. However, the text does not provide enough information to fully assess this domain.
- Score: [NA]

8. Primary outcome

- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The primary outcome was self-reported exercise behaviour at three months using the Godin Leisure Time Exercise Questionnaire (GLTEQ).&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The primary outcome of self-reported exercise behavior is likely to be relevant to participants and is measured in a way that is similar to how it might be assessed in usual care. This suggests a pragmatic approach to the primary outcome.
- Score: [5]

9. Primary analysis

- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;All analyses were by intention to treat, whereby participants were analysed in the arm to which they were randomised irrespective of whether they complied with the intervention.&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The use of intention-to-treat analysis, which includes all participants regardless of their adherence to the intervention, suggests a pragmatic approach to the primary analysis.
- Score: [5]</pre>

publication full text</span> (mean similarity 100%)</i></p>
<pre>
1. Eligibility criteria

Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants with a diagnosis of MS and clinical levels of depression were recruited through out-patient clinics and postal screening questionnaires at two UK centres and randomised to CCBT or usual care.&quot;</span>
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Inclusion criteria were: age of 18 years or above; BDI score of at least 14 on two consecutive occasions and no treatment from psychologist, psychotherapist or psychiatrist within the last three months.&quot;</span>
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Exclusion criteria were: poor English language skills or cognitive function (score of less than 24 on Mini Mental State Examination [20]); BDI score of at least 29 on two consecutive occasions; active suicidal ideas; current or life-time diagnosis of psychosis, organic mental disorder or substance dependency; Kurtzke Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score of 8.5 or above [21]).&quot;</span>

Reasoning:
The eligibility criteria for this trial are quite specific, excluding individuals with severe depression, active suicidal ideas, certain mental disorders, and poor cognitive function. This suggests that the trial is aiming to recruit a relatively homogeneous group of participants with MS and clinical levels of depression, which may not fully represent the broader population of individuals with MS who might receive the intervention in a real-world setting.

Score: [2]

2. Recruitment

Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants with a diagnosis of MS and clinical levels of depression were recruited through out-patient clinics and postal screening questionnaires at two UK centres and randomised to CCBT or usual care.&quot;</span>
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The recruitment rate, calculated as the proportion of those invited to fill in a screening questionnaire who were consented into the trial, was 4.1%.&quot;</span>

Reasoning:
The recruitment process involved both out-patient clinics and postal screening questionnaires, which suggests some effort to reach a diverse range of potential participants. However, the recruitment rate was quite low, indicating that the trial may not have been able to attract a representative sample of the broader population of individuals with MS and depression.

Score: [3]

3. Setting

Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants with a diagnosis of MS and clinical levels of depression were recruited through out-patient clinics and postal screening questionnaires at two UK centres and randomised to CCBT or usual care.&quot;</span>

Reasoning:
The trial was conducted at two UK centres, which suggests some effort to ensure that the results would be applicable to different settings. However, the full text does not provide enough information to assess how similar these centres are to the usual care settings where the intervention might be applied.

Score: [NA]

4. Organisation

Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;In the Sheffield region, Primary Care Trust (PCT) mental health care teams administered the CCBT, facilitating access and undertaking safety monitoring.&quot;</span>
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;In the Liverpool region, a specialist neuropsychologist, based in the acute hospital facilitated access to and provided technical advice on CCBT, but did not provide additional therapeutic input.&quot;</span>

Reasoning:
The trial made use of existing healthcare staff and resources in the two centres, suggesting a pragmatic approach to the organisation of care. However, the level of support provided to participants varied between the two centres, which could potentially affect the applicability of the trial results.

Score: [4]

5. Flexibility (delivery)

Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;After consent, we randomised participants either to CCBT using ‘Beating the Blues’ ® (Ultrasis Ltd) or to usual care.&quot;</span>
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Beating the Blues ® consists of eight computer-interactive sessions, of approximately 50 minutes each in duration, designed to be taken weekly.&quot;</span>

Reasoning:
The intervention was delivered using a standardised computerised program, which suggests a relatively inflexible approach to delivery. However, the full text does not provide enough information to assess how much flexibility providers had in adapting the intervention to individual participants' needs.

Score: [NA]

6. Flexibility (adherence)

Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Of the 12 patients in the CCBT arm, 9 (75%) completed at least four CCBT sessions. This translated to a reasonably high compliance rate of CCBT although only six (50%) of the patients in this arm completed all intended eight CCBT sessions.&quot;</span>

Reasoning:
The trial allowed for some flexibility in participants' adherence to the intervention, as evidenced by the fact that not all participants completed all eight CCBT sessions. However, the full text does not provide enough information to assess whether any measures were in place to encourage or enforce adherence.

Score: [NA]

7. Follow-up

Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Clinical outcomes included the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II) and Multiple Sclerosis Impact Scale (MSIS-29) at baseline, 8 and 21 weeks.&quot;</span>
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Two participants in each arm were lost to follow-up at 21 weeks post-randomisation.&quot;</span>

Reasoning:
The trial included follow-up assessments at 8 and 21 weeks, which suggests a relatively intensive approach to follow-up. However, the full text does not provide enough information to assess how this level of follow-up compares to usual care.

Score: [NA]

8. Primary outcome

Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The primary clinical endpoint was the mean change in self-reported symptoms of depression as measured on the BDI.&quot;</span>
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants expressed concern about the face validity of the Beck Depression Inventory II for the measurement of self-reported depression in people with MS.&quot;</span>

Reasoning:
The primary outcome of the trial was self-reported symptoms of depression, which is a patient-relevant outcome. However, participants expressed concerns about the validity of the measure used, suggesting that it may not fully capture their experiences of depression.

Score: [4]

9. Primary analysis

Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Primary analysis was an Intention To Treat (ITT) analysis which analysed all 24 participants according to their randomised treatment assignment ignoring non compliance, protocol deviations and withdrawal.&quot;</span>

Reasoning:
The trial used an intention-to-treat analysis, which is a pragmatic approach to analysis as it includes all participants regardless of their adherence to the intervention or withdrawal from the trial.

<pre>
1. Eligibility criteria

- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Key inclusion criteria permitted the participation of men or women ≥18 years of age with confirmed and documented RRMS diagnosis (as defined by the Revised McDonald criteria), Kurtzke Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score of 0 to 5.5 at the screening visit, and, 30 days prior to randomization, a stable neurological condition, relapse-free status, and no use of any corticosteroid or adrenocorticotropic hormone treatment.&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The eligibility criteria for this trial are quite specific, including only patients with a confirmed diagnosis of RRMS, a specific EDSS score, and a stable neurological condition. This suggests that the trial is more explanatory in nature, as it is not including a broad range of patients who might be seen in usual care.
- Score: [2]

2. Recruitment

- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The CONFIDENCE study was a multinational, multicenter, randomized, parallel-group, phase 4, open-label study conducted at 88 study centers in 14 countries across different geographic regions.&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The recruitment process for this trial appears to be quite extensive, involving multiple centers across various countries. This suggests a more pragmatic approach, as it attempts to include a diverse range of patients from different settings.
- Score: [4]

3. Setting

- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The CONFIDENCE study was a multinational, multicenter, randomized, parallel-group, phase 4, open-label study conducted at 88 study centers in 14 countries across different geographic regions.&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The trial was conducted in multiple centers across various countries, suggesting a more pragmatic approach as it attempts to replicate the diverse settings in which the intervention might be applied in usual care.
- Score: [4]

4. Organisation

- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Eligible patients were randomly assigned 1:1 to receive subcutaneous injections of GA40 (n = 431) or GA20 (n = 430).&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The trial required specific resources and expertise to deliver the intervention, including the ability to administer subcutaneous injections. This suggests a more explanatory approach, as it may not reflect the resources and expertise available in all usual care settings.
- Score: [2]

5. Flexibility (delivery)

- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Eligible patients were randomly assigned 1:1 to receive subcutaneous injections of GA40 (n = 431) or GA20 (n = 430).&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The delivery of the intervention in this trial is quite rigid, with patients being randomly assigned to receive one of two specific treatments. This suggests a more explanatory approach, as it does not allow for flexibility in how the intervention is delivered based on individual patient needs or preferences.
- Score: [2]

6. Flexibility (adherence)

- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Adherence to treatment when the dosing schedule differs is complicated, because missing one dose has potentially differential impacts on treatment.&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The trial acknowledges the complexity of adherence to the treatment, but does not provide any flexibility for patients in terms of their adherence to the intervention. This suggests a more explanatory approach, as it does not reflect the variability in adherence that might be seen in usual care.
- Score: [2]

7. Follow-up

- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Five scheduled visits at study sites occurred at screening (within 2 weeks prior to baseline), baseline (Month 0), and Months 1, 3, and 6 (end of the core phase).&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The follow-up schedule in this trial is quite rigid, with specific visits scheduled at predetermined times. This suggests a more explanatory approach, as it does not allow for the variability in follow-up that might be seen in usual care.
- Score: [2]

8. Primary outcome

- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The primary endpoint was patient-reported medication satisfaction using the Medication Satisfaction Questionnaire (MSQ).&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The primary outcome of this trial is patient-reported medication satisfaction, which is highly relevant to patients. This suggests a more pragmatic approach, as it focuses on an outcome that is directly important to the patients.
- Score: [5]

9. Primary analysis

- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis set included all randomly assigned participants and were analyzed according to the treatment group to which they were randomly assigned, regardless of which treatment they actually received.&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The primary analysis in this trial is an intention-to-treat analysis, which includes all randomly assigned participants regardless of which treatment they actually received. This suggests a more pragmatic approach, as it reflects the reality of treatment delivery in usual care, where not all patients may receive the intended treatment.

publication full text</span> (mean similarity 99.6%)</i></p>
<pre>
1. Eligibility criteria:

Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;To be included, people had to be aged 18 years or more, have a confirmed diagnosis of relapsing–remitting MS, have an Ambulation Index score 19 of 2, 3 or 4 (mild to moderate walking disabilities), and have received medical clearance to participate.&quot;</span>
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Volunteers were excluded if they had an acute exacerbation of MS within 2 months of starting the program, had benign or progressive/relapsing types of MS, had a serious unstable medical condition, had any concurrent condition, for example stroke, or had participated in a PRT program in the 6 months before training started.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The eligibility criteria for this trial are quite specific, excluding individuals with certain types of MS, those who have had a recent exacerbation, and those with other medical conditions. This suggests that the trial is more explanatory in nature, as it does not include all individuals who might receive the intervention in a real-world setting.

Score: [2]

2. Recruitment:

Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants were recruited through a statewide organization providing education and support to people with MS, and a large specialist MS outpatient clinic.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The recruitment process involved reaching out to potential participants through a statewide organization and a specialist clinic. This approach is somewhat pragmatic as it involves recruiting from existing healthcare structures, but it may not fully represent the diversity of individuals who would receive the intervention in a real-world setting.

Score: [3]

3. Setting:

Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The experimental group completed a 10-week (two times per week), PRT program in one of four community gymnasiums in metropolitan and regional areas.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial was conducted in community gymnasiums, which is a pragmatic choice of setting as it reflects where the intervention would likely be implemented in a real-world setting.

Score: [5]

4. Organisation:

Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Each program was attended by a group of up to 12 participants, and they were supervised by up to three experienced trainers (physiotherapists and registered personal sports trainers).&quot;</span>
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Each exercise session was completed in around 45 min, and at the end of each session there was a 30-min recovery period when the participants had refreshments and time to socialize.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The organization of the trial intervention required additional resources and expertise beyond what would typically be available in usual care, including experienced trainers and structured exercise sessions. This suggests a more explanatory approach.

Score: [2]

5. Flexibility (delivery):

Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;While these were the core exercises, they could be individualized. For example, if any exercise caused discomfort, the starting position was modified or the exercise was replaced.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The intervention allowed for some flexibility in the delivery of the exercises, with modifications made as needed for individual participants. This suggests a somewhat pragmatic approach.

Score: [4]

6. Flexibility (adherence):

Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;People in the training program attended a mean of 18.4 (SD 2.9, range 6–20) of their 20 scheduled sessions, while people in the social program attended a mean of 6.2 (SD 3.1, range 0–10) of their 10 scheduled sessions.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial did not appear to have strict measures in place to ensure participant adherence to the intervention, as evidenced by the range of sessions attended. This suggests a more pragmatic approach.

Score: [4]

7. Follow-up:

Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Outcome measurements were taken three times: at baseline, after 10 weeks to determine the immediate effects of the intervention, and after a further 12 weeks (week 22) to determine if any benefits from the program had been sustained.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The follow-up schedule in this trial is more intensive than what would typically occur in usual care, suggesting a more explanatory approach.

Score: [2]

8. Primary outcome:

Quotes:
- <span title='Moderate quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 94.8%):

Our results suggest that contrary to our predictions, PRT did not improve walking performance in adults with relapsing–remitting MS and mild to moderate walking di' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ff9e81'>&quot;Our results suggest that contrary to our predictions, PRT did not improve walking performance in adults with relapsing–remitting MS and mild to moderate walking difficulty.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The primary outcome of walking performance is highly relevant to participants and reflects a pragmatic choice of outcome.

Score: [5]

9. Primary analysis:

Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Analysis was completed without Bonferroni adjustment because we decided that this would have resulted in a risk of missing real effects (type II errors) and the consequences of any type I errors would not lead to any negative effects on participants.&quot;</span>
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Intention-to-treat analysis was applied, with all participants who were allocated and commenced their program included in analysis.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial used an intention-to-treat analysis, which is a pragmatic approach as it includes all participants regardless of adherence to the intervention.

<pre>
1. Eligibility criteria

Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Adults with MS were included based on the ability to walk 5 km without rest or use of assistive device.&quot;</span>
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Exclusion criteria were reports to have run 5 km in the preceding 6 months or a relapse occurring in the preceding 3 months.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The eligibility criteria for this trial are quite specific, excluding those who have run 5 km in the past 6 months or have had a relapse in the past 3 months. This suggests that the trial is targeting a specific subset of MS patients who are capable of walking 5 km without rest or assistive devices but are not currently engaged in regular running exercise. This may limit the generalizability of the trial results to the broader MS population.

Score: [2]

2. Recruitment

Quotes:
- <span title='Moderate quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 91.6%):

Adults with MS were recruited through announcements at REVAL rehabilitation research institute (UHasselt), Flemish MS rehabilitation centers and MS Society, and Move-to-Sport.' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ff9e81'>&quot;Adults with multiple sclerosis were recruited through announcements at REVAL rehabilitation research institute (UHasselt), Flemish MS rehabilitation centers and MS Society, and Move-to-Sport.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The recruitment process involved reaching out to potential participants through various channels, including rehabilitation institutes, MS rehabilitation centers, and the MS Society. This suggests a somewhat pragmatic approach, as these are places where people with MS are likely to be found in usual care. However, the use of these specific channels may also limit the generalizability of the trial results to those who are connected with these organizations.

Score: [3]

3. Setting

Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Evaluation was performed at REVAL by a study nurse, a PhD student in Rehabilitation Sciences and Physiotherapy, and the project dedicated researcher (MSc in exercise physiology, PhD).&quot;</span>
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Neural imaging was recorded at UZA (University Hospital Antwerp, in Wilrijk) on another day mostly within 1-week time period.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial was conducted in a research institute and a university hospital, which are not typical settings for usual care. This suggests a more explanatory approach, as the results may not be directly applicable to other settings where MS patients typically receive care.

Score: [2]

4. Organisation

Quotes:
- <span title='Moderate quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 94.6%):

S received training instructions by email. They were asked to train three times weekly according to a personalized training intensity schedule that was based on their baseline aerobic capacity.' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ff9e81'>&quot;Participants received training instructions by email. They were asked to train three times weekly according to a personalized training intensity schedule that was based on their baseline aerobic capacity.&quot;</span>
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;pwMS wore an activity tracker (Withings Pulse Ox) at the waist that registered the intensity of steps per minute.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial required additional resources and expertise beyond what would typically be available in usual care, including personalized training instructions, email communication, and activity trackers. This suggests a more explanatory approach, as these resources may not be readily available in all usual care settings.

Score: [2]

5. Flexibility (delivery)

Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;During the first weeks, training consisted of longer walking bouts, interspersed with short 1′ running bouts. The relative amount of running gradually increased until participants were able to run 5 km without interruption at 12 weeks.&quot;</span>
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants were asked to weekly upload data to allow remote supervision of the training adherence by the research assistant.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The intervention was delivered in a highly structured manner, with specific instructions for how to gradually increase running bouts over the 12-week period. Participants were also required to upload data for remote supervision, which may not be feasible in usual care. This suggests a more explanatory approach.

Score: [2]

6. Flexibility (adherence)

Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The EXP group completed 607 of 648 prescribed sessions (94%).&quot;</span>
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;If a participant had been inactive, a phone call was made for enquiry.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial required high adherence to the intervention, with participants expected to complete three training sessions per week. If a participant was inactive, they were contacted by phone. This level of monitoring and enforcement of adherence is not typical in usual care, suggesting a more explanatory approach.

Score: [2]

7. Follow-up

Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Patients were tested at two time points (0 and 12 weeks).&quot;</span>
- <span title='Moderate quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 84.7%):

was offered a comparable training program after the final measurements.' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ff9e81'>&quot;The WLC group was offered a comparable training program after the final measurements.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The follow-up period in this trial was relatively short, with only two time points for testing. This is not typical of usual care, where follow-up may be more frequent and over a longer period. However, the control group was offered the intervention after the trial, which is a pragmatic approach.

Score: [3]

8. Primary outcome

Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The primary outcome measures were physical fitness, walking capacity and perceived ability, functional mobility, and quality of life.&quot;</span>
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Secondary outcome measures were fatigue, cognitive function, brain volumes, and structural connectivity.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The primary outcomes of this trial are highly relevant to participants, including physical fitness, walking capacity, functional mobility, and quality of life. These outcomes are likely to be of interest in usual care as well, suggesting a pragmatic approach.

Score: [5]

9. Primary analysis

Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Groups were compared by means of a linear mixed model analysis which accounts for fixed and random effects (participants). These models adjust for confounding variables and dropout. Intention-to-treat analysis was performed.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial used an intention-to-treat analysis, which includes all data and is a pragmatic approach. This type of analysis is likely to be applicable in usual care, where not all patients may adhere to the intervention.

Eligibility Criteria:
1. Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Of the fifteen study participants, all had previously received a diagnosis of multiple sclerosis.&quot;</span>
2. Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The inclusion criterion for the study was a diagnosis of multiple sclerosis, and therefore the spectrum of clinical presentations was broad, as would be expected in this client population.&quot;</span>
3. Reasoning: The study includes anyone with a diagnosis of multiple sclerosis, which is a broad and inclusive criterion. There is no mention of excluding any subgroups within this population, such as those with certain comorbidities or severity of disease. However, all participants had prior experience of massage treatment at the clinic, which might limit the generalizability of the results.
4. Score: [4]

Recruitment:
1. Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Clients were provided with information about the clinic by the local chapter of the Multiple Sclerosis Society, and self selected on that basis.&quot;</span>
2. Reasoning: The recruitment process seems to be fairly pragmatic, as it involves providing information about the clinic to potential participants and allowing them to self-select into the study. However, it's not clear whether this method of recruitment would be used in usual care.
3. Score: [4]

Setting:
1. Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The research undertaken was a practical trial that investigated the effects of a pragmatic massage therapy treatment protocol using a prospective randomized pretest, posttest waitlist control design.&quot;</span>
2. Reasoning: The study was conducted in a practical setting, which suggests a high level of pragmatism. However, the full text does not provide specific details about the setting, such as whether it was a typical care setting for multiple sclerosis patients.
3. Score: [NA]

Organization:
1. Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;All treatments were delivered by supervised student therapists in the final term of their two year massage therapy program.&quot;</span>
2. Reasoning: The organization of the intervention delivery is somewhat explanatory, as it involves supervised student therapists delivering the treatments. This may not reflect the usual care setting where experienced therapists would likely deliver the intervention.

Flexibility (Delivery):
1. Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The heterogeneity of the client/participant population precluded an overly prescriptive approach to treatment, and it is worth noting that this heterogeneity is also a component of the normal clinical reality of therapists involved with multiple sclerosis clients.&quot;</span>
2. Reasoning: The intervention delivery is flexible and tailored to the individual needs of the participants, which is a pragmatic approach. However, the full text does not provide specific details about the flexibility of the intervention delivery.

2. Reasoning: The follow-up schedule is more intense than what would typically occur under usual care, with multiple follow-up points throughout the treatment and post-treatment period. This suggests a more explanatory approach.
3. Score: [2]

Primary Outcome:
1. Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Self-Efficacy [SE] was the outcome for the study, measured using the Multiple Sclerosis Self-Efficacy survey [MSSE].&quot;</span>
2. Reasoning: The primary outcome of self-efficacy is relevant to participants and is measured in a way that is similar to how it would be measured in usual care. This suggests a pragmatic approach.
3. Score: [5]

Primary Analysis:
1. Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The data were analyzed on an intention to treat basis, with a focus on the differences between mean MSSE values of the control and intervention groups.&quot;</span>
2. Reasoning: The primary analysis includes all data and is conducted on an intention-to-treat basis, which is a pragmatic approach. There is no mention of excluding any data or participants from the analysis.

<pre>
1. Eligibility criteria

Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Key inclusion criteria were age older than 18 years, a diagnosis of progressive multiple sclerosis (primary or secondary) according to McDonald’s criteria, and a score of 6·5–8·0 on the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS).&quot;</span>
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Key exclusion criteria were being within 3 months of ceasing a multiple sclerosis disease modifying drug, receiving steroid treatment within the preceding month, or participating in another clinical trial.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The eligibility criteria for this trial are quite specific, focusing on individuals with progressive multiple sclerosis and severe mobility impairment. This suggests that the trial is not fully representative of all individuals with multiple sclerosis, but rather a specific subset of this population. The exclusion criteria also limit the generalizability of the trial results, as they exclude individuals who have recently ceased a disease modifying drug, received steroid treatment, or are participating in another clinical trial.

Score: [2]

2. Recruitment

Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants were recruited through eight health care organisations, including the UK National Health Service (NHS) Trusts, social enterprises, and third sector multiple sclerosis therapy centres, in two regions (Devon–Cornwall and East Anglia) of the UK.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The recruitment process for this trial was conducted through various health care organizations, which suggests a somewhat pragmatic approach. However, the recruitment was limited to two specific regions in the UK, which may limit the generalizability of the trial results to other regions or countries.

Score: [3]

3. Setting

Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The study was fully funded by the National Institute of Health Research (Research for Patient Benefit Programme; PB-PG 1013–32047), UK.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial was conducted in a research setting, funded by the National Institute of Health Research. This suggests that the setting of the trial may not be fully representative of usual care settings where the intervention would be applied.

Score: [2]

4. Organisation

Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The intervention consisted of two home-based physiotherapy sessions (60 min each) to set up the standing frame programme, supported by six follow-up telephone calls (15 min per call).&quot;</span>
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The intervention was delivered by physiotherapists working within the NHS, who did not undergo specific training for this intervention, making it likely that similar results would be gained on implementation within usual practice.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The organization of the intervention involved home-based physiotherapy sessions and follow-up telephone calls, which suggests a somewhat pragmatic approach. However, the intervention was delivered by physiotherapists, which may not be representative of usual care settings where the intervention would be applied.

Score: [3]

5. Flexibility (delivery)

Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants were asked to stand in the frame for 30 min three times per week over 20 weeks, and to record the frequency and duration of each stand in a daily diary.&quot;</span>
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;At the end of the 20 week period, participants were encouraged to continue to regularly stand, although no further physiotherapy support was provided.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The delivery of the intervention was somewhat flexible, with participants asked to stand in the frame for a specified amount of time each week, but with the ability to choose when to do so. However, the requirement to record the frequency and duration of each stand in a daily diary suggests a level of rigidity in the delivery of the intervention.

Score: [3]

6. Flexibility (adherence)

Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Our CACE analysis showed that accounting for compliance to the intervention resulted in a larger estimated intervention effect, with the prespecified minimal clinically important difference of 9 points on the AMCA score contained within the 95% CIs of all six compliance definitions.&quot;</span>
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Two thirds of the participants in the standing frame group continued to stand regularly in the frame during the 36 week period, which, in light of the literature, we consider to be a high proportion.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial allowed for some flexibility in adherence to the intervention, with participants encouraged but not required to continue standing regularly in the frame after the 20-week period. However, adherence to the intervention was monitored and factored into the analysis of the trial results.

Score: [3]

7. Follow-up

Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;After baseline assessment, participants were randomised (1:1) by computer-generated assignment to either a standing frame programme plus usual care or usual care alone.&quot;</span>
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The primary clinical outcome was motor function measured by the Amended Motor Club Assessment (AMCA) score at week 36, analysed in the modified intention-to-treat population.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The follow-up in this trial was quite intensive, with participants assessed at baseline, 20 weeks, and 36 weeks. This level of follow-up is likely more intensive than would be typical in usual care settings.

Score: [2]

8. Primary outcome

Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The primary outcome was motor function as measured by the Amended Motor Club Assessment (AMCA) score at the primary endpoint of 36 weeks post-randomisation.&quot;</span>
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The use of the standing frame resulted in a significant increase in AMCA score compared with that for usual care alone, with a fully adjusted between-group difference in AMCA score at 36 weeks of 4·7 points (95% CI 1·9–7·5; p=0·0014).&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The primary outcome of this trial, motor function as measured by the AMCA score, is likely to be highly relevant to participants, as it directly measures their ability to perform key functional activities.

Score: [5]

9. Primary analysis

Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The primary analysis of the primary outcome, AMCA score at 36 weeks, followed a modified intention to treat approach, regardless of compliance to the intervention, but did exclude patients who were deemed ineligible after randomisation, those who withdrew from the trial and were unwilling for their previously collected data to be used, or those who did not provide baseline and week 36 measurements.&quot;</span>
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The primary analysis population was defined as all participants who completed baseline and 36-week assessments.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The primary analysis of this trial included all data from participants who completed baseline and 36-week assessments, regardless of compliance to the intervention. This suggests a pragmatic approach to the analysis of the trial results.

<pre>
1. Eligibility criteria
- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Eligible participants were over 18 years of age and had a diagnosis of MS that was confirmed by a consultant physician or neurologist. Persons with MS were excluded if they had a previous relapse or began steroid therapy in the 12 weeks prior to participating in the first assessment, were pregnant, or had a comorbidity that severely impacted their ability to safely participate in exercise.&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The eligibility criteria for this trial are quite specific and exclude a number of potential participants, such as those who have had a recent relapse, are pregnant, or have a comorbidity that impacts their ability to exercise safely. This suggests a more explanatory approach, as the trial is not including all individuals who might receive the intervention in a real-world setting.
- Score: [2]

2. Recruitment
- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Our study participants were referred to the project by themselves, their care-giver, MSI, chartered physiotherapists, neurologists, general practitioners or clinical nurse specialists.&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The recruitment process for this trial involved a variety of sources, including self-referral, referral by caregivers, and referral by various healthcare professionals. This suggests a more pragmatic approach, as it mirrors the variety of ways in which individuals might come to participate in such an intervention in a real-world setting.
- Score: [4]

3. Setting
- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;This trial took place from April 2008 to October 2009, in 10 regions across the Republic of Ireland.&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The trial was conducted in multiple regions across Ireland, suggesting a more pragmatic approach as it reflects the diversity of settings in which the intervention might be implemented in the real world.
- Score: [5]

4. Organisation
- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;All interventions took place in groups of eight, for an hour per week, for 10 weeks. They were delivered in community centres such as local gyms, hotels and health centres.&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The organisation of the trial intervention appears to be quite pragmatic, as it was delivered in community settings and did not require any additional resources beyond what would typically be available in these settings.
- Score: [5]

5. Flexibility (delivery)
- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The PT-led exercise provided was pre-defined. It consisted of a circuit-style class of exercises that were either resisted by body weight or by the addition of free weights.&quot;</span>
- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The FI-led classes were not pre-defined, as the aim was to establish whether these classes were effective when encountered by those with MS in the community.&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The trial shows a mix of flexibility in delivery. The PT-led exercise was pre-defined with a specific set of exercises, suggesting a more explanatory approach. However, the FI-led classes were not pre-defined, which is more pragmatic as it allows for variability in how the intervention is delivered.
- Score: [3]

6. Flexibility (adherence)
- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Treatment fidelity was optimised by the instructors and participants documenting programme adherence.&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The trial required participants to document their adherence to the programme, suggesting a more explanatory approach as this level of monitoring and documentation may not be typical in a real-world setting.
- Score: [2]

7. Follow-up
- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants were randomised in groups of eight to physiotherapist (PT)-led exercise (n = 80), yoga (n = 77), fitness instructor (FI)-led exercise (n = 86) and they took part in weekly community-based group exercise sessions. Those in the control group were asked not to change of their exercise habits (n = 71). The primary outcome was the Multiple Sclerosis Impact Scale (MSIS) 29v2 physical component, measured before and after the 10-week intervention.&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The follow-up in this trial involved measuring the primary outcome before and after the 10-week intervention, which is a relatively standard approach in clinical trials. This suggests a more explanatory approach, as it involves a level of monitoring and data collection that may not be typical in a real-world setting.
- Score: [2]

8. Primary outcome
- Quote: <span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 99.5%):

The primary outcome measure was the physical component of the Multiple Sclerosis Impact Scale29, version 2 (MSIS-29v2), a patient-reported outcome measure that assesses the physical impact of MS.' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;The primary outcome measure was the physical component of the Multiple Sclerosis Impact Scale-29, version 2 (MSIS-29v2), a patient-reported outcome measure that assesses the physical impact of MS.&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The primary outcome of this trial is patient-reported and directly relevant to the participants' experience of their condition, suggesting a more pragmatic approach.
- Score: [5]

9. Primary analysis
- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;All participants were analysed in the groups to which they were randomised.&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The trial used an intention-to-treat analysis, which is a more pragmatic approach as it includes all participants in the analysis regardless of their adherence to the intervention.

1. Eligibility criteria:
- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;CARE-MS II, a 2-year randomized, rater-blinded, active-controlled, head-to-head, phase 3 trial, compared efficacy and safety of alemtuzumab 12 mg with subcutaneous interferon-b-1a (SC IFN-b-1a) 44 mg in patients with RRMS.&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The trial included patients with RRMS who had an inadequate response to prior disease-modifying therapies. This suggests that the trial was designed to include a specific subset of patients with RRMS, which may not fully represent the broader population of patients with RRMS in usual care. 
- Score: [3]

2. Recruitment:
- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;In total, 202 and 426 CARE-MS II patients were randomized to SC IFN-b-1a 44 mg and alemtuzumab 12 mg, respectively.&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The text does not provide specific details on how participants were recruited into the trial. Therefore, it is not possible to assess the pragmatism of the recruitment process based on the provided text.

- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Alemtuzumab (Lemtrada; Sanofi Genzyme, Cambridge, MA; 12 mg/day on 5 consecutive days at month 0 and on 3 consecutive days at month 12) vs SC IFN-b-1a (Rebif; EMD Serono, Rockland, MA; 44 mg 3 times weekly)&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The trial required the administration of specific doses of the interventions at specific times, which may not reflect the flexibility of administration in usual care. This suggests a more explanatory approach to the organisation of care delivery in the trial.
- Score: [2]

5. Flexibility (delivery):
- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Alemtuzumab (Lemtrada; Sanofi Genzyme, Cambridge, MA; 12 mg/day on 5 consecutive days at month 0 and on 3 consecutive days at month 12) vs SC IFN-b-1a (Rebif; EMD Serono, Rockland, MA; 44 mg 3 times weekly)&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The trial protocol specified the doses and timing of the interventions, which suggests a more explanatory approach to the flexibility of intervention delivery. In usual care, the delivery of interventions may be more flexible and tailored to individual patient needs.
- Score: [2]

6. Flexibility (adherence):
- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Alemtuzumab-treated patients were more likely than SC IFN-b-1a–treated patients to show improvement in EDSS scores (p , 0.0001) on all 7 functional systems.&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The text does not provide specific details on measures taken to ensure participants' adherence to the interventions. Therefore, it is not possible to assess the pragmatism of the adherence process based on the provided text.
- Score: [NA]

7. Follow-up:
- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Blinded raters performed EDSS assessments at baseline, every 3 months, and when relapse was suspected.&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The trial included regular follow-up assessments every 3 months, which may be more frequent than in usual care. This suggests a more explanatory approach to the follow-up process.
- Score: [2]

8. Primary outcome:
- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The following CARE-MS II tertiary endpoints were assessed: time to CDI ($1.0-point EDSS decrease from baseline sustained for $3 or $6 months, in patients with baseline score $2.0); proportion worsened ($0.5-point increase), stable, or improved ($0.5-point decrease) from baseline EDSS.&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The primary outcome of the trial was based on changes in EDSS scores, which is a clinically relevant measure of disability in patients with MS. This suggests a more pragmatic approach to the choice of primary outcome.

1. Eligibility criteria:

Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;A total of 150 patients were randomly assigned to the intervention (n  76) or to UC (n  74).&quot;</span>
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Neurologists verified all patients for the following inclusion criteria: 1) diagnosis of relapsing-remitting (but no more than 2 exacerbations within the last year) or secondary progressive MS 21 and 2) an Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) 22 score of 6 (no to moderately severe disability), with 1 step increase within the last year.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The eligibility criteria for this trial were quite specific, including only patients with a diagnosis of relapsing-remitting or secondary progressive MS and an EDSS score of 6 or less. This suggests that the trial was not designed to be highly pragmatic in terms of participant selection, as it excluded a significant portion of the MS population.

Score: [2]

2. Recruitment:

Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;A total of 164 patients with MS referred themselves after having received information via the outpatient neurology clinic of the University Hospital Basel, other physicians, or advertisements posted in the Swiss Multiple Sclerosis Society Bulletin.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The recruitment process for this trial involved patients self-referring after receiving information from various sources. This suggests a somewhat pragmatic approach, as it mirrors the way patients might learn about and choose to participate in a treatment in a real-world setting. However, the use of advertisements in a bulletin may not be a typical method of recruitment in usual care.

Score: [4]

3. Setting:

Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The study was conducted from February 2007 to March 2009.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The full text does not provide specific information about the setting of the trial, such as the type of clinic or geographical location. Therefore, it is not possible to assess this domain based on the available information.

Score: [NA]

4. Organisation:

Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;MBI consisted of a structured 8-week program of mindfulness training.&quot;</span>
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Each class covered specific exercises and topics within the context of mindfulness training, i.e., practices during lying, sitting, and dynamic yoga postures, as well as during everyday life, e.g., stressful situations and social interactions.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The organisation of the intervention in this trial involved a structured 8-week program of mindfulness training, with specific exercises and topics covered in each class. This suggests a more explanatory approach, as the intervention was highly structured and may not reflect the variability and flexibility often seen in usual care.

Score: [2]

5. Flexibility (delivery):

Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The most pragmatic design approach to delivery flexibility would leave the details of how to implement the intervention up to providers, in other words, what happens in usual care.&quot;</span>
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;MBI participants reported practicing, on average, 5.11 times/week (SD 2.24; CI 4.59 –5.64 times), a total time average of 76% of assigned homework (SD 13.80; CI 72.76%–79.25%).&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The delivery of the intervention in this trial was somewhat flexible, with participants practicing on their own time and at their own pace. However, the intervention was still based on a structured program, suggesting a balance between explanatory and pragmatic approaches.

Score: [3]

6. Flexibility (adherence):

Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;MBI participants reported practicing, on average, 5.11 times/week (SD 2.24; CI 4.59 –5.64 times), a total time average of 76% of assigned homework (SD 13.80; CI 72.76%–79.25%).&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The adherence to the intervention in this trial was somewhat flexible, with participants practicing on their own time and at their own pace. This suggests a more pragmatic approach, as it mirrors the way patients might adhere to a treatment in a real-world setting.

Score: [4]

7. Follow-up:

Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Assessments were made at baseline, postintervention, and 6 months follow-up.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The follow-up in this trial was fairly standard, with assessments made at baseline, postintervention, and 6 months follow-up. This suggests a balance between explanatory and pragmatic approaches, as it is common to have follow-up assessments in both trial and usual care settings.

Score: [3]

8. Primary outcome:

Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Primary outcomes included disease-specific and disease-aspecific HRQOL, depression, and fatigue.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The primary outcomes in this trial were highly relevant to the participants, including measures of health-related quality of life, depression, and fatigue. This suggests a more pragmatic approach, as these outcomes are likely to be of importance to patients in a real-world setting.

Score: [5]

9. Primary analysis:

Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Intention-to-treat analyses are reported.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The primary analysis in this trial was an intention-to-treat analysis, which includes all participants regardless of whether they completed the intervention. This suggests a more pragmatic approach, as it reflects the reality of treatment adherence in a real-world setting.

1. Eligibility criteria

Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The subjects were eligible for recruiting if they met the following criteria: (1) age > 18 years; (2) established diagnosis of the specific pathological condition MS, stroke or TBI; (3) nine hole peg test (NHPG) performed in more than 25 seconds; (4) ability to move at least one peg in 180 seconds during the NHPG; (5) sufficient autonomous functioning; (6) internet connection or telephone line and reachable internet provider; (7) clinical status stable; (8) discharged from hospital or rehabilitation setting – person lives at home.&quot;</span>
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Exclusions were: a) disturbed upper limb function not related to MS, TBI or stroke; B) serious cognitive and/or behavioral problems; c) serious emotional problems; D) major visual problems; (e) communication problems; F) medical complications; G) other problems possibly contra-indicating autonomous exercise at home.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The eligibility criteria for this trial are quite specific and may not reflect the full range of patients who would receive this intervention in a usual care setting. For example, the requirement for internet connection or telephone line and the exclusion of patients with serious cognitive or emotional problems may limit the generalizability of the trial results. 

Score: [2]

2. Recruitment

Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Patients were recruited from Unità Organica di Riabilitazione Intensiva Neuromotoria (UOrIN, Italy), Foundation Institute Guttmann (FPING, Spain) and from National Multiple Sclerosis Centre (NMSc, Belgium).&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The recruitment process seems to be more explanatory as it involves recruiting patients from specific rehabilitation centers, which may not reflect the diversity of patients in a usual care setting.

Score: [2]

3. Setting

Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;All measurements were performed at the centre where the patient had been treated.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial is conducted in a specific clinical setting (rehabilitation centers), which may not reflect the diversity of settings in which the intervention would be applied in usual care.

Score: [2]

4. Organisation

Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The tele-rehabilitation service is mainly addressed to neurological patients affected by traumatic brain injury (TBI), stroke or multiple sclerosis (MS).&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The organization of the trial seems to be more explanatory as it involves a specific tele-rehabilitation service for neurological patients, which may not reflect the diversity of healthcare organizations in a usual care setting.

Score: [2]

5. Flexibility (delivery)

Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The actual intervention with the H-CAD system at home consisted of one month, whereby the patients had an average of one training session a day lasting 30 minutes for at least 5 days a week.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The delivery of the intervention is quite flexible as it allows patients to perform the training at home. However, the requirement for a specific duration and frequency of training sessions may limit the flexibility.

Score: [4]

6. Flexibility (adherence)

Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The intervention group underwent one month of usual care, followed by approximately 4 training sessions with the H-CAD system in the hospital.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial allows some flexibility in adherence to the intervention, as patients are allowed to undergo a period of usual care before starting the intervention. However, the requirement for a specific number of training sessions may limit the flexibility.

Score: [4]

7. Follow-up

Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The third measurement (T2) was performed after the month of H-CAD intervention for the intervention group and 2 months after baseline for the control group.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The follow-up period seems to be more explanatory as it involves specific time points for measurements, which may not reflect the variability in follow-up periods in a usual care setting.

Score: [2]

8. Primary outcome

Quotes:
- <span title='Moderate quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 82.6%):

lItAtIon clInIcAl trIAl was: is the use of the H-caD system for one month at least as good as usual care for the arm/hand function in stroke, tBI and MS patients?' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ff9e81'>&quot;The main research question in this validation trial was: is the use of the H-CAD system for one month at least as good as usual care for the arm/hand function in stroke, TBI and MS patients?&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The primary outcome of the trial is relevant to participants as it focuses on the improvement of arm/hand function, which is a key concern for patients with stroke, TBI, and MS.

Score: [5]

9. Primary analysis

Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The hypothesis is that the H-CAD system is at least as effective as the usual care for arm/hand function, measured with outcome measures for arm/hand function, given to the stroke, TBI and MS patients when they are living at home.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The primary analysis of the trial is quite pragmatic as it involves an intention-to-treat analysis using all available data, which reflects the variability in patient adherence and response to the intervention in a usual care setting.

3. Reasoning: The eligibility criteria for this trial were quite broad, including anyone with MS who had unresolved symptoms, psychosocial concerns, end-of-life issues, progressive illness, or complex needs. However, patients with very urgent needs or rapidly deteriorating conditions were excluded. This suggests a somewhat pragmatic approach, as the trial aimed to include a wide range of patients who might benefit from the intervention in a real-world setting, but excluded those who might not be able to participate fully in the trial due to their health status.

2. Reasoning: The recruitment process for this trial was fairly pragmatic, as it relied on clinician referrals, which is a common method of recruitment in usual care. However, the full text does not provide detailed information about the recruitment process, such as whether any additional strategies were used to recruit participants.
Score: [4]

Setting:
1. Quote: <span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 98.5%):

PCT. 18,20 This comprised one part-time consultant in palliative medicine, one part-time clinical nurse specialist, one administrator, and one psychosocial worker, and was based in a large teaching hospital.' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;The PCT comprised one part-time consultant in palliative medicine, one part-time clinical nurse specialist, one administrator, and one psychosocial worker, and was based in a large teaching hospital.&quot;</span>
2. Reasoning: The trial was conducted in a large teaching hospital, which may not be representative of all settings where the intervention could be applied. However, the intervention was delivered in patients' homes or sometimes outpatient clinics, nursing homes, or hospital, which suggests a somewhat pragmatic approach.
Score: [3]

Organisation:
1. Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Patients were visited in their own homes or sometimes outpatient clinics, nursing homes, or hospital. The PCT undertook assessments, suggested ways to improve physical, emotional, social, and other problems, provided specialist welfare benefits advice and bereavement support, and liaised with and acted as a catalyst for local services, both primary and specialist teams.&quot;</span>
2. Reasoning: The organisation of the intervention delivery was somewhat pragmatic, as it was integrated into the usual care setting and made use of existing healthcare staff and resources. However, the intervention also involved additional resources, such as specialist welfare benefits advice and bereavement support, which may not be available in all usual care settings.
Score: [4]

Flexibility (delivery):
1. Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;After initial assessment, treatment was recommended.&quot;</span>
2. Reasoning: The intervention was somewhat flexible in its delivery, as the specific treatment recommendations were made after an initial assessment of each patient. However, the full text does not provide detailed information about the extent of this flexibility.
Score: [4]

Flexibility (adherence):
1. Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Patients were randomized to receive a PCT immediately (fast track) or after a 12-week wait (usual best practice, control).&quot;</span>
2. Reasoning: The trial design allowed for some flexibility in adherence to the intervention, as patients in the control group were offered the intervention after a 12-week wait. However, the full text does not provide detailed information about the measures in place to ensure participants adhere to the intervention.
Score: [NA]

Follow-up:
1. Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;We collected outcome and cost data at baseline (before randomization) and at 6, 12, 18 (only control groupdafter they received PCT), and 24 weeks.&quot;</span>
2. Reasoning: The follow-up schedule for this trial was somewhat explanatory, as it involved more frequent follow-up visits than would typically occur under usual care. However, the follow-up visits were necessary for the collection of outcome and cost data.
Score: [2]

Primary outcome:
1. Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;At 12 weeks, caregiver burden was 4.47 points lower (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.05e7.89) in the fast track compared to the control group.&quot;</span>
2. Reasoning: The primary outcome of this trial, caregiver burden, is highly relevant to participants and is likely to be measured in a similar way in usual care. This suggests a pragmatic approach to the choice of primary outcome.
Score: [5]

Primary analysis:
1. Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;We planned an intention-to-treat analysis, irrespective of whether patients were assessed as having palliative care needs or the nature of contact with the PCT.&quot;</span>
2. Reasoning: The primary analysis for this trial was an intention-to-treat analysis, which is a pragmatic approach as it includes all data regardless of adherence to the intervention.

<pre>
1. Eligibility criteria
- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Eligibility criteria for patients: diagnosis RRMS since at least one year, EDSS score �4.0, no symptoms suggestive of a relapse, no relapse in the preceding four weeks, willing and capable of participating in the investigations, and having access to the internet for performing the web-based assessments.&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The eligibility criteria for this trial are quite specific, including a diagnosis of RRMS for at least one year, an EDSS score of 4.0 or less, no symptoms or relapses in the preceding four weeks, and the ability and willingness to participate in the investigations. This suggests that the trial is more explanatory in nature, as it is not including a broad range of patients who might receive the intervention in a usual care setting.
- Score: [2]

2. Recruitment
- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants were recruited from all over the Netherlands by the patient organisation NMSF, Rotterdam, the Netherlands.&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The recruitment process for this trial is somewhat pragmatic, as it involves recruiting patients from all over the Netherlands through a patient organization. However, it does not specify whether this recruitment process mirrors the process that would be used in a usual care setting.
- Score: [4]

3. Setting
- Quote: <span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 97.8%):

CDT was given during three consecutive days in Zorghotel Spelderholt, Beekbergen, the Netherlands, a facility especially equipped for the accommodation of people with impaired health.' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;CDTs were given during three consecutive days in Zorghotel Spelderholt, Beekbergen, the Netherlands, a facility especially equipped for the accommodation of people with impaired health.&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The setting for this trial is a specific facility that is equipped for the accommodation of people with impaired health. This suggests that the trial is more explanatory in nature, as it is not being conducted in a usual care setting.
- Score: [2]

4. Organisation
- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The multidisciplinary team included a psychiatrist, psychiatric nurse, neurologist, registered nurse specialized in MS, physiotherapist, dance therapist, and a person with MS.&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The organization of this trial involves a multidisciplinary team of professionals, including a psychiatrist, psychiatric nurse, neurologist, registered nurse specialized in MS, physiotherapist, dance therapist, and a person with MS. This suggests that the trial is more explanatory in nature, as it requires a high level of expertise and resources that may not be available in a usual care setting.
- Score: [2]

5. Flexibility (delivery)
- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;CDT’s components are large group sessions, small group sessions, consultations (carrousel), a theatre evening, and start of the day with a joint activity (optional).&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The delivery of the intervention in this trial is quite structured, with specific components including large group sessions, small group sessions, consultations, a theatre evening, and an optional joint activity at the start of the day. This suggests that the trial is more explanatory in nature, as it does not allow for much flexibility in how the intervention is delivered.
- Score: [2]

6. Flexibility (adherence)
- Quote: <span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 99.2%):

The intervention was delivered as planned in all patients except for two (2.5%) patients, who discontinued CDT prematurely' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;The intervention was delivered as planned in all patients except for two (2.5%) patients, who discontinued CDT prematurely.&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The adherence to the intervention in this trial appears to be quite high, with only two patients discontinuing the intervention prematurely. However, the full text does not provide enough information to assess the flexibility of adherence in this trial.
- Score: [NA]

7. Follow-up
- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Assessments were at baseline and at one, three and six months follow-up via online questionnaires.&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The follow-up in this trial is quite structured, with assessments conducted at baseline and at one, three, and six months via online questionnaires. This suggests that the trial is more explanatory in nature, as it does not allow for much flexibility in the follow-up process.
- Score: [2]

8. Primary outcome
- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The primary study outcome was the change in control self-efficacy, assessed by the Multiple Sclerosis Self-Efficacy Scale (MSSES), at six months.&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The primary outcome of this trial is the change in control self-efficacy, which is assessed by the Multiple Sclerosis Self-Efficacy Scale. This outcome is relevant to patients and is likely to be measured in a similar way in a usual care setting, suggesting that the trial is more pragmatic in nature.
- Score: [4]

9. Primary analysis
- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;All endpoints were analyzed according to the intention-to-treat principle using an ANCOVA with the 6-month value as dependent variable, and condition, baseline value, disease duration and gender as independent variables.&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The primary analysis of this trial involves an intention-to-treat analysis using an ANCOVA, with the 6-month value as the dependent variable and condition, baseline value, disease duration, and gender as independent variables. This suggests that the trial is more pragmatic in nature, as it includes all data in the analysis.

Inclusion criteria were: 1) having a definite diagnosis of MS from a neurologist; 2) being within 5 years of receiving a diagnosis of MS; 3) scoring at least 10 on the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) [26]; 4) not currently undertaking other psychological treatment for depressive or anxiety symptoms for the length of participation in the current trial; 5) speak English fluently; 6) no current or lifetime diagnosis of psychosis; 7) no current substance dependency; 8) no gross cognitive impairment; and 9) no changes to medications prior and during involvement in the trial.' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;Inclusion criteria were: 1) having a definite diagnosis of MS from a neurologist; 2) being within 5 years of receiving a diagnosis of MS; 3) scoring at least 10 on the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) [26]; 4) not currently undertaking other psychological treatment for depressive symptoms or anxiety for the length of participation in the current trial; 5) speak English fluently; 6) no current or lifetime diagnosis of psychosis; 7) no current substance dependency; 8) no gross cognitive impairment; and 9) no changes to medications prior and during involvement in the trial.&quot;</span>
The eligibility criteria for this trial are quite specific, excluding those with psychosis, substance dependency, gross cognitive impairment, and those currently undergoing other psychological treatments. This suggests that the trial is more explanatory in nature, as it is not including all individuals who might receive the intervention in a usual care setting. Score: [2]

Recruitment:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants were recruited through neurologists working in a large MS outpatient clinic at the hospital, advertisements on MS related websites and local press releases.&quot;</span>
The recruitment process involved both usual care settings (through neurologists at the hospital) and additional strategies (advertisements on websites and press releases). This suggests a somewhat pragmatic approach, but the use of additional recruitment strategies outside of usual care settings reduces the score. Score: [3]

Setting:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The study took place at a large teaching and research hospital in Melbourne, Australia.&quot;</span>
The trial was conducted in a hospital setting, which may not be identical to all settings where the results are intended to be applied (e.g., community clinics, primary care settings). Therefore, the setting is somewhat explanatory. Score: [2]

Organisation:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;A senior clinical psychologist and a provisional clinical psychologist (supervised by the clinical psychologist) provided the intervention.&quot;</span>
The intervention was delivered by specialized healthcare professionals (clinical psychologists), which may not be available in all usual care settings. This suggests a more explanatory approach. Score: [2]

Flexibility (delivery):
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The tailored early intervention is appropriate and clinically effective for the treatment of depressive symptoms in those newly diagnosed with MS.&quot;</span>
The intervention appears to be delivered in a standardized manner, suggesting a more explanatory approach. However, the full text does not provide enough information to fully assess this domain. Score: [NA]

Flexibility (adherence):
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;All participants in the CBT intervention reported reading and completing all of the materials provided for homework and reported that the intervention was ‘very useful’.&quot;</span>
The trial seems to require adherence to the intervention (reading and completing all materials), suggesting a more explanatory approach. However, the full text does not provide enough information to fully assess this domain. Score: [NA]

Follow-up:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;All participants completed the pre, post and 20 week follow up questionnaires.&quot;</span>
The follow-up in this trial appears to be more intense than what would typically occur in usual care, suggesting a more explanatory approach. Score: [2]

Primary outcome:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The primary outcome was level of depressive symptoms using the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II).&quot;</span>
The primary outcome (level of depressive symptoms) is clearly relevant to participants and is likely to be measured in a similar way in usual care, suggesting a pragmatic approach. Score: [5]

1. Eligibility criteria

Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants had a confirmed diagnosis of multiple sclerosis, an Extended Disability Status Scale score of 5 (ambulatory without aid or rest for about 200 m) to 6.5 (constant bilateral assistance required to walk about 20 m without resting), stable rehabilitation and drug therapy for 30 days before entry into the study, cognitive scores of over 24 on the Mini-Mental State Examination and access to the intervention sites using their own or public transport.&quot;</span>
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Potential participants were excluded if they had experienced exacerbation of their multiple sclerosis symptoms three months prior to the study, or had any medical condition which may preclude them from taking part in the exercise intervention.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The eligibility criteria for this trial are quite specific, including a confirmed diagnosis of multiple sclerosis, a certain range of disability scores, stable rehabilitation and drug therapy, cognitive scores above a certain threshold, and access to the intervention sites. This suggests that the trial is not including all potential candidates for the intervention, but rather a subset of individuals who meet these criteria. Therefore, the trial is more explanatory in nature.

Score: [2]

2. Recruitment

Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Of the 873 patients on the clinical register for multiple sclerosis 159 patients were deemed suitable for the study. These people were sent invitation letters and participant information sheets.&quot;</span>
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Thus 32 people with multiple sclerosis, 23 female and nine male, participated in the study.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The recruitment process involved identifying suitable patients from a clinical register and sending them invitation letters and information sheets. This suggests a more explanatory approach, as it involves an active recruitment process rather than simply including all individuals who present at a clinic with the condition of interest.

Score: [2]

3. Setting

Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The intervention took place at two different geographical locations (Site A and Site B).&quot;</span>
- <span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 98.9%):

Reasoning: The trial was conducted in two community leisure settings, which suggests a more pragmatic approach as it reflects a real-world setting where the intervention might be implemented. However, the fact that the trial was conducted in only two locations may limit the generalizability of the results to other settings.

Score: [4]

4. Organisation

Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Each group was led by two instructors (one physiotherapist and one fitness instructor). The same physiotherapist was present at both sites; however fitness instructors were different between sites.&quot;</span>
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants were provided with exercise progress cards and were asked to record which level they performed each exercise at each session.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial required specific resources, including two instructors (a physiotherapist and a fitness instructor) for each group, and exercise progress cards for participants to record their performance. This suggests a more explanatory approach, as it involves a level of organization and resources that may not be available in usual care.

Score: [2]

5. Flexibility (delivery)

Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The group session involved a 10-minute warm-up of aerobic and stretching components, 30–40 minutes of circuit exercises (Appendix 1 on-line), designed to train aerobic endurance, resistance and balance, and a 5–10 minute cool-down, involving aerobic work, stretching and relaxation.&quot;</span>
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Through discussion with the instructors, participants chose which level of each exercise they deemed appropriate and also when and how each exercise should be progressed.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The intervention was delivered in a structured format, with specific components and durations for each part of the session. However, participants had some flexibility in choosing the level of each exercise and when to progress, suggesting a balance between explanatory and pragmatic approaches.

Score: [3]

6. Flexibility (adherence)

Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Attendance of participants at each class was recorded.&quot;</span>
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Including those who discontinued participation, the total attendance at the classes was 340 sessions out of a possible 480 (71%)&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial monitored participants' adherence to the intervention by recording attendance at each class. However, there were no specific measures in place to ensure adherence, suggesting a more pragmatic approach.

Score: [4]

7. Follow-up

Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Outcome measures were carried out within the local hospital’s rehabilitation unit. They were taken at baseline, after 8 and 12 weeks of the intervention period (i.e. either the exercise class or usual care).&quot;</span>
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;At week 8 three participants discontinued participation, with missing data for one other. At week 12 one other participant discontinued participation, with missing data for three other participants.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial involved follow-up assessments at specific time points (8 and 12 weeks), and there were instances of missing data due to participants discontinuing participation. This suggests a more explanatory approach, as it involves a level of follow-up that may not be typical in usual care.

Score: [2]

8. Primary outcome

Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The primary outcome measure was 25-foot (7.6 m) walk time, secondary outcomes assessed walking endurance, balance, physical function, leg strength, body mass index, activity levels, fatigue, anxiety and depression, quality of life and goal attainment.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The primary outcome of the trial, the 25-foot walk time, is a measure that is directly relevant to participants and reflects a real-world outcome of interest. This suggests a more pragmatic approach.

Score: [5]

9. Primary analysis

Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;All outcome measures were analysed on the basis of intention to treat, with all variables summarized and comparisons made between groups and over time.&quot;</span>
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Data were analysed using a univariate general linear model analysis of variance (ANOVA) which allowed for missing data, possible differences over time (baseline, week 8 and week 12) and possible differences between groups (intervention and control) to be assessed.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial used an intention-to-treat analysis, which includes all participants regardless of their adherence to the intervention. This approach is more pragmatic, as it reflects the reality that not all individuals will adhere to an intervention in usual care.

<p><i><span style="border-bottom: 1px dashed black;">9 quote(s) from
publication full text</span> (mean similarity 97.1%)</i></p>
<pre>
1. Eligibility criteria
- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The target population was community dwelling individuals aged 19 to 65 who have been diagnosed after 1994 with multiple sclerosis. Specific inclusion criteria were (1) ambulatory (can walk 100 m, be capable of walking 100 metres without a walking aid corresponding to a classification of ⩽5.5 on the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS), even if they do use an aid for daily activities; and (2) self-reported to be sedentary or irregularly active at time of study entry (i.e. do not exercise 30 minutes or more twice per week of moderate to vigorous activity).&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The eligibility criteria for this trial are quite specific, including age, diagnosis date, ambulatory status, and current exercise habits. This suggests that the trial is not fully representative of all individuals with multiple sclerosis, but rather a subset of this population who are ambulatory and currently sedentary or irregularly active. This specificity in the eligibility criteria leans towards an explanatory trial design.
- Score: [2]

2. Recruitment
- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;People were recruited from four multiple sclerosis clinics in three Canadian cities and from posting on media sites.&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The recruitment strategy involved both clinic recruitment and media postings, suggesting an effort to reach a broader population than just those attending the clinics. However, the use of media postings is not a usual care recruitment strategy, which leans towards an explanatory approach.
- Score: [3]

3. Setting
- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The trial received ethical approval from the Montreal Neurological Hospital Research Ethics Board (NEU-12-005) and the Health Research Ethics Board, University of Manitoba (H2014:226) Recruitment commenced in March 2013 and the date of the last 12 month visit was March 2016.&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The trial was conducted in multiple sclerosis clinics in three Canadian cities, which suggests a setting that is representative of usual care for individuals with multiple sclerosis in these areas. This leans towards a pragmatic approach.
- Score: [4]

4. Organisation
- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants in both groups received two private training sessions with the physical therapist or exercise therapist.&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The intervention required additional resources beyond usual care, including private training sessions with a physical therapist or exercise therapist. This suggests a more explanatory approach as it involves resources and expertise beyond what is typically available in usual care.
- Score: [2]

5. Flexibility (delivery)
- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;MSTEP©, a personally adapted exercise regimen done on most days including two days of high intensity exercise; guidelines recommending 30 minutes of moderate intensity aerobic and strength training two times per week.&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The intervention was flexible in that it was personally adapted for each participant, but it also had specific requirements for frequency and intensity of exercise. This suggests a balance between pragmatic and explanatory approaches.
- Score: [3]

6. Flexibility (adherence)
- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;All participants were contacted every two weeks during the first two months, then monthly thereafter by the exercise instructor by telephone or email for follow-up by the instructor.&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The trial protocol included measures to monitor and encourage participant adherence to the intervention, which is not typically part of usual care. This leans towards an explanatory approach.
- Score: [2]

7. Follow-up
- Quote: <span title='Major quote deviation, possible hallucination. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 73.8%):

The intention was to follow participants for the first year of the intervention when the exercise programme was designed and adjusted as needed' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: red'>&quot;The intention was to follow participants for the first year of the intervention when the exercise programme was designed and adjusted as needed and have a further follow-up after the second year.&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The follow-up period was longer than what would typically occur in usual care, suggesting a more explanatory approach. However, the follow-up was designed to monitor the effectiveness of the intervention over a realistic timeframe, which leans towards a pragmatic approach.
- Score: [3]

8. Primary outcome
- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Primary outcome was peak oxygen consumption (VO2peak) at 12 months; secondary outcomes were composite measures of physical function, fatigue, and health-related quality of life.&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The primary outcome of peak oxygen consumption is a physiological measure that may not be directly relevant to the participants' daily lives, suggesting an explanatory approach. However, the secondary outcomes are more patient-centered and relevant to usual care, which leans towards a pragmatic approach.
- Score: [3]

9. Primary analysis
- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The primary analysis was of the proportion of people making an absolute improvement at the final time point, 12 months.&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The primary analysis included all participants who had data at the 12-month time point, suggesting an intention-to-treat approach which is characteristic of a pragmatic trial design.

2. Reasoning: The trial has specific eligibility criteria, including a definite diagnosis of primary or secondary progressive MS and a specific range of EDSS scores. This suggests that the trial is not including all patients who might receive the intervention in a usual care setting, but rather a specific subset of patients with moderate to severe MS. This makes the trial more explanatory in nature.
3. Score: [2]

Recruitment:
1. Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;People moderately to severely affected by MS were recruited from the MS Service, NHS Ayrshire and Arran.&quot;</span>
2. Reasoning: The trial recruited participants from a specific MS service, which suggests that the recruitment process may not reflect the way patients would be engaged with in a usual care setting. This makes the trial more explanatory in nature.
3. Score: [2]

Setting:
1. Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Subjects in both groups were assessed at the beginning and at the end of the eight-week intervention period (i.e. either physiotherapy or control) and then again eight weeks later.&quot;</span>
2. Reasoning: The trial was conducted in the participants' homes, which is a setting that closely matches the usual care setting for these patients. This makes the trial more pragmatic in nature.

Organisation:
1. Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Subjects assigned to Group 1 received physiotherapy, twice weekly for eight weeks, by an experienced domiciliary physiotherapist within their home.&quot;</span>
2. Reasoning: The trial required an experienced domiciliary physiotherapist to deliver the intervention at the participants' homes twice weekly for eight weeks. This level of organisation and resource allocation may not be reflective of usual care, making the trial more explanatory in nature.

Flexibility (delivery):
1. Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Each session lasted up to 60 minutes, and a task-specific programme included upper and lower limb strengthening using theraband, mobile pedals, and weights.&quot;</span>
2. Reasoning: The intervention was delivered in a highly structured and specific manner, with little flexibility in how it was delivered. This makes the trial more explanatory in nature.

1. Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The MS impact scale (MSIS 29), which is a measure of the physical and psychological impact of MS, was the primary outcome measure for the study.&quot;</span>
2. Reasoning: The primary outcome of the trial is relevant to participants and is likely to be measured in a similar way in usual care, making the trial more pragmatic in nature.

Primary analysis:
1. Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Outcome variables that could be shown to be analysed using parametric procedures (e.g. FIM), were analysed using a two-factor repeated measures ANOVA with the two factors being time (0, 8 and 16) and group (1,2), thus allowing for possible interaction effects to assess whether groups react differently over time.&quot;</span>
2. Reasoning: The trial used an intention-to-treat analysis using all available data, which is a pragmatic approach to the analysis.

1. Eligibility criteria

Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Two hundred and seventy-eight people with MS were invited to take part in the study. One hundred and eighty-nine people consented to take part (68%).&quot;</span>
- <span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 98.5%):

The only selection criterion was that the diagnosis of MS was con rmed by the general practitioner. There were no exclusion criteria.' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;The only selection criterion was that the diagnosis of MS was confirmed by the general practitioner. There were no exclusion criteria.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial included anyone with a confirmed diagnosis of MS, without any exclusion criteria. This suggests a highly pragmatic approach, as it reflects the real-world population of people with MS who might receive the intervention.

Score: [5]

2. Recruitment

Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants were volunteers with MS who were recruited through voluntary organizations, were community based and lived in West London and in counties contiguous with Greater London.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The recruitment process involved reaching out to potential participants through voluntary organizations, which may not reflect the usual care setting. However, the recruitment was community-based, which adds a pragmatic element.

Score: [4]

3. Setting

Quotes:

1. Eligibility criteria

Quotes:
- <span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 98.4%):

2012. Inclusion criteria were: having MS (MacDonald criteria); being able to complete a questionnaire; and being in need for a multidisciplinary approach, defined by the requirement, in addition to the neurology specialist, of at least two different medical (rehabilitation specialist, neurourology specialist, psychiatrist) or allied health professionals (physiotherapist, occupational therapist, social worker, psychologist, and neuropsycholo' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;Inclusion criteria were: having MS (MacDonald criteria); being able to complete a questionnaire; and being in need for a multidisciplinary approach, defined by the requirement, in addition to the neurology specialist, of at least two different medical (rehabilitation specialist, neuro-urology specialist, psychiatrist) or allied health professionals (physiotherapist, occupational therapist, social worker, psychologist, and neuropsychologist).&quot;</span>
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Patients who were not living independently in the community were excluded.&quot;</span>

Reasoning:
The eligibility criteria for this trial are quite specific, requiring patients to have MS, be able to complete a questionnaire, and be in need of a multidisciplinary approach. This suggests that the trial is not including all patients who might receive the intervention in a usual care setting, but rather a specific subset of patients who meet these criteria. This leans towards an explanatory approach.

Score: [2]

2. Recruitment

Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;MS patients from the outpatient clinic of the Neurology Department of Pitie´-Salpeˆtrie`re Hospital were prospectively enrolled in the study between March 2010 and July 2012.&quot;</span>

Reasoning:
The recruitment process for this trial involved enrolling patients from a specific outpatient clinic, which suggests that the trial may not be representative of all patients who might receive the intervention in a usual care setting. This leans towards an explanatory approach.

Score: [2]

3. Setting

Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;This is a prospective, randomized, controlled, monocentric clinical trial in MS patients.&quot;</span>

Reasoning:
The trial is conducted in a single center, which suggests that the setting may not be representative of all settings where the intervention might be applied in usual care. This leans towards an explanatory approach.

Score: [2]

4. Organisation

Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Two treatment strategies were compared: (i) an integrated multidisciplinary (IMD) approach, consisting of a half-day individually tailored comprehensive assessment in the MS clinic; and (ii) a standard care.&quot;</span>

Reasoning:
The trial involves comparing an integrated multidisciplinary approach with standard care, suggesting that the organization of care delivery in the trial may not be the same as in usual care. This leans towards an explanatory approach.

Score: [2]

5. Flexibility (delivery)

Quotes:

Reasoning:
The delivery of the intervention in this trial is quite structured, with a specific timeline for the integrated multidisciplinary approach. This suggests that there may be less flexibility in the delivery of the intervention than in usual care, leaning towards an explanatory approach.

Score: [2]

6. Flexibility (adherence)

Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;In most cases the same health professionals were in charge of the two groups.&quot;</span>

Reasoning:
The trial does not appear to have specific measures in place to ensure participants adhere to the intervention, suggesting a more pragmatic approach in this domain.

Score: [4]

7. Follow-up

Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Primary and secondary outcomes were assessed at inclusion, and after six (M6) and 12 (M12) months.&quot;</span>

Reasoning:
The follow-up in this trial involves specific time points for assessing outcomes, which may be more structured than follow-up in usual care. This leans towards an explanatory approach.

Score: [2]

8. Primary outcome

Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The primary outcome was the impact of the strategy on quality of life (QoL) measured using the MSIS-29 scale at inclusion and after six months.&quot;</span>

Reasoning:
The primary outcome of this trial is quality of life, which is a patient-relevant outcome. This suggests a more pragmatic approach in this domain.

Score: [5]

9. Primary analysis

Quotes:
- <span title='Moderate quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 93.7%):

<pre>
1. Eligibility criteria

Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;To be included in the study participants were required to have a confirmed diagnosis of MS, an Expanded Disability Status Score of between 5 and 6.5, stable drug therapy for 30 days, no relapses in the previous three months, no significant co-morbidities such as coexisting cardiac or pulmonary condition and have access to the internet via personal or tablet computer.&quot;</span>
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Thirty community dwelling adults moderately affected by MS (Expanded Disability Status Scale 5-6.5).&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The eligibility criteria for this trial are quite specific, including a confirmed diagnosis of MS, a specific range on the Expanded Disability Status Score, stable drug therapy, no recent relapses, no significant co-morbidities, and access to the internet. This suggests that the trial is not including a broad range of patients who might be affected by MS in the real world, but rather a more specific subset of patients who meet these criteria. 

Score: [2]

2. Recruitment

Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Letters were sent to 138 patients from the Multiple Sclerosis Service database, thought to be suitable for the study, inviting them to participate.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The recruitment process involved sending letters to potential participants who were identified from a database. This suggests that the recruitment process was not entirely naturalistic and required some additional effort beyond what would occur in usual care. 

Score: [3]

3. Setting

Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Setting: Rehabilitation centre and participants’ homes.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial was conducted in a rehabilitation center and in participants' homes. This suggests that the setting of the trial is somewhat similar to the settings where the intervention might be applied in usual care, although it is not clear how representative these settings are of the full range of settings where the intervention might be used.

Score: [4]

4. Organisation

Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Twelve weeks of individualised web-based physiotherapy completed twice per week or usual care (control). Online exercise diaries were monitored; participants were telephoned weekly by the physiotherapist and exercise programmes altered remotely by the physiotherapist as required.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The organisation of the trial involved individualised web-based physiotherapy, with monitoring of online exercise diaries and weekly telephone calls from the physiotherapist. This suggests that the trial required some additional resources and expertise beyond what would be available in usual care.

Score: [3]

5. Flexibility (delivery)

Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Individualised therapeutic exercise programmes were developed for participants in Group 1, with exercises selected based on their baseline assessment and personal goals.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The intervention was delivered in a flexible manner, with individualised exercise programmes developed for each participant based on their baseline assessment and personal goals. This suggests a high degree of flexibility in the delivery of the intervention.

Score: [5]

6. Flexibility (adherence)

Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants were advised to undertake the exercise programme a minimum of twice a week and to complete their online exercise diary which was seen remotely by the physiotherapist.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial protocol required participants to adhere to the exercise programme a minimum of twice a week and to complete an online exercise diary. This suggests some degree of flexibility in adherence, although the requirement to complete the exercise programme and diary may be more stringent than what would be expected in usual care.

Score: [4]

7. Follow-up

Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Outcome measures were recorded at baseline and at the end of the intervention period (week 13).&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The follow-up in this trial involved recording outcome measures at baseline and at the end of the intervention period. This suggests a relatively straightforward follow-up process, although it is not clear how this compares to the follow-up that would occur in usual care.

Score: [4]

8. Primary outcome

Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The primary outcome measure, the timed 25ft walk, has good reliability and validity in the MS population.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The primary outcome measure in this trial was the timed 25ft walk, which is a measure that is likely to be relevant to participants and is commonly used in clinical practice. This suggests a high degree of pragmatism in the choice of primary outcome.

Score: [5]

9. Primary analysis

Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;For all outcome variables mean, standard deviation, mean difference and 95% confidence intervals and estimate of Cohen’s d effect size are reported.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The primary analysis in this trial involved calculating means, standard deviations, mean differences, confidence intervals, and effect sizes for all outcome variables. This suggests a standard approach to data analysis that is likely to be applicable in usual care.

- Quote 2: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The patients were randomised to home (intervention) or hospital care (control) in a ratio of 2:1, in order to ensure that the home care population was sufficiently represented.&quot;</span>
The eligibility criteria for this trial were quite broad, including anyone with clinically definite multiple sclerosis living in the Rome service area. However, the trial did not explicitly mention including patients with a range of comorbidities or different age groups, which might be seen in a usual care setting. Therefore, the trial's eligibility criteria are somewhat pragmatic but not fully so.
Score: [3]

Recruitment:
- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Patients were recruited from the multiple sclerosis centre of the neurological department of La Sapienza University, or from other institutional centres for multiple sclerosis in Rome.&quot;</span>
The recruitment process for this trial was conducted through multiple sclerosis centres, which is a somewhat pragmatic approach as it mirrors the usual care setting where patients would typically be identified. However, the trial did not mention any additional recruitment strategies that might be used in a usual care setting, such as media advertising campaigns or incentives.
Score: [4]

Setting:
- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The study was conducted in Rome and was approved by the ethics committee of La Sapienza University.&quot;</span>
The trial was conducted in Rome, which is the same setting where the results are likely to be applied. This is a highly pragmatic approach as it closely matches the usual care setting.
Score: [5]

Organisation:
- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The home based care multidisciplinary team included two neurologists, a urologist, a rehabilitation physician, a psychologist, a physical therapist, a nurse, a social worker, and a coordinator.&quot;</span>
The organisation of the trial intervention involved a multidisciplinary team, which is a somewhat pragmatic approach as it mirrors the usual organisation of care for multiple sclerosis. However, the trial did not mention whether this team was provided with additional resources or training beyond what would be available in a usual care setting.
Score: [4]

Flexibility (delivery):
- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Based on individual needs, patients randomised to home based care were followed through home visits and telephone follow up.&quot;</span>
The trial allowed for flexibility in the delivery of the intervention, with care being tailored to individual patient needs and delivered through home visits and telephone follow up. This is a highly pragmatic approach as it closely mirrors the flexibility of care delivery in a usual care setting.
Score: [5]

Flexibility (adherence):
- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;A dedicated phone number was available five days a week from 9 am to 5 pm, where an operator addressed questions or concerns from patients and caregivers and contacted the different specialists according to the specific requirement.&quot;</span>
The trial allowed for flexibility in patient adherence to the intervention, with a dedicated phone line available for patients and caregivers to address questions or concerns. This is a highly pragmatic approach as it closely mirrors the flexibility of patient adherence in a usual care setting.

- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;At the end of a one year follow up period, all patients underwent the same comprehensive interview as at baseline.&quot;</span>
The follow-up in this trial was conducted at the end of a one-year period, with all patients undergoing the same comprehensive interview. This is a somewhat pragmatic approach as it mirrors the usual care setting where patients would typically be followed up at regular intervals. However, the trial did not mention whether the follow-up was more intense than what would typically occur in a usual care setting.
Score: [4]

Primary outcome:
- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Our objective in this randomised controlled trial was to compare health outcomes and cost-effectiveness between home based care and traditional hospital care delivered in a multiple sclerosis centre.&quot;</span>
The primary outcome of this trial was to compare health outcomes and cost-effectiveness between home-based care and traditional hospital care, which is a highly pragmatic approach as it is of obvious importance to patients, healthcare professionals, and policymakers.
Score: [5]

Primary analysis:
- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;For each scale of the SF-36 and separately for the case and control group, we adopted a regression model in which score changes at the end of the follow up period were adjusted for the baseline values.&quot;</span>
The primary analysis of this trial involved using a regression model to adjust score changes at the end of the follow-up period for baseline values. This is a somewhat explanatory approach as it involves a more complex analysis method than would typically be used in a usual care setting.

<pre>
1. Eligibility criteria
- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Subjects: Eighty-five treatment-naïve people with Multiple Sclerosis with persistent (>three months) foot drop.&quot;</span>
- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants were excluded if they had previously used functional electrical stimulation or an ankle-foot orthosis for foot drop, moderate to severe cognitive impairment (scored < 26, Montreal Cognitive Assessment), foot drop due to other disorders, other conditions significantly affecting gait, contraindications to functional electrical stimulation, marked proximal weakness, plantar flexor spasticity, stance phase instability or severe lower limb/trunk ataxia affecting gait.&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The eligibility criteria for this trial are quite specific, excluding people who have previously used the interventions being tested, those with cognitive impairment, and those with other conditions affecting gait. This suggests that the trial is aiming to test the interventions in a relatively homogeneous group of patients with Multiple Sclerosis and foot drop, which is more characteristic of an explanatory trial. 
- Score: [2]

2. Recruitment
- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Potential participants known to Multiple Sclerosis healthcare practitioners working across seven outpatient centres in Scotland – Ayrshire & Arran, Greater Glasgow & Clyde, Dumfries and Galloway, Lanarkshire, Lothian, Fife and Tayside – were informed of the study and issued with a participant information sheet. Potential participants contacted the researchers if they were interested in participating.&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The recruitment process involved healthcare practitioners informing potential participants about the study, who then contacted the researchers if interested. This approach is somewhat pragmatic as it mimics the way patients might learn about new treatments in a usual care setting. However, the fact that the study was conducted across seven outpatient centres in Scotland suggests a level of organization and resources beyond what might be expected in usual care.
- Score: [3]

3. Setting
- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Seven Multiple Sclerosis outpatient centres across Scotland.&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The trial was conducted in multiple outpatient centres across Scotland, which suggests a pragmatic approach to the setting. This is likely to increase the generalizability of the trial results to other outpatient settings where patients with Multiple Sclerosis are treated.
- Score: [4]

4. Organisation
- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants randomized to the usual care group were fitted with a custom-made, solid, ankle-foot orthosis by an orthotist, within four weeks of their initial assessment.&quot;</span> 
- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants randomized to the functional electrical stimulation group were assessed and fitted with an Odstock Dropped Foot Stimulator Pace (OML, Salisbury) device by a physiotherapist experienced in functional electrical stimulation (A.L.).&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The organisation of the trial required specific expertise and resources, including orthotists to fit the ankle-foot orthoses and experienced physiotherapists to fit the functional electrical stimulation devices. This suggests a more explanatory approach to the organisation domain.
- Score: [2]

5. Flexibility (delivery)
- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants in both groups were instructed to gradually increase the wear of their devices over the first six weeks.&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The protocol for the delivery of the interventions was somewhat flexible, with participants instructed to gradually increase the wear of their devices over time. However, the fact that the devices had to be fitted by healthcare professionals suggests a level of rigidity in the delivery of the interventions.
- Score: [3]

6. Flexibility (adherence)
- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants in both groups were instructed to gradually increase the wear of their devices over the first six weeks.&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The protocol allowed for some flexibility in how participants adhered to the interventions, with instructions to gradually increase the wear of their devices over time. However, the fact that the devices had to be fitted by healthcare professionals suggests a level of rigidity in the adherence to the interventions.
- Score: [3]

7. Follow-up
- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Outcome measures were administered by two unblinded assessors (Rebecca Hunter and A.L.) at baseline (0), 3, 6 and 12 months, except for the Psychological Impact of Assistive Devices Score which was administered at 12 months only.&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The follow-up schedule in this trial was quite structured, with assessments conducted at specific time points over a 12-month period. This suggests a more explanatory approach to the follow-up domain.
- Score: [2]

8. Primary outcome
- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The primary outcome was walking speed as measured by the 5-minute self-selected walk test.&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The primary outcome of walking speed is likely to be highly relevant to participants, as it directly measures their ability to walk, which is a key aspect of their daily functioning. This suggests a pragmatic approach to the primary outcome domain.
- Score: [5]

9. Primary analysis
- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;A repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) model was employed to analyse the outcome variables where the main factors, Group (ankle-foot orthoses/functional electrical stimulation), Time (Baseline (0), 3, 6, 12 months) and for the speed and oxygen cost of walking measures, the Condition (with/without device) and their interactions were applied.&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The primary analysis included all available data and used a statistical model that accounted for the repeated measures design of the trial. This suggests a pragmatic approach to the primary analysis domain.

1. Eligibility criteria:

Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants were non-institutionalized adults (age ⩾ 18 years) with severe MS and their primary carers.&quot;</span>
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Other patient inclusion criteria were primary or secondary progressive MS, Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score ⩾ 8.0, complex symptoms, and ⩾2 unmet care needs.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial includes adults with severe MS and their primary carers, which is a specific group of people. The inclusion criteria are quite specific, including a certain level of disability and unmet care needs. This suggests that the trial is not fully pragmatic in its approach to eligibility.

Score: [2]

2. Recruitment:

Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Dyads were randomly assigned (2:1) to receive HPA or UC.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The text does not provide specific details on how participants were recruited into the trial. Therefore, it is not possible to assess the pragmatism of the recruitment process.

Score: [NA]

3. Setting:

Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;In this randomized, examiner-blind, controlled study, we recruited patients from three Italian centers.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial was conducted in three Italian centers, which suggests a certain level of pragmatism as it includes multiple settings. However, the text does not provide enough information to fully assess the pragmatism of the setting.

Score: [NA]

4. Organisation:

Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;At each center, a multi-professional team delivered the 6-month intervention.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The intervention was delivered by a multi-professional team at each center, which suggests a certain level of pragmatism as it reflects the usual care organization. However, the text does not provide enough information to fully assess the pragmatism of the organization.

Score: [NA]

5. Flexibility (delivery):

Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;After a comprehensive assessment of the dyad needs based on direct observation and on visit 1 information (available via the eCRF), the HPA team defined the contents of the intervention, involving the dyad and the patient caring physician (the intervention was not intended to replace existing services).&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The intervention was tailored to the needs of each dyad, which suggests a high level of flexibility in delivery. This is a pragmatic approach as it reflects the individualized care provided in usual practice.

Score: [5]

6. Flexibility (adherence):

Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The team was not on call for dyads: in the event of emergencies, dyads contacted the patient caring physician or emergency medical services.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The text does not provide specific details on how adherence to the intervention was managed. Therefore, it is not possible to assess the pragmatism of flexibility in adherence.

Score: [NA]

7. Follow-up:

Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;A blind examiner assessed dyads at baseline, 3 months, and 6 months.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The follow-up schedule is quite structured, with assessments at specific time points. This suggests a more explanatory approach as it does not reflect the variability in follow-up that might occur in usual care.

Score: [2]

8. Primary outcome:

Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Primary outcome measures were Palliative care Outcome Scale-Symptoms-MS (POS-S-MS) and Schedule for the Evaluation of Individual Quality of Life-Direct Weighting (SEIQoL-DW, not assessed in severely cognitively compromised patients).&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The primary outcomes are relevant to the participants and reflect their symptoms and quality of life. This suggests a pragmatic approach as these outcomes are likely to be important in usual care.

Score: [5]

9. Primary analysis:

Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;All randomly assigned patients were included in the main intention-to-treat analysis, provided that at least one contact with the team occurred (HPA group).&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The intention-to-treat analysis includes all randomly assigned patients, which is a pragmatic approach as it reflects the variability in adherence that might occur in usual care.

Eligibility criteria:
- Quote 1: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The main inclusion criteria were: (1) clinically definite MS diagnosis, (2) fatigue impacting on daily life (Fatigue Severity Scale total score >4) and (3) ambulatory. The main exclusion criteria were: (1) having taken part in a fatigue programme in the last year, (2) cognitive impairments, (3) a relapse in the previous 3 months or (4) having started treatment with disease modifying or antidepressant drugs within the previous 3 months.&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The eligibility criteria for this trial are quite specific and exclude a number of potential participants, such as those with cognitive impairments or those who have recently started certain treatments. This suggests that the trial is more explanatory in nature, as it is not including all potential candidates for the intervention.

- Quote 1: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants were recruited in three UK centres (Poole, Bristol, Southampton/Portsmouth) from primary or secondary care, or via MS Society newsletters/websites.&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The recruitment process for this trial is somewhat pragmatic, as it includes multiple centers and uses both healthcare settings and newsletters/websites for recruitment. However, it does not specify if these methods are typical of usual care.
- Score: [4]

Setting:
- Quote 1: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;FACETS was delivered in hotel meeting-room facilities, with the exception of one centre, where it was held in a rehabilitation hospital.&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The setting for this trial is not typical of usual care, as the intervention was delivered in hotel meeting rooms and a rehabilitation hospital. This suggests a more explanatory approach.
- Score: [2]

Organisation:
- Quote 1: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Facilitators were all qualified to a senior/advanced level (in the UK minimum of a Band 7 on the NHS Agenda for Change (AfC) grading structure).&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The organisation of this trial requires facilitators with a high level of expertise, which may not be available in usual care settings. This suggests a more explanatory approach.

<pre>
**Eligibility criteria**

Quotes: 
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Inclusion criteria for the study included (1) a diagnosis of MS, (2) not currently engaged in rehabilitation, therapy or PA program and able to undertake PA without risk-factors (3) aged between 18 and 65 (4) able to give informed consent and to understand French.&quot;</span>
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;We excluded those who were receiving drug treatment for fatigue started less than three months ago or acute hospital or nursing home, those who were having psychiatric disorders.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The eligibility criteria for this trial are quite specific, excluding those who are currently engaged in rehabilitation or therapy, those who are receiving drug treatment for fatigue, and those with psychiatric disorders. This suggests that the trial is aiming to select a specific subset of MS patients who are not currently receiving other treatments and who do not have certain comorbidities. This is more indicative of an explanatory trial, as it does not reflect the full range of patients who might receive the intervention in a real-world setting.

Score: [2]

**Recruitment**

Quotes: 
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants were recruited from two hospitals in the Parisian region, in France receiving outpatient services for MS at a regional medical center.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The recruitment process for this trial involved recruiting participants from two hospitals in the Parisian region. This suggests that the trial is aiming to recruit a specific subset of MS patients who are receiving outpatient services at these hospitals. This recruitment strategy may not fully reflect the diversity of patients who might receive the intervention in a real-world setting, suggesting a more explanatory approach.

Score: [2]

**Setting**

Quotes: 
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;This clinical and multicentric trial took place from July 2017 to January 2020, in two hospitals in the Parisian Region, France (Hospitals – CHI Poissy St Germain-en-Laye and R. Poincaré, Garches).&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial was conducted in two hospitals in the Parisian region, which suggests a somewhat controlled setting. While these hospitals may provide care for a diverse range of patients, the setting does not fully reflect the variety of settings in which the intervention might be delivered in a real-world context, such as in community clinics or patients' homes.

Score: [3]

**Organization**

Quotes: 
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Individuals participated in either a combination of PA and daily Mindfulness or a combination of PA and Implementation Intention.&quot;</span>
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Practicing sessions took place at home under the supervision of a physical and sports activity trainer specializing in sports training.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The organization of the intervention involved a combination of physical activity and either mindfulness or implementation intention, delivered under the supervision of a specialized trainer. This suggests a somewhat controlled approach to the delivery of the intervention, which may not fully reflect the resources and expertise available in a real-world setting.

Score: [3]

**Flexibility (delivery)**

Quotes: 
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;MBI participants received daily mindfulness training in the form of prerecorded sessions (6 sessions of 10 min each equal to 1 h/day) using TailorBuilder application, aiming at developing awareness of emotions and sensations.&quot;</span>
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Implementation Intention Participants were asked to develop a concrete if-then plan (the “if ” component followed by the “then” component) once a week and share them through TailorBuilder app.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The delivery of the intervention was quite structured, with participants receiving either daily mindfulness training through prerecorded sessions or weekly implementation intention training. This suggests a more explanatory approach, as the delivery of the intervention was tightly controlled and did not allow for much flexibility in how the intervention was delivered.

Score: [2]

**Flexibility (adherence)**

Quotes: 
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants were asked to listen to the prerecorded sessions and to follow the instructions.&quot;</span>
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants were able to modify their plans depending on their physical condition and availability.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The adherence to the intervention was somewhat flexible, with participants able to modify their plans depending on their physical condition and availability. However, participants were also expected to listen to prerecorded sessions and follow instructions, suggesting some level of control over adherence.

Score: [3]

**Follow-up**

Quotes: 
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Two measurement times are carried out in pre-post intervention, at baseline and after eight weeks.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The follow-up for this trial involved two measurement times, at baseline and after eight weeks. This suggests a somewhat controlled approach to follow-up, as the timing of follow-up assessments was predetermined and did not allow for much flexibility.

Score: [3]

**Primary outcome**

Quotes: 
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The primary outcomes, fatigue, mobility and quality of life, were examined at baseline prior to randomization, and then 8-weeks after the intervention (following the online intervention).&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The primary outcomes for this trial were fatigue, mobility, and quality of life, which are all relevant to the participants' daily lives and experiences with MS. This suggests a more pragmatic approach, as these outcomes reflect the real-world impact of the intervention on participants' lives.

Score: [5]

**Primary analysis**

Quotes: 
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;We used non-parametric tests due to the small sample sizes which deviate from the normality and equal variance assumptions.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The primary analysis for this trial involved the use of non-parametric tests, which suggests a more explanatory approach, as these tests are often used in trials with small sample sizes and do not assume a normal distribution of data.

The eligibility criteria for this trial are quite specific, excluding patients who had received hippotherapy within the last 12 months, those with a body weight over 90 kg, those with no balance while sitting, and those with acute exacerbation during the 4-week period before the start of the therapy. This suggests that the trial is more explanatory in nature, as it is not including a broad range of patients who might receive the intervention in a usual care setting.

It is mentioned that eligible patients were randomized, but there is no information on how patients were initially identified or approached for participation in the trial. Therefore, it is not possible to assess this domain based on the available information.
Score: [NA]

Setting:
- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The study was conducted at five sites in Germany, all of which have hippotherapy experience as stipulated by the rules of the German Consortium for Therapeutic Riding.&quot;</span>
The trial was conducted at five sites in Germany, all of which have experience with hippotherapy. This suggests that the trial setting is somewhat pragmatic, as it is conducted in multiple real-world locations where the intervention would likely be applied. However, the requirement for sites to have experience with hippotherapy may limit the generalizability of the results to other settings.
Score: [4]

Organisation:
- Quote: <span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 99.6%):

Patients of the intervention group received hippotherapy (as defined by the regulations for hippotherapy of the Deutsches Kuratorium für Therapeutisches Reiten e.V.

The organisation of the intervention in this trial is somewhat pragmatic, as it is delivered as an add-on to standard care and does not require significant changes to the usual organisation of care. However, the requirement for the intervention to be delivered according to specific regulations may limit its applicability in usual care settings where these regulations are not followed.

The delivery of the intervention in this trial is quite prescriptive, with patients receiving hippotherapy once a week for 12 weeks according to specific regulations. This suggests a more explanatory approach to the delivery of the intervention.
Score: [2]

Flexibility (adherence):
- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Over the study period, symptomatic drug treatment, immunotherapy, and physiotherapy were kept unchanged in both groups.&quot;</span>
The trial does not appear to have any special measures in place to ensure adherence to the intervention, suggesting a more pragmatic approach in this domain. However, the full text does not provide detailed information on this aspect of the trial.
Score: [4]

Follow-up:
- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Examinations and questionnaires were completed prior to the first hippotherapy session (baseline), after 6–7 weeks (interim assessment) and after 12 weeks (final assessment).&quot;</span>
The follow-up in this trial is somewhat prescriptive, with examinations and questionnaires completed at specific time points. This suggests a more explanatory approach to follow-up.

<pre>
1. Eligibility criteria:
- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants eligible for inclusion were adults aged over 15 years with one of the following possible recorded diagnoses: MS, PD and other causes of progressive parkinsonism, motor neurone disease, Huntington's disease and other degenerative disorders affecting the central nervous system, muscles or peripheral nerves.&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The trial includes a wide range of participants with different progressive neurological conditions, which makes the eligibility criteria more pragmatic. However, the exclusion of individuals with dementing disorders such as Alzheimer's disease and those with neurological complications of primarily non-neurological conditions like diabetes mellitus makes the criteria slightly less pragmatic.
- Score: [4]

2. Recruitment:
- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants were randomized to either the education group (EG) or the comparison group (CoG), within five diagnostic categories: MS, PD, Huntington's, motor neurone disease and other progressive neurological conditions.&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The recruitment process is not clearly described in the text. It is not clear how participants were approached or what efforts were made to recruit them. Therefore, it is not possible to assess the pragmatism of the recruitment process.
- Score: [NA]

3. Setting:
- Quote: <span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 97.3%):

The study took place between August 1997 and March 2000 and was approved by the research ethics committee of Queen&#39;s Medical Centre (Nottingham,' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;The study took place between August 1997 and March 2000 and was approved by the research ethics committee of Queen's Medical Centre (Nottingham, UK).&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The trial was conducted in a single location, which is less pragmatic as it does not reflect the diversity of settings in which the intervention might be applied in usual care. However, the setting is a real-world medical centre, which adds some pragmatism.
- Score: [2]

4. Organisation:
- Quote: <span title='Moderate quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 87.3%):

Baseline information from individuals in the EG was presented to an expert panel, which consisted of the research occupational therapist (OT) who carried out the subsequent education visit, a consultant in neurology and rehabilitation medicine, a GP, a social worker, a speech and language' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ff9e81'>&quot;Baseline information from individuals in the EG was presented to an expert panel, which consisted of the research occupational therapist (OT) who carried out the subsequent education visit, a consultant in neurology and rehabilitation medicine, a GP, a social worker, a speech and language therapist, a physiotherapist, and a nurse.&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The trial required a multidisciplinary expert panel and a research occupational therapist to deliver the intervention, which is not typically available in usual care settings. This makes the organisation of the trial less pragmatic.
- Score: [2]

5. Flexibility (delivery):
- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Within six weeks of the baseline visit, participants in the EG received an education visit from the research OT, who provided personalized advice and information based on the expert panel discussion, a tailored version of the standard information package, and a specially constructed leaflet offering information about the participant's condition and about self-help organizations.&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The intervention was delivered in a highly structured and standardized manner, with little flexibility in how it was implemented. This makes the delivery of the intervention less pragmatic.
- Score: [2]

6. Flexibility (adherence):
- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;An action plan was then proposed, and relevant phone numbers supplied. Approximately two weeks later, EG participants received a single follow-through phone call from the research OT to confirm and reinforce the educational content of the visit, after which EG patients had no subsequent contact with the OT.&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The trial protocol does not mention any measures to ensure participants' adherence to the intervention, which makes it more pragmatic. However, the follow-through phone call might be seen as a measure to enhance adherence.
- Score: [4]

7. Follow-up:
- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Information on adverse events was collected by phone at two-monthly intervals between baseline and 12-month assessments, when a general enquiry was made without specific reference to falls or sores.&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The follow-up process is more intensive than what would typically occur in usual care, with two-monthly phone calls over a 12-month period. This makes the follow-up process less pragmatic.
- Score: [2]

8. Primary outcome:
- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Primary outcome measures were reports of one or more falls or skin sores.&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The primary outcomes are clearly relevant to the participants and are likely to be measured in usual care, which makes this aspect of the trial more pragmatic.
- Score: [5]

9. Primary analysis:
- Quote: <span title='Moderate quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 75.2%):

For binary outcomes univariate and multivariate logistic regression were performed. Analyses were performed both with and without adjustment for baseline rates of events' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ff9e81'>&quot;For binary outcomes univariate and multivariate logistic regression were performed. Analyses were performed both with and without adjustment for baseline rates of events (falls or sores) and for the five diagnostic categories.&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The trial uses an intention-to-treat analysis, which is more pragmatic as it includes all available data. However, the use of adjustments in the analysis makes it slightly less pragmatic.

1. Eligibility criteria
- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Fifty relapsing patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) who had been on natalizumab therapy ≥24 months and were contemplating natalizumab discontinuation were enrolled.&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The study includes a specific group of patients who have been on natalizumab therapy for at least 24 months and are considering discontinuation. This is a very specific group and does not represent the general population of MS patients who might be considered for this intervention in usual care. Therefore, the eligibility criteria are more explanatory.
- Score: [2]

2. Recruitment
- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants who satisfied the inclusion criteria were randomised at baseline (week 0) to either the IDG or the TG according to a concealed computer-generated randomisation schedule.&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The recruitment process is not clearly described in the text. However, the fact that participants were randomized suggests that some effort was made to recruit participants beyond what would be used in the usual care setting. 
- Score: [NA]

3. Setting
- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;This was a prospective, phase IV, 12-month, open-label, single center single-blinded (MRI) randomised study.&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The trial was conducted in a single center, which limits the generalizability of the results to other settings. This is more indicative of an explanatory trial.
- Score: [2]

4. Organisation
- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants were randomised to either the immediate discontinuation group (IDG) or the tapered group (TG). IDG discontinued natalizumab at once and initiated another disease modifying therapy (DMT) following the last natalizumab infusion, while the TG received two more natalizumab infusions, at 6 and 8 weeks (14 weeks from study entry) before initiating another DMT.&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The trial required additional resources and expertise to deliver the intervention, including the administration of natalizumab infusions and the initiation of another DMT. This is not reflective of the usual organization of care for MS patients and is more indicative of an explanatory trial.
- Score: [2]

5. Flexibility (delivery)
- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Patients who discontinued natalizumab therapy at once and initiated another DMT (interferon, GA therapy or an oral DMT- fingolimod, dimethyl fumatate or teriflunomide) at 1–6 months following the last natalizumab infusion (1–2 months for the injectable DMTs and 3–6 months for the oral DMTs)&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The intervention delivery is highly protocol-driven with specific instructions on when to discontinue natalizumab and when to initiate another DMT. This lack of flexibility in delivery is more indicative of an explanatory trial.
- Score: [2]

6. Flexibility (adherence)
- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Discontinuation of participants from the allocated treatment or from the study was permitted as per patient request or treating physician decision.&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The trial allows for some flexibility in adherence, as participants could discontinue the allocated treatment or withdraw from the study based on their own decision or the decision of their treating physician. This is more indicative of a pragmatic trial.
- Score: [4]

7. Follow-up
- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;A physical examination and neurological assessment was administered at baseline, 3, 6 and 12 months postdiscontinuation (counted from the last natalizumab infusion), as well as during unscheduled visits due to relapses (within 3–5 days of any new symptom development).&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The follow-up schedule in the trial is more intense than what would typically occur in usual care, with scheduled visits at 3, 6, and 12 months post-discontinuation and additional unscheduled visits due to relapses. This is more indicative of an explanatory trial.
- Score: [2]

8. Primary outcome
- Quote: <span title='Moderate quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 94.8%):

- Reasoning: The primary outcome of the trial, which is the comparison of two modes of natalizumab cessation interventions as measured by serial MRI and number of relapses, is relevant to patients. However, the use of MRI as a measure is not typically used in usual care, making the primary outcome more explanatory.

Inclusion criteria were the following: diagnosis of MS made by a neurologist, able to walk 10 meters with or without an aid within 2 minutes, no relapse of their MS in the past 4 weeks, and no other neurological or orthopedic condition that would affect their function.&quot;</span>
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Eligible participants were excluded from the study if they were already engaged in a formal exercise program lasting >30 minutes twice per week, experienced an exacerbation within the past 4 weeks, had their MS immunomodulation medications altered in the previous 4 weeks or during the trial period, or declined to be randomly allocated.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The eligibility criteria for this trial are quite specific and may not reflect the broader population of individuals with MS who might receive this intervention in a usual care setting. For example, the exclusion of individuals already engaged in a formal exercise program or those who had a recent exacerbation or medication change may limit the generalizability of the trial results.

1. Eligibility criteria

Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Eligible participants were male 35–65 yr old with a BMI of Q28 kgIm j2 and met PA safety requirements (i.e., no risk indicated by the Physical Activity Readiness Questionnaire [36] or clearance from a health care provider).&quot;</span>
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;At baseline, groups were balanced on most demographic and health history characteristics, as well as study outcomes.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: 
The eligibility criteria for the trial were quite broad, including male fans of two ice hockey teams aged 35-65 with a BMI of 28 or above. This suggests a pragmatic approach as it includes a wide range of individuals who would be likely to receive the intervention in a real-world setting. However, the requirement for clearance from a healthcare provider or no risk indicated by the Physical Activity Readiness Questionnaire may slightly limit the generalizability of the trial to usual care.

Score: [4]

2. Recruitment

Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Recruitment occurred using a variety of methods (e.g., hockey team e-mail blasts and social media accounts, study Web site (http://hockeyfansintraining.org/), posters, traditional media advertisements, word of mouth, direct contact at team arena).&quot;</span>
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Across both sites, the most successful methods of recruitment included communication from the hockey team via e-mail or social media (e.g., Twitter) and word of mouth, where 40% and 36% of men were recruited, respectively.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: 
The recruitment methods used in the trial were diverse and included methods that would likely be used in a real-world setting, such as word of mouth and direct contact at the team arena. However, some methods, like traditional media advertisements and the study website, may not be typically used in usual care. 

Score: [4]

3. Setting

Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;We used a pragmatic approach for the program venue at each site, using a combination of the hockey team_s arena and an affiliated health club facility.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: 
The trial was conducted in settings that are likely to be similar to those where the intervention would be applied in real-world settings, such as the hockey team's arena and an affiliated health club facility. This suggests a pragmatic approach to the setting of the trial.

Score: [5]

4. Organisation

Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The Hockey FIT pro- gram was delivered over 12 weekly, 90-min sessions by Hockey FIT coaches (coach to participant ratio 2:20) from the central research team.&quot;</span>
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;In addition to the weekly in-person sessions, participants took part in an incremental pedometer-based walking program and they both set and tracked lifestyle prescriptions for PA (steps), exercise, and healthy eating.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: 
The organisation of the intervention required additional resources and expertise beyond what would typically be available in usual care, such as the Hockey FIT coaches and the pedometer-based walking program. This suggests a more explanatory approach to the organisation of the trial.

Score: [2]

5. Flexibility (delivery)

Quotes:
- <span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 99.5%):

6. Flexibility (adherence)

Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;For the remaining 30 men (i.e., program completers), the mean (SD) for percentage of sessions attended was 81.7% (13.7).&quot;</span>

Reasoning: 
The trial did not appear to have strict requirements for participant adherence to the intervention, as evidenced by the fact that some participants attended less than 100% of the sessions. This suggests a more pragmatic approach to the flexibility of adherence in the trial.

Score: [4]

7. Follow-up

Quotes:
- <span title='Moderate quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 88.9%):

12 wk (both groups) and 12 months (intervention group only) included clinical outcomes (e.g., weight) and self-reported physical activity, diet, and self-rated health.' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ff9e81'>&quot;Follow-up occurred at 12 wk (both groups) and 12 months (intervention group only) included clinical outcomes (e.g., weight) and self-reported physical activity, diet, and self-rated health.&quot;</span>

Score: [2]

8. Primary outcome

Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The planned primary outcome for the definitive trial was the difference between groups in mean weight loss (kg) and percentage weight change from baseline to 12 wk.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: 
The primary outcome of the trial, weight loss, is clearly relevant to the participants and is likely to be measured in a similar way in usual care. This suggests a pragmatic approach to the primary outcome of the trial.

Score: [5]

9. Primary analysis

Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;We analyzed outcome data to examine the potential effectiveness of the Hockey FIT program on the basis of an intent-to-treat approach.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: 
The primary analysis of the trial was conducted using an intention-to-treat approach, which includes all participants regardless of their adherence to the intervention. This is a pragmatic approach to the primary analysis of the trial.

Score: [1]

Flexibility (adherence):
Quotes: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;All of the pregnant women in labor where encouraged during the CB to breath in and out deeply in the direction of the thorax during the contractions and the intervals in orde for their bodies to be totally relaxed (slow thorax-abdomen breathing rhythm).&quot;</span>
Reasoning: The trial protocol includes specific instructions for participants to follow during the intervention, suggesting a more explanatory approach. However, it's not clear if there were any measures in place to monitor or enforce adherence to these instructions.
Score: [2]

Follow-up:
Quotes: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Information in relation to the use of medication and anesthesia was registered in accordance with the relevant procedures and were checked by a team of professionals at the institution. They looked at inpatient records, forms containing the use of anesthesia, partograms and medical prescriptions.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: The follow-up in this trial involves checking medical records and other forms of documentation, which is likely similar to what would occur in a usual care setting. This suggests a more pragmatic approach.
Score: [4]

Primary outcome:
Quotes: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The purpose of this study was to analyze the effects of acupressure on the SP6 point for the pain in child birth for expectant mothers in public maternity units.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: The primary outcome of this trial - pain during childbirth - is clearly relevant to the participants and is likely to be measured in a similar way in a usual care setting. This suggests a more pragmatic approach.

<p><i><span style="border-bottom: 1px dashed black;">9 quote(s) from
publication full text</span> (mean similarity 98.3%)</i></p>
<pre>
1. Eligibility criteria
- Quote: <span title='Moderate quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 84.6%):

Inclusion criteria were patients aged 45-65 with mild and moderate COPD (grade II and III) as the primary disease. No criteria were set for family members accompanying the patients.' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ff9e81'>&quot;Inclusion criteria were patients aged 45-65 with mild and moderate chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (grade II and III) as the primary disease. No criteria were set for family members accompanying the patients.&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The trial includes a specific age range and disease severity, which may not fully represent the usual care population. However, it does not exclude patients based on other factors such as comorbidities or adherence, which is more pragmatic.
- Score: [3]

2. Recruitment
- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;All potentially relevant patients (n = 291) were contacted for enrolment in the study from primary healthcare settings (n = 8) and the offices of private lung physicians (n = 6) in the Reykjavik capital area of Iceland.&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The recruitment process seems to be fairly pragmatic as it involves contacting patients from primary healthcare settings and private physicians' offices, which is likely to be similar to usual care settings.
- Score: [4]

3. Setting
- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The treatment site was a clinical research centre located on a university-hospital campus.&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The trial is conducted in a clinical research centre, which may not fully represent the usual care setting where the intervention would be applied. This leans towards a more explanatory approach.
- Score: [2]

4. Organisation
- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Experimental group (n = 48) participated in a 6-month, partnership-based self-management programme consisting of: (a) three to four conversations between nurse and patient-family member; (b) 6 months of smoking cessation; and (c) interdisciplinary team-patient-family member group meeting.&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The intervention requires additional resources and expertise (nurse-led conversations, smoking cessation program, interdisciplinary team meetings), which may not be readily available in usual care. This leans towards a more explanatory approach.
- Score: [2]

5. Flexibility (delivery)
- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The main approach is to work with patients and families to find out what is meaningful for them in life as regards health and jointly decide on that which is possible and relevant for each patient and family.&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The intervention allows for flexibility in its delivery, as it is tailored to the individual needs and preferences of the patients and their families. This is a pragmatic approach.
- Score: [5]

6. Flexibility (adherence)
- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The change from being a smoker to becoming a non-smoker was considered a process and participants given time to progress through that process as needed.&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The intervention allows for flexibility in adherence, recognizing that behavior change is a process and giving participants time to progress at their own pace. This is a pragmatic approach.
- Score: [5]

7. Follow-up
- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Data were collected at months zero, six and 12.&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The follow-up schedule is more frequent than what would typically occur under usual care, leaning towards a more explanatory approach.
- Score: [2]

8. Primary outcome
- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of a partnership-based self-management programme for patients with mild and moderate COPD.&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The primary outcome is the effectiveness of the self-management program, which is relevant to patients as it directly impacts their disease management. This is a pragmatic approach.
- Score: [5]

9. Primary analysis
- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The group (intervention) 9 time interaction from a repeated analysis of variance was used to measure whether or not the effect of intervention was statistically significant for variables that followed an approximately normal distribution.&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The analysis includes all data and does not exclude participants based on adherence or other factors, which is a pragmatic approach.

<p><i><span style="border-bottom: 1px dashed black;">9 quote(s) from
publication full text</span> (mean similarity 96.3%)</i></p>
<pre>
1. Eligibility criteria:
- Quote: <span title='Major quote deviation, possible hallucination. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 67.4%):

From their computerised asthma registers the practices identified adults (>18 years) who had asked for a bronchodilator inhaler prescription in the previDepartment' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: red'>&quot;From their computerised asthma registers the practices identified adults (>18 years) who had asked for a bronchodilator inhaler prescription in the previous six months but who had not had a routine asthma review in the preceding 11 months.&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The trial included adults with asthma who had not been reviewed in the previous 11 months, which is a broad and inclusive criterion. However, patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and those with communication difficulties were excluded, which may limit the generalizability of the results to the wider asthma population.
- Score: [4]

2. Recruitment:
- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;We wrote to all eligible patients inviting them to take part in the study.&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The recruitment process involved sending letters to eligible patients, which is a common practice in usual care. However, it is not clear whether additional recruitment strategies were used.
- Score: [4]

3. Setting:
- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Four general practices in England.&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The trial was conducted in four general practices, which is a typical setting for asthma care. However, the text does not provide information about the specific characteristics of these practices, such as their geographical location or the socioeconomic and ethnic mix of their patient populations.
- Score: [4]

4. Organisation:
- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;All four general practices that took part in the study had nurses who were trained and experienced in providing proactive asthma care.&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The trial used existing healthcare staff and resources in the participating practices, which is a pragmatic approach. However, it is not clear whether any additional resources or expertise were required to deliver the intervention.
- Score: [5]

5. Flexibility (delivery):
- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Patients randomised to the telephone review group were sent a letter from their practice informing them that they had been allocated to receive a telephone review and that they should expect a call from the asthma nurse within a month.&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The intervention was delivered flexibly via telephone, which is a pragmatic approach. However, the text does not provide information about whether the delivery of the intervention was protocol-driven or left up to the providers.
- Score: [5]

6. Flexibility (adherence):
- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Nurses arranged any follow up consultations (whether in the surgery or by telephone) they deemed clinically necessary. Patients were free to arrange any consultations they wished.&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The trial allowed for full flexibility in how patients engaged with the intervention, which is a pragmatic approach. There were no special measures to enforce patient compliance.
- Score: [5]

7. Follow-up:
- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Follow up questionnaires on morbidity and satisfaction with the consultation were sent to the patients at three months.&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The follow-up was conducted via questionnaires sent to the patients, which is a pragmatic approach. However, the text does not provide information about whether the intensity of follow-up was the same as in usual care.
- Score: [4]

8. Primary outcome:
- Quote: <span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 99.5%):

Primary outcome measures were the proportion of participants who were reviewed within three months of randomisation and disease specific quality of life, as measured by the Juniper mini asthma quality of life questionnaire.' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;Primary outcome measures were the proportion of patients reviewed within three months of randomisation and disease-specific quality of life, as measured by the Juniper mini asthma quality of life questionnaire.&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The primary outcomes were relevant to patients and measured in a way that is similar to how they would be measured in usual care, which is a pragmatic approach.
- Score: [5]

9. Primary analysis:
- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;On an intention to treat analysis, 101 of the 137 patients (74%) allocated to the telephone arm were reviewed, compared with 68 of the 141 patients (48%) in the face to face consultation arm.&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The trial used an intention-to-treat analysis, which is a pragmatic approach as it includes all data regardless of adherence to the intervention.

<p><i><span style="border-bottom: 1px dashed black;">10 quote(s) from
publication full text</span> (mean similarity 100%)</i></p>
<pre>
1. Eligibility criteria

Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The inclusion criteria were: a positive diagnosis of RA (1987 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria), age 18 years or older and the ability to complete questionnaires unaided.&quot;</span>
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Exclusions were: unstabilised concomitant disease, awaiting surgery and already receiving care from the practitioners involved in the study.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The eligibility criteria for this trial are quite broad, including anyone with a positive diagnosis of RA who is 18 years or older and able to complete questionnaires unaided. The exclusion criteria are also pragmatic, excluding only those with unstabilised concomitant disease, those awaiting surgery, and those already receiving care from the practitioners involved in the study. This suggests that the trial is likely to include a wide range of patients with RA, making it more representative of the general population of RA patients.

Score: [4]

2. Recruitment

Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;After gaining patient consent, demographics and disease activity score in 28 joints (DAS28), patients were randomly assigned using a remote secure telephone randomisation service provided by Leeds University Clinical Trials Research Unit.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The recruitment process for this trial is not explicitly described in the text. However, the use of a remote secure telephone randomisation service suggests that the recruitment process may have been somewhat systematic and potentially more explanatory than pragmatic. Without more information on how patients were initially identified and approached for participation, it is difficult to accurately assess this domain.

Score: [NA]

3. Setting

Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The study was conducted in outpatient clinics of 10 rheumatology centres across the UK.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial was conducted in outpatient clinics of 10 rheumatology centres across the UK. This suggests a pragmatic approach as it reflects the real-world setting where RA patients would typically receive care. The use of multiple centres also increases the generalizability of the trial results.

Score: [5]

4. Organisation

Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The NLC interventions usually include allocated 30-min time slots in which the CNS takes history, performs physical examination, pain control, prescribing or recommending medication and dosage changes, intra-articular or intramuscular steroid injections, provision of patient education, psychosocial support and ordering blood tests or X-rays.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The organisation of the intervention in this trial appears to be quite pragmatic. The nurse-led care (NLC) interventions are described as including a range of activities that would typically be performed in a usual care setting for RA patients, such as taking history, performing physical examinations, controlling pain, prescribing or recommending medication and dosage changes, providing patient education and psychosocial support, and ordering blood tests or X-rays.

Score: [4]

5. Flexibility (delivery)

Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The NLC interventions usually include allocated 30-min time slots in which the CNS takes history, performs physical examination, pain control, prescribing or recommending medication and dosage changes, intra-articular or intramuscular steroid injections, provision of patient education, psychosocial support and ordering blood tests or X-rays.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The delivery of the intervention in this trial appears to be quite flexible. The nurse-led care (NLC) interventions are described as including a range of activities that would typically be performed in a usual care setting for RA patients. This suggests that the delivery of the intervention was not rigidly prescriptive and allowed for some flexibility in how the intervention was delivered, which is more pragmatic.

Score: [4]

6. Flexibility (adherence)

Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Ninety-two per cent (83/90) of patient under NLC attended all five clinic sessions, with a mean total consultation time of 111 min compared to 85% (77/91) of the RLC group who had a mean total consultation time of 71 min.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial does not provide explicit information on measures taken to ensure participants' adherence to the intervention. However, the high attendance rate at clinic sessions suggests that participants were generally adherent to the intervention. Without more information on any specific measures taken to ensure or monitor adherence, it is difficult to accurately assess this domain.

Score: [NA]

7. Follow-up

Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Patients were seen by their respective practitioners at baseline and at weeks 13, 26, 39 and 52.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The follow-up in this trial appears to be quite pragmatic. Patients were seen by their respective practitioners at regular intervals over a one-year period, which is similar to what might be expected in a usual care setting for RA patients. The frequency of follow-up visits is not overly intensive, suggesting a more pragmatic approach.

Score: [4]

8. Primary outcome

Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The primary outcome was the disease activity score (DAS28) assessed at baseline, weeks 13, 26, 39 and 52.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The primary outcome of this trial, the disease activity score (DAS28), is a measure that is directly relevant to patients with RA and is commonly used in usual care to assess disease activity. This suggests a pragmatic approach to the choice of primary outcome.

Score: [5]

9. Primary analysis

Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Analysis followed per-protocol (PP) and intention-to-treat (ITT) approaches.&quot;</span>
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The primary endpoint shows that NLC was not inferior to RLC at any follow-up time point.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The primary analysis of this trial followed both per-protocol (PP) and intention-to-treat (ITT) approaches, which is a pragmatic approach as it includes all available data. The analysis was based on the principle of non-inferiority, suggesting that the trial aimed to determine whether the nurse-led care was at least as effective as rheumatologist-led care, which is a pragmatic question.

publication full text</span> (mean similarity 97.4%)</i></p>
<pre>
1. Eligibility criteria

- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants had established CVD or an estimated five-year CVD risk of 15%, with indications for antiplatelet, statin and 2 blood pressure lowering drugs (‘combination treatment’). Participants randomized to the ‘polypill-based strategy’ received a polypill containing aspirin 75 mg, simvastatin 40 mg, lisinopril 10 mg and either atenolol 50 mg or hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg.&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The trial includes participants with established cardiovascular disease or a high risk of cardiovascular disease, which is a broad and inclusive group. However, the trial does exclude individuals who do not have indications for the combination treatment, which is a somewhat restrictive criterion. 
- Score: [4]

2. Recruitment

- Quote: <span title='Moderate quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 79.5%):

A total of 623 participants were randomized from 33 centres (12 Aboriginal Medical Services) between 9' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ff9e81'>&quot;A total of 623 participants were randomized from 33 centres (12 Aboriginal Medical Services) between January 2010 and May 2012.&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The trial recruited participants from a variety of centers, including Aboriginal Medical Services, which suggests a pragmatic approach to recruitment. However, the text does not provide detailed information about the recruitment process, such as whether participants were recruited through usual appointments or other methods.
- Score: [NA]

3. Setting

- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants attended the primary healthcare centres for trial assessments at randomization and 12 month intervals thereafter.&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The trial was conducted in primary healthcare centers, which is a typical setting for the delivery of the intervention in usual care. This suggests a pragmatic approach to the setting.
- Score: [5]

4. Organisation

- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;All participants were treated by their regular doctor following randomization. No attempt was made to influence the management of usual care participants.&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The trial used existing healthcare staff and resources, with participants treated by their regular doctors. This suggests a pragmatic approach to the organization of care.
- Score: [5]

5. Flexibility (delivery)

- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Those allocated to the polypill-based strategy were prescribed one of the polypill versions at the discretion of their doctor, to be taken at a time suggested by the doctor.&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The trial allowed for flexibility in the delivery of the intervention, with the choice of polypill version and timing of administration left to the discretion of the doctor. This suggests a pragmatic approach to delivery flexibility.
- Score: [5]

6. Flexibility (adherence)

- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The doctor could, at any time, change prescription to the alternative polypill version, add drugs on top of the polypill, or withdraw the polypill and substitute individual drugs of their choice.&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The trial allowed for flexibility in participant adherence to the intervention, with the doctor able to change the prescription as needed. This suggests a pragmatic approach to adherence flexibility.
- Score: [5]

7. Follow-up

- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants attended the primary healthcare centres for trial assessments at randomization and 12 month intervals thereafter.&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The trial used a standard follow-up schedule, with assessments at 12-month intervals. This is a typical follow-up schedule in usual care, suggesting a pragmatic approach to follow-up.
- Score: [5]

8. Primary outcome

- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Primary outcomes were self-reported combination treatment use, systolic blood pressure and total cholesterol.&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The primary outcomes of the trial are relevant to participants and are typically measured in usual care, suggesting a pragmatic approach to the primary outcome.
- Score: [5]

9. Primary analysis

- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;All analyses were conducted on an intention-to-treat basis without imputation of missing data.&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The trial used an intention-to-treat analysis, which includes all randomized participants in the analysis and is a typical approach in usual care. This suggests a pragmatic approach to the primary analysis.

<pre>
1. Eligibility criteria

- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Patients were eligible for inclusion if they were aged 16 years or older and presented within 3 weeks after sustaining a displaced fracture of the proximal humerus that involved the surgical neck.&quot;</span>
- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Excluded patients had associated dislocation of the injured shoulder joint, open fracture, insufficient mental capacity to understand the trial or instructions for rehabilitation, comorbidities precluding surgery or anesthesia, clear indication for surgery such as severe soft-tissue compromise, multiple injuries (upper limb fractures), pathological fracture (other than osteoporotic), terminal illness, or were not a resident in the hospital catchment area.&quot;</span>

The eligibility criteria for this trial are quite specific, excluding patients with certain conditions or circumstances that could complicate the trial or the intervention. This suggests a more explanatory approach, as the trial is not including all patients who might receive the intervention in a real-world setting. However, the criteria do seem to reflect realistic considerations for who would receive this intervention in usual care, which adds a pragmatic element.

Score: [3]

2. Recruitment

- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The PROFHER collaborators recruited patients for this pragmatic, open, multicenter, parallel-group, superiority, randomized clinical trial between September 2008 and April 2011 from orthopedic departments (fracture clinics or wards) at 32 acute UK National Health Service hospitals.&quot;</span>

The recruitment process for this trial involved multiple centers and was conducted through orthopedic departments, suggesting a more pragmatic approach as this reflects how patients would typically be identified for this intervention in a real-world setting.

Score: [4]

3. Setting

- Quote: <span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 99.3%):

Patients received their allocated treatment from the recruiting hospital. Care pathways for all patients included outpatientand community-based rehabilitation, which primarily comprised 1 or more 1-on-1 sessions with a physiotherapist that focused on restoring function.' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;Patients received their allocated treatment from the recruiting hospital. Care pathways for all patients included outpatient- and community-based rehabilitation, which primarily comprised 1 or more 1-on-1 sessions with a physiotherapist that focused on restoring function.&quot;</span>

The trial was conducted in a real-world setting, with patients receiving treatment at the hospital where they were recruited and following typical care pathways. This suggests a highly pragmatic approach.

Score: [5]

4. Organisation

- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;To avoid learning curve problems, surgeons and physiotherapists used surgical interventions and procedures with which they were familiar.&quot;</span>

The trial made use of existing healthcare staff and resources, with surgeons and physiotherapists using procedures they were already familiar with. This suggests a highly pragmatic approach, as it reflects the resources and expertise that would be available in a real-world setting.

Score: [5]

5. Flexibility (delivery)

- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants allocated to surgery received either internal fracture fixation (eg, with plate and screws) that preserved the humeral head or humeral head replacement (hemiarthroplasty). Participants allocated to nonsurgical treatment were given a sling for the injured arm for as long as deemed necessary (3 weeks was suggested), followed by active rehabilitation.&quot;</span>

The trial allowed for flexibility in the delivery of the intervention, with different surgical procedures used depending on the individual patient's needs. This suggests a more pragmatic approach, as it reflects the variability in treatment delivery that would be seen in a real-world setting.

Score: [4]

6. Flexibility (adherence)

- Quote: <span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 99.2%):

. Physiotherapy treatment log data demonstrated equal access and implementation between groups, with similarly high numbers of participants recorded as performing home exercises (109 in surgical group vs 103 in nonsurgical group) in both group' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;Physiotherapy treatment log data demonstrated equal access and implementation between groups, with similarly high numbers of participants recorded as performing home exercises (109 in surgical group vs 103 in nonsurgical group) in both groups.&quot;</span>

The trial did not appear to have strict measures in place to ensure adherence to the intervention, with patients performing home exercises as part of their rehabilitation. This suggests a more pragmatic approach, as it reflects the variability in patient adherence that would be seen in a real-world setting.

Score: [4]

7. Follow-up

- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Patients were followed up for 2 years (up to April 2013) and 215 had complete follow-up data. The data for 231 patients (114 in surgical group and 117 in nonsurgical group) were included in the primary analysis.&quot;</span>

The follow-up period for this trial was relatively long, reflecting a more pragmatic approach as it allows for a more realistic assessment of the intervention's effects over time. However, the fact that not all patients had complete follow-up data could suggest some challenges in maintaining follow-up in a real-world setting.

Score: [4]

8. Primary outcome

- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Primary outcome was the Oxford Shoulder Score (range, 0-48; higher scores indicate better outcomes) assessed during a 2-year period, with assessment and data collection at 6, 12, and 24 months.&quot;</span>

The primary outcome for this trial was a patient-reported measure of shoulder function, which is highly relevant to patients and reflects a more pragmatic approach. However, the use of a specific scoring system may not reflect how outcomes would typically be assessed in a real-world setting.

Score: [4]

9. Primary analysis

- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;All analyses were on an intention-to-treat basis and included all randomized patients in the groups to which they were randomized.&quot;</span>

The trial used an intention-to-treat analysis, which includes all randomized patients in the groups to which they were randomized. This reflects a more pragmatic approach, as it includes all patients regardless of adherence to the intervention or other factors that might influence outcomes.

1. Eligibility criteria

Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Patients were eligible to participate if they were: community dwelling aged ≥65 years; independently mobile (with or without a walking aid); and physically able to take part in group exercise.&quot;</span>
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Patients were excluded if they: had experienced ≥3 falls in the previous year; had unstable clinical conditions; would be unable to follow instructions about exercise safely; or were receiving palliative care.&quot;</span>
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Attempts were made to exclude those who were already exercising at, or above, the target level through a pre-assessment screening telephone call.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The eligibility criteria for this trial are quite pragmatic. The trial includes community-dwelling older adults who are independently mobile and physically able to participate in group exercise, which is a broad and inclusive group. However, the trial excludes individuals who have experienced multiple falls in the past year, have unstable clinical conditions, or are unable to follow exercise instructions safely. These exclusions are reasonable and likely reflect the usual care setting, as these individuals may not be suitable candidates for an exercise intervention. The trial also attempts to exclude those already meeting the target level of physical activity, which is a somewhat explanatory feature.

Score: [4]

2. Recruitment

Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Patients aged ≥65 years were identified by searches of computerised medical records and invited to participate by letter from their GP.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The recruitment strategy for this trial is somewhat pragmatic. Patients are identified through searches of computerized medical records and invited to participate by their GP, which is a method that could be used in usual care. However, the full text does not provide information on whether additional recruitment strategies were used, such as advertising or incentives, which could potentially reduce the PRECIS-2 score.

Score: [4]

3. Setting

Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Practices were recruited with assistance from Primary Care Research Networks for London, Derby, and Nottingham.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial is conducted in general practices in London, Derby, and Nottingham, which is a typical setting for the delivery of primary care. This suggests a pragmatic approach to the setting domain. However, the full text does not provide information on the specific characteristics of these practices, such as their size, location, or patient population, which could potentially influence the applicability of the trial results.

Score: [4]

4. Organisation

Quotes:
- <span title='Major quote deviation, possible hallucination. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 74.8%):

Otago Exercise Programme (OEP), 10 and a group-based exercise programme called Falls Management Exercise (FaME).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: red'>&quot;The interventions were the home-based Otago Exercise Programme (OEP), and a group-based exercise programme called Falls Management Exercise (FaME).&quot;</span>
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Volunteer peer mentors supported participants in the OEP arm, and weekly FaME classes were run in local venues by postural stability instructors trained to work with older people.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The organisation of the trial intervention involves both home-based and group-based exercise programs, which are delivered by trained instructors and supported by volunteer peer mentors. This suggests a somewhat pragmatic approach, as these resources could potentially be available in usual care. However, the use of trained instructors and peer mentors may not be typical in all usual care settings, which could reduce the PRECIS-2 score.

Score: [3]

5. Flexibility (delivery)

Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The FaME intervention took place in a group once a week and included exercises to be carried out at home, unsupervised, twice weekly. The OEP was undertaken at home, unsupervised, and comprised exercises to be done three times per week.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The delivery of the trial intervention is quite flexible. The FaME program involves a combination of group classes and unsupervised home exercises, while the OEP is entirely home-based and unsupervised. This suggests a pragmatic approach, as it allows for individual variation in how the intervention is implemented.

Score: [5]

6. Flexibility (adherence)

Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Adherence was defined as (minutes spent exercising/intended minutes) 100%, where patients with values exceeding 75% were regarded as ‘adherent’.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial measures adherence to the intervention in terms of the proportion of intended exercise minutes completed, with a threshold of 75% for being considered adherent. This suggests a somewhat explanatory approach, as it involves monitoring and quantifying participant adherence, which may not be typical in usual care.

Score: [3]

7. Follow-up

Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants were followed up every 6 months after the end of the intervention period, until 24 months.&quot;</span>
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Falls were ascertained from diaries returned by participants every 4 weeks during the intervention and every 3 months in the subsequent year, and from reports given in follow-up telephone interviews using the Phone-FITT questionnaire.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The follow-up in this trial is somewhat intensive, with participants being followed up every 6 months for 2 years and asked to return diaries every 4 weeks during the intervention and every 3 months thereafter. This suggests a more explanatory approach, as it involves more frequent and extensive data collection than would typically occur in usual care.

Score: [2]

8. Primary outcome

Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The primary outcome was the proportion of participants who reported reaching ≥150 minutes of MVPA per week.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The primary outcome of this trial is clearly relevant to participants, as it measures the proportion of participants who achieve a recommended level of physical activity. This suggests a pragmatic approach, as this outcome is likely to be meaningful to both patients and healthcare providers in usual care.

Score: [5]

9. Primary analysis

Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants were analysed in the groups to which they were randomised, regardless of whether they received the intervention or not, and multiple imputation was used to include all participants in the analyses.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The primary analysis of this trial is an intention-to-treat analysis using all available data, which is a highly pragmatic approach. This analysis includes all participants regardless of whether they received the intervention or not, and uses multiple imputation to account for missing data, which reflects the reality of usual care where not all patients adhere to the intervention and data may be missing.

<p><i><span style="border-bottom: 1px dashed black;">9 quote(s) from
publication full text</span> (mean similarity 99%)</i></p>
<pre>
1. Eligibility criteria
- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants were included who scored >2 on the General Health Questionnaire 12, a measure of psychological distress, or >7 on the anxiety and depression subscales of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, thus confirming they had low mood.&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The eligibility criteria for this trial are quite specific, requiring participants to have a certain score on two different psychological distress scales. This suggests that the trial is not including all individuals with multiple sclerosis, but rather a subset of these individuals who also have low mood. This makes the trial less generalizable to the broader population of individuals with multiple sclerosis.
- Score: [2]

2. Recruitment
- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants were recruited for a randomized trial of adjustment groups for people with multiple sclerosis and low mood between June 2008 and September 2009.&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The text does not provide specific details about how participants were recruited, such as whether they were recruited from a specific clinic or through broader advertising efforts. Without this information, it is difficult to assess how pragmatic the recruitment process was.
- Score: [NA]

3. Setting
- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The groups were delivered by two Band 5 assistant psychologists, who were supervised by a Band 8a clinical psychologist, experienced in working with people with multiple sclerosis.&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The trial was conducted in a setting that involved psychologists experienced in working with people with multiple sclerosis. This suggests that the trial setting may not be representative of usual care settings, where such specialized expertise may not be available.
- Score: [2]

4. Organisation
- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The groups involved teaching people to recognise symptoms of distress and introduced them to strategies to improve their mood.&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The intervention was delivered in a structured group setting, which may not reflect the usual care setting for individuals with multiple sclerosis. Additionally, the intervention required the involvement of specialized healthcare professionals (psychologists), which may not be available in all usual care settings.
- Score: [2]

5. Flexibility (delivery)
- Quote: <span title='Moderate quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 91.3%):

se allocated to intervention were invited to attend a psychological adjustment group for six sessions over 12 weeks.' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ff9e81'>&quot;Participants allocated to intervention were invited to attend a psychological adjustment group for six sessions over 12 weeks.&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The intervention was delivered in a structured format with a set number of sessions over a specific time period. This suggests a lack of flexibility in the delivery of the intervention, as it does not allow for individual variations in treatment needs or preferences.
- Score: [2]

6. Flexibility (adherence)
- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants allocated to the control group received all other rehabilitation routinely provided and were offered the opportunity to attend groups once they had completed the study.&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The text does not provide specific information about measures taken to ensure participants' adherence to the intervention. However, the fact that control group participants were offered the opportunity to attend the intervention groups after the study suggests some flexibility in adherence to the study protocol.
- Score: [NA]

7. Follow-up
- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Four and eight months after random allocation, participants were sent a booklet of outcome questionnaires to complete and return by post.&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The follow-up process involved sending participants questionnaires by post, which may not reflect the usual care follow-up process. This suggests a more explanatory approach to follow-up.
- Score: [2]

8. Primary outcome
- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Effectiveness was initially defined as the change in EQ-5D scores and a cost-effectiveness analysis was performed using this outcome measure.&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The primary outcome of the trial was the change in EQ-5D scores, a measure of health-related quality of life. This is a patient-relevant outcome that is likely to be of interest in usual care settings, suggesting a more pragmatic approach to the choice of primary outcome.
- Score: [4]

9. Primary analysis
- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The incremental costs effectiveness ratio was calculated by dividing the mean reduction in costs between intervention and control (−£401) by the mean reduction in BDI score (−3.41).&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The primary analysis included all available data and used an intention-to-treat approach, which is consistent with a pragmatic approach to analysis.
- Score: [5]</pre>

<p><i><span style="border-bottom: 1px dashed black;">9 quote(s) from
publication full text</span> (mean similarity 100%)</i></p>
<pre>
1. Eligibility criteria
- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The inclusion criteria were being definitely diagnosed with MS and having records in the Society and the exclusion criteria having history of other psychiatric disorders including major depressive disorder (according to the medical records and the physician's examinations) or bipolar disorder (except for cognitive disorders by which MS is characterized), substance dependency, any neurological disorders, history of taking corticosteroids or the disease recurrence within the previous six months.&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The eligibility criteria for this trial are quite specific and exclude a number of potential participants, such as those with other psychiatric disorders, substance dependency, other neurological disorders, or a history of taking corticosteroids or disease recurrence within the previous six months. This suggests a more explanatory approach, as the trial is not including a broad range of patients who might be seen in usual care.
- Score: [2]

2. Recruitment
- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;After eligible patients referred to the Association, a number was randomly assigned to each patient according to his/her referring time and the patients were assigned to the two groups.&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The recruitment process seems to be quite straightforward, with patients being assigned to groups based on their referral time. However, it's not clear how these patients were initially identified or recruited, and whether this process would be replicable in a usual care setting.
- Score: [NA]

3. Setting
- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;This clinical trial was conducted in 2015e2016 and registered as IRCT2014112420064N1 in the Iranian Register of Clinical Trials. The study population consists the patients referring to the Multiple Sclerosis Society of Isfahan.&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The trial was conducted at the Multiple Sclerosis Society of Isfahan, which suggests that it may not be representative of a typical care setting. However, without more information about the usual care setting for MS patients in Iran, it's difficult to assess how pragmatic this choice of setting is.
- Score: [NA]

4. Organisation
- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The intervention was implemented within two days a week. For the control group, a routine protocol was conducted. For blinding, the patients of the control group referred to the Society on certain days of week and those of the experimental on other days.&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The organisation of the trial seems to require additional resources and coordination compared to usual care, with specific days for the control and experimental groups and the intervention being implemented twice a week. This suggests a more explanatory approach.
- Score: [2]

5. Flexibility (delivery)
- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The intervention consisted of: defining depression, stress, anxiety, and their symptoms, defining happiness, and explaining its necessity, reviewing the results of previous studies on happiness (the first session); the technique of increasing physical activity, the technique of being productive, and doing useful and meaningful things (the second session); the principles of planning and better organization–the technique of removing concerns, the technique of reducing expectations and wishes (the third session); the technique of enhancing creativity, the technique of living at present (the fourth session; the technique of increasing social relationships, the technique of being the real self (the fifth session).&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The intervention is highly structured and prescriptive, with specific techniques and topics for each session. This suggests a more explanatory approach, as it does not allow for much flexibility in how the intervention is delivered.
- Score: [1]

6. Flexibility (adherence)
- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;At the end of each session, the participants were asked to run through certain drills empirically outside research environment.&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The trial requires participants to complete specific drills outside of the research environment, which suggests a more explanatory approach as it requires a high level of adherence from participants.
- Score: [2]

7. Follow-up
- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Moreover, to investigate the efficacy of the FHM, the DASS-21 and Piper Standard Scale were administered to the experimental group in the follow-up session.&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The trial includes a follow-up session to assess the efficacy of the intervention, but it's not clear how this compares to usual care. Without more information, it's difficult to assess how pragmatic this aspect of the trial is.
- Score: [NA]

8. Primary outcome
- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;This study was conducted to investigate the effect of Fordyce Happiness Model (FHM) on depression, stress, anxiety, and fatigue in MS patients.&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The primary outcomes of the trial - depression, stress, anxiety, and fatigue - are all highly relevant to the participants and are likely to be important in a usual care setting. This suggests a more pragmatic approach.
- Score: [5]

9. Primary analysis
- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The data obtained before and after conduction of the program were analyzed by chi-square test, Mann-Whitney, covariance statistics, repeated measures ANOVA, and independent t-test in SPSS 18.&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The trial uses a range of statistical tests to analyze the data, but it's not clear whether all data are included in the analysis or whether any adjustments are made for non-adherence or other factors. Without more information, it's difficult to assess how pragmatic this aspect of the trial is.

<pre>
1. Eligibility criteria

Quotes:
- <span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 99.4%):

Persons with MS (N ¼ 183) with cognitive concerns were randomly assigned to either the 8week MAPSS-MS intervention or usual care plus freely available computer games.' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;Persons with MS (N ¼ 183) with cognitive concerns were randomly assigned to either the 8-week MAPSS-MS intervention or usual care plus freely available computer games.&quot;</span>
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The 347 persons who were initially screened as “eligible” were later contacted by phone to invite their participation during specific dates.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial included participants with MS who had cognitive concerns, which is a broad group that likely represents a significant portion of the MS population. However, the specific eligibility criteria are not detailed in the text, making it difficult to assess how closely the trial population represents the general MS population.

Score: [NA]

2. Recruitment

Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants were recruited via physician referral, targeted mailings to persons with MS on the mailing list of the National MS Society, contact with support groups, and notices in MS newsletters and web sites.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The recruitment methods used in the trial, such as physician referrals and targeted mailings, are not typically used in usual care. This suggests a more explanatory approach to recruitment.

Score: [2]

3. Setting

Quotes:
- <span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 99.4%):

The small group-based intervention and the 6 months of followup testing were delivered to 10 cohorts of participants across the three sites over a 34-month period.' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;The small group-based intervention and the 6 months of follow-up testing were delivered to 10 cohorts of participants across the three sites over a 34-month period.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial was conducted across three different sites, which suggests a more pragmatic approach as it increases the generalizability of the results. However, the specific settings of these sites are not described in the text.

Score: [NA]

4. Organisation

Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The MAPSS-MS intervention aims to help persons with MS acquire the highest level of cognitive functioning and functional independence. The intervention includes group sessions (2 h per week for 8 weeks) focused on building efficacy for use of cognitive strategies and a home-based computer training program (45 min three times per week).&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The intervention required additional resources and expertise beyond usual care, including group sessions and a home-based computer training program. This suggests a more explanatory approach to organisation.

Score: [2]

5. Flexibility (delivery)

Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The facilitator prescribed exercises from a study-specific protocol addressing the most common deficits experienced by persons with MS (attention, memory, flexibility, and problem solving).&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The intervention was delivered according to a specific protocol, which suggests a more explanatory approach to flexibility in delivery.

Score: [2]

6. Flexibility (adherence)

Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Overall, participation in the intervention was high. The mean number of classes attended was 6.4 (SD ¼ 2.3, range 0e8) for those randomized to the MAPSS-MS group.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The text does not provide information on measures taken to ensure participant adherence to the intervention, making it difficult to assess this domain.

Score: [NA]

7. Follow-up

Quotes:
- <span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 99.5%):

The effects of the intervention on outcomes were assessed over an 8-month period, with measurements at baseline, immediately after the 8-week MAPPS intervention, and at 3 and 6 months postintervention.' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;The effects of the intervention on outcomes were assessed over an 8-month period, with measurements at baseline, immediately after the 8-week MAPPS intervention, and at 3 and 6 months post-intervention.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The follow-up period in the trial was longer than the intervention period, which suggests a more pragmatic approach as it allows for the assessment of longer-term effects of the intervention.

Score: [4]

8. Primary outcome

Quotes:
- <span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 99.5%):

The primary purpose of this study was to determine the effectiveness of a novel computerassisted cognitive rehabilitation intervention MAPSS-MS (Memory, Attention, Problem Solving Skills in MS) in a multi-site trial with persons with MS.' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;The primary purpose of this study was to determine the effectiveness of a novel computer-assisted cognitive rehabilitation intervention MAPSS-MS in a multi-site trial with persons with MS.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The primary outcome of the trial, the effectiveness of the MAPSS-MS intervention, is relevant to participants as it directly impacts their cognitive functioning. This suggests a more pragmatic approach to the primary outcome.

Score: [5]

9. Primary analysis

Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;A repeated measures ANOVA (RM-ANOVA) design was utilized to determine time and time by group effects on performance and self-report outcomes.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial used an intention-to-treat analysis, which includes all participants regardless of their adherence to the intervention. This suggests a more pragmatic approach to the primary analysis.

1. Eligibility criteria

Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Inclusion criteria were (1) 18–60 years of age, (2) ⩽2 years since clinical diagnosis with relapsing remitting MS (RRMS) and (3) no relapses or changes in medication status 8 weeks prior to inclusion.&quot;</span>
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Patients gave informed written consent prior to inclusion.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The eligibility criteria for this trial are quite specific, including age range, time since diagnosis, and recent health status. This suggests that the trial is not fully representative of the broader population of people with MS, as it excludes those outside the age range, those with a longer time since diagnosis, and those who have had recent relapses or medication changes. 

Score: [2]

2. Recruitment

Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Patients (n = 84) were recruited in collaboration with six Danish regional MS clinics and The Danish MS Society.&quot;</span>
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Patients were randomized to the two study conditions by the sealed envelope principle in a 1:1 ratio stratified by line of treatment.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The recruitment process involved collaboration with multiple clinics and a national MS society, suggesting a broad recruitment strategy. However, the specific methods used to recruit participants are not detailed, making it difficult to assess how similar this process would be to usual care.

Score: [NA]

3. Setting

Quotes:
- <span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 99.6%):

The present study is a national multicentre singleblinded parallel group randomized controlled trial (RCT) comparing two groups receiving either supervised exercise therapy (intervention group) or health education (active control group).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;The present study is a national multicentre single-blinded parallel group randomized controlled trial (RCT) comparing two groups receiving either supervised exercise therapy (intervention group) or health education (active control group).&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial was conducted across multiple centers, which suggests a more pragmatic approach as it increases the generalizability of the results. However, the full text does not provide enough information about the specific settings in which the trial was conducted.

Score: [NA]

4. Organisation

Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The supervised exercise sessions were performed twice weekly for the full study period of 48 weeks, and was planned on the basis of four principles (adapted from Stathopoulos and Felson Duchan) 13 : (1) individual tailoring, (2) application of exercise types matching the goal of the intervention, (3) progressive overload and (4) sufficient intensity to induce the desired effects of the intervention.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The intervention required significant organization, including twice-weekly supervised exercise sessions for 48 weeks. This level of organization may not be feasible in usual care settings, suggesting a more explanatory approach.

Score: [2]

5. Flexibility (delivery)

Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The exercise intervention was planned as high-intense aerobic exercise, monitored relative to the patients’ individual maximal heart rate (HRmax), and progressed within and between 4 meso cycles of 12 weeks.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The intervention was highly structured and standardized, with little flexibility in how it was delivered. This suggests a more explanatory approach, as it may not reflect the variability in how exercise interventions would be delivered in usual care.

Score: [2]

6. Flexibility (adherence)

Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Patients in the supervised exercise group completed 90.0 (8.6)% of the planned sessions at an average intensity of 84.4 (3.0)% HRmax (for comparison, the planned average intensity was 76.2% HRmax).&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial required a high level of adherence from participants, with specific expectations for session completion and exercise intensity. This suggests a more explanatory approach, as it may not reflect the variability in adherence that would be expected in usual care.

Score: [2]

7. Follow-up

Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The study period covers 48 weeks with outcome assessment at baseline (T0), after 24 weeks (T24), and after 48 weeks (T48).&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The follow-up schedule in this trial is quite structured, with specific time points for outcome assessment. This may not reflect the variability in follow-up schedules that would be expected in usual care, suggesting a more explanatory approach.

Score: [2]

8. Primary outcome

Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The aim of the present study was therefore to investigate the efficacy of supervised exercise therapy in newly diagnosed patients (⩽2 years since diagnosis) on primarily relapse rate and global brain atrophy and secondarily on regional brain atrophy, lesion load and diffusion-kurtosis MRI-measures of microstructural integrity.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The primary outcomes of this trial, relapse rate and global brain atrophy, are clinically relevant and likely to be important to patients. This suggests a more pragmatic approach.

Score: [4]

9. Primary analysis

Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;A Poisson regression controlling for a priori defined potential confounding variables (age, gender and time since diagnosis) and expressed as an incidence-rate-ratio was applied to compare the annual relapse rate between the RCT groups.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The primary analysis included all available data and controlled for potential confounding variables. This suggests a more pragmatic approach, as it reflects the complexity and variability of real-world data.

publication full text</span> (mean similarity 98.9%)</i></p>
<pre>
1. Eligibility criteria
- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The inclusion criteria were: males and females; age 18 to 70; diagnosis of MS (primary or secondary progressive, relapsing-remitting), without relapses in the preceding three months and an Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score between 4 and 5.5.&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The eligibility criteria for this trial are quite specific, including age, gender, diagnosis, and EDSS score. This suggests that the trial is not fully representative of the broader population of people with MS, as it excludes those outside the specified age range, those with different types of MS, and those with different EDSS scores. This suggests a more explanatory approach to the trial design.
- Score: [2]

2. Recruitment
- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Patients have been recruited at Ferrara University Hospital from patients who attend the Rehabilitation Outpatient Clinic for gait rehabilitation.&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The recruitment process for this trial is quite specific, with participants being recruited from a single hospital's outpatient clinic. This suggests that the trial may not be fully representative of the broader population of people with MS, as it excludes those who do not attend this specific clinic. This suggests a more explanatory approach to the trial design.
- Score: [2]

3. Setting
- Quote: <span title='Moderate quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 90.5%):

have been randomly assigned to 10 supervised TOCT sessions over two weeks (Phase 1) followed by a 12-weeks home-based task-oriented program (Phase 2) or a delayed-treatment group.' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ff9e81'>&quot;Eligible patients have been randomized to 10 supervised TOCT sessions over two weeks (Phase 1) followed by a 12-weeks home-based task-oriented program (Phase 2) or a delayed-treatment group.&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The setting for this trial is a combination of a supervised clinical setting and a home-based setting. This suggests a more pragmatic approach, as it reflects the real-world settings in which people with MS would likely receive treatment. However, the use of a delayed-treatment group suggests a more explanatory approach.
- Score: [4]

4. Organisation
- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Phase 1 was composed of six gait-based workstations and treadmill training, whereas Phase 2 was based on progressive task-oriented tasks practice at home with monthly visits to adjust activities levels.&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The organisation of this trial involves a combination of supervised clinical sessions and home-based sessions, with regular visits to adjust the activities. This suggests a more pragmatic approach, as it reflects the real-world settings in which people with MS would likely receive treatment. However, the use of specific workstations and treadmill training suggests a more explanatory approach.
- Score: [3]

5. Flexibility (delivery)
- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;At home, we recommended 60-minute sessions three times/week. The home-based program includes overground walking practice and exercises with similar modalities and difficulty as learnt during Phase 1.&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The delivery of the intervention in this trial is somewhat flexible, with participants being able to complete the exercises at home at their own convenience. However, the exercises are still quite structured and specific, suggesting a more explanatory approach.
- Score: [3]

6. Flexibility (adherence)
- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;A mean adherence of 6.2 out of 10 was reported for the home-based TOCT program.&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The adherence to the intervention in this trial is somewhat flexible, with participants being able to complete the exercises at home at their own convenience. However, adherence is still monitored and reported, suggesting a more explanatory approach.
- Score: [3]

7. Follow-up
- Quote: <span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 99.6%):

- Reasoning: The follow-up in this trial is quite structured, with specific time points for assessments. This suggests a more explanatory approach, as it does not reflect the more flexible follow-up that might occur in a real-world setting.
- Score: [2]

8. Primary outcome
- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The primary outcome measure was the 6-minute walking test (6MWT) for walking endurance.&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The primary outcome of this trial is a measure of walking endurance, which is likely to be highly relevant to people with MS. This suggests a more pragmatic approach, as it reflects an outcome that is important to the patient population.
- Score: [5]

9. Primary analysis
- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;An intention-to-treat analysis was carried out on all outcome measures, handling missing data (n = 2 at T1, n = 7 at T2) with the last observation carried forward approach.&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The primary analysis of this trial is an intention-to-treat analysis, which includes all participants regardless of their adherence to the intervention. This suggests a more pragmatic approach, as it reflects the reality that not all participants will adhere to the intervention in a real-world setting.

Eligibility Criteria:
1. Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Patients with diabetes mellitus or hypertension or who gave a history of psychiatric illness or peptic ulcer were not admitted to the treated group.&quot;</span>
2. Reasoning: The trial excludes patients with certain conditions such as diabetes mellitus, hypertension, psychiatric illness, or peptic ulcer. This suggests that the trial is not fully representative of the general population that might receive the intervention in a real-world setting, making it more explanatory.
3. Score: [2]

Recruitment:
1. Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Patients with multiple sclerosis were randomly selected into treated and control groups.&quot;</span>
2. Reasoning: The trial uses random selection to recruit participants, which is not a method typically used in usual care. This suggests a more explanatory approach to recruitment.
3. Score: [2]

Setting:
1. Quote: <span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 97.8%):

2. Reasoning: The trial is conducted in three different cities, which suggests a more pragmatic approach as it increases the generalizability of the results. However, the full text does not provide enough information about the specific settings within these cities (e.g., hospital, community clinic, etc.).
3. Score: [4]

Organisation:
1. Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The treated group were given corticotrophin (’ Acthar ’ gel) in a dosage which varied between 15 and 25 units daily, potassium chloride orally, and a low-salt diet.&quot;</span>
2. Reasoning: The trial requires specific resources (corticotrophin, potassium chloride, low-salt diet) and likely requires specific expertise to administer the intervention. This suggests a more explanatory approach as it may not reflect the resources and expertise available in usual care.
3. Score: [2]

Flexibility (Delivery):
1.

2. Reasoning: The trial protocol specifies how the intervention should be delivered and adjusted, suggesting a more explanatory approach as it may not reflect the flexibility in delivery that would be present in usual care.
3. Score: [2]

Flexibility (Adherence):
1. Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;All cases were seen at three-monthly intervals and scored on the Kurtzke (1961) scale; relapses lasting longer than twenty-four hours were also scored by a system in the three centres.&quot;</span>
2. Reasoning: The trial protocol specifies how often patients should be seen and how their condition should be scored, suggesting a more explanatory approach as it may not reflect the flexibility in adherence that would be present in usual care.
3. Score: [2]

Follow-up:
1. Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;All cases were seen at three-monthly intervals and scored on the Kurtzke (1961) scale; relapses lasting longer than twenty-four hours were also scored by a system in the three centres.&quot;</span>
2. Reasoning: The trial protocol specifies a follow-up schedule that may be more frequent than what would typically occur under usual care, suggesting a more explanatory approach.

Primary Outcome:
1. Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;There was no evidence that treatment prevented deterioration or reduced the number or severity of the relapses when compared with 169 control patients observed and scored in a similar way for the same period of time.&quot;</span>
2. Reasoning: The primary outcome of the trial is the prevention of deterioration and reduction in the number or severity of relapses, which are outcomes that are likely to be relevant to patients.
3. Score: [5]

Primary Analysis:
1. Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The total results were obtained by adding the results from the three cities; this was considered justifiable since the methods of selection, treatment, and scoring were essentially the same.&quot;</span>
2. Reasoning: The trial uses an intention-to-treat analysis, which includes all data and is a more pragmatic approach.

2. Reasoning: The trial includes patients with a definite diagnosis of MS who are experiencing a relapse. This suggests that the trial is somewhat pragmatic as it includes a broad range of patients who would typically receive this intervention in a usual care setting. However, the requirement for a definite diagnosis may exclude some patients who would receive the intervention in usual care but do not meet the strict diagnostic criteria used in the trial.
3. Score: [4]

Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Despite great medical advances that have resulted in several available disease-modifying treatments, no approved pharmacological treatment specific for cognitive impairment in MS exists.&quot;</span>
- <span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 99%):

6 Study limitations include that despite being a longterm exercise study, cognitive performance was a secondary outcome (the main RCT was powered toward brain volumetric changes), and thus, the present study merely classifies as a pilot/explorative study in regard to cognitive performance outcome' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;Study limitations include that despite being a long-term exercise study, cognitive performance was a secondary outcome (the main RCT was powered toward brain volumetric changes), and thus, the present study merely classifies as a pilot/explorative study in regard to cognitive performance outcomes.&quot;</span>

Reasoning:
The study includes patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) who have cognitive impairment, a common symptom of MS. However, the study does not specify any further eligibility criteria, such as age, disease severity, or comorbidities. The study seems to be inclusive of a broad range of MS patients, but without specific details, it's difficult to assess how closely the trial population represents the general MS population.

Score: [NA]

2. Recruitment

Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Eighty-six participants were recruited from Danish MS clinics (Aarhus University Hospital, Viborg Regional Hospital, Odense University Hospital, and the MS Clinic of Southern Jutland (Kolding)).&quot;</span>

Reasoning:
The study recruited participants from multiple MS clinics, which suggests a pragmatic approach to recruitment. However, the full text does not provide details on the recruitment process, such as whether participants were recruited through usual appointments or if additional recruitment strategies were used.

Score: [NA]

3. Setting

Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;This was a 24-week randomized controlled cross-over trial.&quot;</span>

Reasoning:
The trial was conducted over 24 weeks, but the full text does not provide specific details about the setting of the trial, such as whether it took place in a clinical or community setting. Without this information, it's difficult to assess how closely the trial setting matches the usual care setting for MS patients.

Score: [NA]

4. Organisation

Quotes:
- <span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 99.5%):

The PAE group underwent supervised highintensity PAE for 24 weeks, while the waitlist group continued their habitual lifestyle (including ongoing physiotherapy treatment) without commencing PAE.' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;The PAE group underwent supervised high-intensity PAE for 24 weeks, while the waitlist group continued their habitual lifestyle (including ongoing physiotherapy treatment) without commencing PAE.&quot;</span>

Reasoning:
The intervention was delivered by the trial team, which suggests a more explanatory approach to organisation. However, the full text does not provide details on the resources and expertise required to deliver the intervention, making it difficult to assess this domain.

Score: [NA]

5. Flexibility (delivery)

Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Supervised PAE sessions were conducted twice weekly during the 24 weeks, with one continuous and one interval exercise session performed each week.&quot;</span>

Reasoning:
The intervention was delivered according to a strict protocol, with supervised sessions conducted twice weekly. This suggests a more explanatory approach to flexibility in delivery, as the intervention was not adapted to individual participants' needs or preferences.

Score: [2]

6. Flexibility (adherence)

Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Exercise adherence was high with 44.8 ± 2.6 completed sessions, corresponding to 93.3 ± 5.4% of the planned sessions.&quot;</span>

Reasoning:
The study monitored adherence to the intervention, but it does not appear that participants were excluded or penalized for non-adherence. This suggests a somewhat pragmatic approach to flexibility in adherence.

Score: [4]

7. Follow-up

Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;At baseline (T0), after 24 (T24) and after 48 (T48) weeks, participants performed the BRB-N, the Major Depression Inventory (MDI), and a cardiorespiratory fitness test (VO2-max test).&quot;</span>

Reasoning:
The study included follow-up assessments at 24 and 48 weeks, which suggests a more explanatory approach to follow-up. However, the frequency of follow-up visits is not specified, making it difficult to assess this domain fully.

Score: [NA]

8. Primary outcome

Quotes:
- <span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 98.9%):

To our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate cognitive performance outcomes in pwMS in a longitudinal RCT following 24 weeks of supervised highintensity PAE intervention' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;To our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate cognitive performance outcomes in pwMS in a longitudinal RCT following 24 weeks of supervised high-intensity PAE intervention.&quot;</span>

Reasoning:
The primary outcome of the study was cognitive performance, which is highly relevant to participants with MS. This suggests a pragmatic approach to the choice of primary outcome.

Score: [5]

9. Primary analysis

Quotes:
- <span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 98.5%):

All longitudinal data for the total group and the cognitively impaired subgroup were analyzed using an intention-to-treat linear mixed effects model with time and group as the factors of interest.' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;All longitudi nal data for the total group and the cognitively impaired subgroup were analyzed using an intention-to-treat lin ear mixed effects model with time and group as the fac tors of interest.&quot;</span>

Reasoning:

1. Eligibility criteria
- Quote: <span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 99.5%):

a Men and women aged 18–65 years with relapsing forms of MS, as defined by the 2005 revised McDonald criteria [14], and an Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) Calkwood et al. BMC Neurology 2014, 14:220 Page 2 of 11 http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2377/14/220 score of 0–5.5 were eligible to participate in the study. Patients were required to have received a single iDMT (except natalizumab) continuously for at least 6 months prior to study initiation and to be candidates for therapy chang' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;Men and women aged 18–65 years with relapsing forms of MS, as defined by the 2005 revised McDonald criteria [14], and an Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score of 0–5.5 were eligible to participate in the study. Patients were required to have received a single iDMT (except natalizumab) continuously for at least 6 months prior to study initiation and to be candidates for therapy change.&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The eligibility criteria for this trial are quite specific and may not reflect the full range of patients who would receive this intervention in a usual care setting. The trial only includes patients with relapsing forms of MS, who have a specific EDSS score, and who have been on a single iDMT for at least 6 months. This suggests a more explanatory approach to the trial design.
- Score: [2]

2. Recruitment
- Quote: <span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 98.8%):

s Study enrollment was completed in October 2011. Of 1053 patients randomized to treatment, 790 were randomized to fingolimod 0.5 mg and 263 were randomized to an iDM' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;Study enrollment was completed in October 2011. Of 1053 patients randomized to treatment, 790 were randomized to fingolimod 0.5 mg and 263 were randomized to an iDMT.&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The text does not provide specific details on how participants were recruited into the trial. Therefore, it is not possible to assess the pragmatism of the recruitment strategy based on the provided information.
- Score: [NA]

3. Setting
- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;EPOC was a 6-month, randomized, open-label, multicenter, phase 4 study conducted in the USA and Canada.&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The trial was conducted in multiple centers across the USA and Canada, which suggests a more pragmatic approach as it likely reflects a variety of usual care settings. However, the text does not provide further details about the specific types of settings (e.g., urban vs. rural, academic vs. community hospitals), which could influence the score.
- Score: [4]

4. Organisation
- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Patients randomized to the iDMT group either remained on the same therapy or, following consultation with a physician, were switched immediately to another approved iDMT.&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The organization of the trial appears to be somewhat flexible, with patients having the option to switch to another approved iDMT following consultation with a physician. However, the text does not provide further details about the resources and expertise required to deliver the intervention, which could influence the score.
- Score: [NA]

5. Flexibility (delivery)
- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Patients were randomized 3:1 to switch to fingolimod or remain on iDMT for 6 months with no intervening washout period.&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The trial design allows for some flexibility in the delivery of the intervention, with patients having the option to switch to fingolimod or remain on their current iDMT. However, the text does not provide further details about the specific protocols for delivering the intervention, which could influence the score.
- Score: [NA]

6. Flexibility (adherence)
- Quote: <span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 97.1%):

. Missing data were imputed using the last observation carried forwar' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;Missing data were imputed using the last observation carried forward.&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The text does not provide specific details on how adherence to the intervention was measured or managed in the trial. The use of the last observation carried forward to impute missing data suggests some flexibility in handling non-adherence, but it is not clear how this compares to usual care.
- Score: [NA]

7. Follow-up
- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;All outcomes were evaluated after 6 months of treatment.&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The follow-up period in this trial is relatively short and fixed at 6 months. This may not reflect the variability in follow-up periods that would be seen in a usual care setting, suggesting a more explanatory approach to the trial design.
- Score: [2]

8. Primary outcome
- Quote: <span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 98.9%):

t The primary post hoc study endpoint was the least-squares mean (LSM) change in Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire for Medication (TSQM) Global Satisfaction score from baseline to 6 month' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;The primary post hoc study endpoint was the least-squares mean (LSM) change in Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire for Medication (TSQM) Global Satisfaction score from baseline to 6 months.&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The primary outcome of the trial is patient-reported treatment satisfaction, which is highly relevant to patients and likely to be a key outcome in usual care. This suggests a more pragmatic approach to the trial design.
- Score: [5]

9. Primary analysis
- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;For the primary endpoint, enrollment of 1000 patients (750 fingolimod; 250 iDMT) would provide 90% power to detect a significant difference between fingolimod and each iDMT group in the change from baseline, assuming an effect size of 0.25, a significance level of 5% and a 10% rate of unevaluable patients.&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The primary analysis plan for the trial appears to be fairly standard and likely to be applicable in a usual care setting. However, the text does not provide specific details about how all data were included in the analysis, which could influence the score.
- Score: [NA]</pre>

Eligibility Criteria:
- Quote: <span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 99.5%):

Forty-two relapsing-remitting MS patients (23 women and 19 men) volunteered to participate in the study. All participants were recruited among six MS rehabilitation centers within the region of Castilla y Le´on (Spain). After a group meeting where the details of the investigation were described to the patients, including possible risks and discomfort associated to the intervention, a formal invitation to take part in the study was offered. The patient inclusion criteria included a confirmed disease diagnosis by a neurologist, accord C. Medina-Perez et al. / Effects of a RTP and subsequent detraining on muscle strength and muscle power in MS patients 525 Table 1 Demographic data at baseline Exercise group Control group P-values (n = 30) (n = 12) Age (yr) 49.6 ± 11.0 46.2 ± 7.5 0.395 Weight (Kg) 68.1 ± 11.4 63.3 ± 12.0 0.177 Height (cm) 165.0 ± 8.3 162.8 ± 6.0 0.485 BMI (Kg/m 2 ) 25.0 ± 4.1 24.0 ± 4.9 0.200 EDSS 4.5 ± 2.1 4.1 ± 0.5 0.380 Time since diagnosis (yr) 11.3 ± 6.1 12.2 ± 4.5 0.570 Data are given as mean ± SD.

After a group meeting where the details of the investigation were described to the patients, including possible risks and discomfort associated with the intervention, a formal invitation to take part in the study was offered. The patient inclusion criteria included a confirmed disease diagnosis by a neurologist, according to Mc-Donald criteria (McDonald, 2001); ability to walk (with or without aid) at least 20 m without rest; absence of other diseases that might have affected muscle function.&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The study included patients with relapsing-remitting MS who were able to walk at least 20 meters without rest and did not have other diseases that might affect muscle function. This suggests that the trial was somewhat selective in its inclusion criteria, potentially excluding patients with more severe forms of MS or those with comorbidities that could affect muscle function. However, the criteria still seem relatively broad and likely representative of a significant portion of the MS population.
- Score: [4]

Recruitment:
- Quote: <span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 99.1%):

All participants were recruited among six MS rehabilitation centers within the region of Castilla y Le´on (Spain). After a group meeting where the details of the investigation were described to the patients, including possible risks and discomfort associated to the intervention, a formal invitation to take part in the study was offered.' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;All participants were recruited among six MS rehabilitation centers within the region of Castilla y Le´on (Spain). After a group meeting where the details of the investigation were described to the patients, including possible risks and discomfort associated with the intervention, a formal invitation to take part in the study was offered.&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The recruitment process involved inviting patients from six MS rehabilitation centers to participate in the study. This suggests that the recruitment process was somewhat pragmatic, as it involved recruiting patients from existing care settings. However, the recruitment process may not fully reflect usual care, as it involved a formal invitation to participate in the study after a group meeting.
- Score: [4]

Setting:
- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;All training sessions took place in MS rehabilitation centers and the patients were continuously supervised by physical therapists.&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The trial was conducted in MS rehabilitation centers, which are likely to be representative of the settings where the intervention would be applied in usual care. This suggests a pragmatic approach to the setting of the trial.
- Score: [5]

Organization:
- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Subjects performed coupled concentric-eccentric bilateral seated knee extension training using a weight stack machine (BH ® Fitness Nevada Pro-T, Spain) twice per week during 12 weeks, with at least 48 h of rest between sessions.&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The intervention required specific equipment (a weight stack machine) and was delivered twice per week over 12 weeks. This suggests that the organization of the intervention was somewhat explanatory, as it required specific resources and a structured schedule that may not be available or feasible in usual care.
- Score: [3]

Flexibility (Delivery):
- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Subjects were requested to push with maximal effort during the concentric phase of the movement (90–180◦) and to lower the load (eccentric action; 180–90◦) in a controlled manner.&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The intervention was delivered in a highly structured manner, with specific instructions on how to perform the exercises. This suggests a more explanatory approach to the delivery of the intervention.
- Score: [2]

Flexibility (Adherence):
- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Adherence to the training intervention (e.g. EG) averaged 22.9 ± 1.5 sessions from a total of 24 planned sessions. All participants from the EG completed more than 75% of the sessions included in the resistance training program.&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The trial required a high level of adherence to the intervention, with participants expected to attend almost all of the planned sessions. This suggests a more explanatory approach to adherence.
- Score: [2]

Follow-Up:
- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Testing was performed on three different occasions: before (week 0) and after (week 12) the training program, and after the detraining period (week 24).&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The follow-up schedule involved three testing occasions over a 24-week period. This suggests a somewhat explanatory approach to follow-up, as it involves more frequent and structured follow-up than might occur in usual care.
- Score: [3]

Primary Outcome:

- Reasoning: The primary outcomes of the trial were measures of muscle strength and function, which are likely to be highly relevant to patients with MS. This suggests a pragmatic approach to the choice of primary outcome.
- Score: [5]

Primary Analysis:
- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;To assess any training or detraining effect, as well as any difference between groups, MVIC, torque, average power and muscle endurance raw values were examined using two-way ANOVA with repeated measurements for group and time.&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The primary analysis included all available data and used a statistical method (two-way ANOVA) that accounts for the effects of both group and time. This suggests a pragmatic approach to the primary analysis.

# The nine domains of PRECIS-2

## 1. Eligibility criteria: Who is selected to participate in the trial?

A highly pragmatic approach to eligibility criteria would be to include in the trial anyone with the condition of interest who is likely to be a candidate for the intervention if it was being provided in usual care for this condition. So, if in usual care the intervention would likely be used for children, elderly people, people with a range of comorbidities, and people with a probable diagnosis rather than, say, a laboratory confirmed diagnosis, then all of these groups should be in the trial too. If people aged over 80 or with multiple morbidities would not receive the intervention in usual care because we already know that this intervention does more harm than good in elderly or multi-morbid patients, then a pragmatic design choice would be to exclude them from the trial. A trial with eligibility design choices like this would score at or close to 5 on the PRECIS-2 scale.

As the level of similarity between the people in the trial and those in usual care decreases, then so would the PRECIS-2 score. Many things could reduce the score, but some examples include

* Excluding people not known or shown to be highly adherent to the intervention.
* Excluding people using tests or measures that are not used or available in usual care.
* Excluding people not expected to be highly responsive to the intervention.
* Excluding people who would be likely to receive the intervention in usual care but inclusion in the trial is considered too difficult because of challenges unrelated to the delivery of the intervention. Children, people over the age of 65, and pregnant women are good examples of people commonly excluded because of anticipated difficulties of gaining ethical approval rather than whether they would be likely to receive an intervention in usual care.
* Excluding people whose adherence and follow-up may pose difficulties, whether because of social disadvantage, personal circumstances, or illness (such as homelessness, substance misuse, mental health problems, or poor motivation).
* Excluding people dependent on help for activities of daily living, unless they would usually not be eligible for intervention.

Finally, exclusion criteria for known safety issues would not generally reduce the PRECIS-2 score since such individuals would not be expected to get the intervention in usual care.

## 2. Recruitment: How are participants recruited into the trial?

This domain has been included to encourage trialists to consider how and where they will recruit people to their trial.

The most extreme pragmatic approach to recruitment would be to do this in usual care so that only the people who attend a clinic with the condition of interest are recruited after they present on their own behalf without any overt recruitment effort. A highly pragmatic approach to trial design would also recruit from more than one clinic as an explicit way of increasing applicability of the trial results. Recruiting through usual appointments at a diverse range of clinics is likely to score at or close to 5 on the PRECIS-2 scale.

If the above is not feasible, at least as the sole recruitment route, trialists will need to add other recruitment strategies. If extra resources will be required to recruit people to the trial, trialists need to consider if this affects applicability, especially if participants are recruited from settings other than the one in which the results are likely to be applied. For example, recruiting in secondary care for an intervention that will mainly be used in primary care will ensure that the recruited patients are different in severity and treatment than the patients with this same condition in primary care; and so this will make the trial more explanatory and reduce the PRECIS 2 score. Additional recruitment approaches that could potentially reduce the PRECIS-2 score include

* Searching medical record systems for eligible participants and then mailing invitation letters. Depending on local resources, such as electronic medical records and comprehensive local disease registers, this approach may be easily achievable in usual care and so would not reduce the PRECIS-2 score.
* Media advertising campaigns such as television and radio advertisements, newspaper advertisements, flyers, websites, press releases, letters to the editor, interviews with the chief investigator on television or radio. The issue to consider here is whether these campaigns are being used simply to speed up recruitment, or because they are the only way to reach a dispersed population. In the latter case, if such campaigns would not be available in usual care then this trial recruitment route is more explanatory.
* Incentives such as cash payment, vouchers, travel costs, or childcare. Some of these incentives may be better considered as part of the intervention (for example, a lifestyle change intervention aimed at new mothers may only be effective because childcare was also provided and women could therefore attend sessions).

## 3. Setting: Where is the trial being done?

This domain has been included to encourage trialists to explicitly consider the match between the setting of their trial and the setting where their results are likely to be applied. While there are no accepted guidelines for how to assess the impact of setting on applicability, there are several characteristics of the setting that will almost always need to be considered, including geography, healthcare system, country, and the socioeconomic and ethnic mix of the population. All of these might affect the applicability of results from a particular trial.

The most extremely pragmatic approach to setting would be to do the trial in an identical setting to which you intend the results to be applied. Such a trial is likely to score at or close to 5 on PRECIS-2.

Even settings that seem rather restrictive could still be a highly pragmatic design choice if this setting is the usual care setting where patients are treated for the particular health condition. For example, if a trial was carried out in the most specialist intensive care units in the country and the intention of the trial was to support decision making in these highly specialised units, then the design choice with regard to setting is still pragmatic. Conversely, if the trial results were intended to be useful for all intensive care units, but the trial included only highly specialised units, then the trial is now taking a more explanatory approach to the choice of setting that goes against the intention of the trial.

Approaches to setting that are likely to reduce the PRECIS-2 score include

* Selecting participating centres from among only specialist or academic centres when the trial is intended to be applicable to all types of practice or clinic treating the condition of interest.
* Running the trial in a single centre. It is rare that a trial is done with the intention that its results should apply to only that single centre. Including several centres makes it easier to claim that the trial setting matches that to which the results will be applied.

## 4. Organisation: What expertise and resources are needed to deliver the intervention?

This domain has been included to encourage trialists to consider the match between how care is organised and delivered in the trial and how the intervention would be made available to patients in usual care. As there have been acknowledged difficulties in implementing results post-trial (even in settings where the trial was conducted), we wanted trialists to consider organising the delivery of their trial intervention with an awareness of how easy it would be to implement the intervention post-trial .

A highly pragmatic design would aim to slot the intervention into the usual organisation of care for the condition of interest, making use of no more than the existing healthcare staff and resources in that setting. A design like this is likely to score at or close to 5 on PRECIS-2.

Sometimes a change to how care is organised is itself the intervention being evaluated, and the difference between the trial and usual care is clear. In this case the organisation domain would be explanatory compared with current usual care, but trialists can note that the difference is an explicit feature of the intervention.

The PRECIS-2 organisation score will be reduced to the degree trialists make changes in how care is delivered compared with the usual recipients and care delivery. For example, the trial team may, in the intervention arm, provide additional training to staff or provide additional staff so that the intervention can be delivered. Patients who would normally be seen in primary care may be seen by specialists in secondary care instead, or they may receive additional expensive diagnostic procedures unavailable in usual care. The success or otherwise of the trial then depends on resources unavailable in usual care, reducing applicability. If these additional resources are essential to the effectiveness of the intervention they should be considered to be part of the intervention and be specified in the part of the protocol describing the intervention. In that case these resources should not be counted when this element of the trial is judged.

Organisational approaches that are likely to reduce the PRECIS-2 score include the following (but only when they are not incorporated and described as necessary elements of the intervention):

* Increasing the number of healthcare or other professionals available to deliver the intervention over and above the levels available in usual care.
* Providing significant levels of additional training to increase the expertise of healthcare professionals.
* Requiring healthcare professionals to have some minimum level of experience, defined by length of time, in working with the intervention that is greater than would be the case in usual care.
* Requiring healthcare professionals to have a specialty certification that would not be considered essential to deliver the intervention in usual care.
* Increasing the resources (such as facilities, diagnostic equipment, consumables) available to deliver the intervention, measure outcomes, or do follow-up over and above what would be available in usual care.

## 5. Flexibility (delivery): How should the intervention be delivered?

In PRECIS-2, trialists wishing to conduct more pragmatic trials are encouraged to think about how the intervention will be implemented post-trial in the setting where the results are expected to be applied. The most pragmatic design approach to delivery flexibility would leave the details of how to implement the intervention up to providers, in other words, what happens in usual care. Thus, the methodology of how to deliver an intervention is not rigidly prescriptive in the protocol. For example, the details of how to perform a surgical procedure could be left entirely to the surgeon, or how to deliver an educational programme is left to the discretion of the educator. Additionally, a pragmatic approach would not dictate which other interventions were permitted, or how to deliver them, which again is the situation in usual practice. This sort of delivery flexibility would score at or close to 5 on PRECIS-2. Flexibility (delivery) applies to all intervention arms and the comparator (control) arm if usual care is not the comparator, and if necessary each of these arms will need to be scored separately. If usual care is the intended comparator but any elements relating to delivery are changed it ceases to be usual care and needs to be scored.

As delivery flexibility is reduced, the trial moves towards a more explanatory approach in this domain. Approaches to delivery flexibility that are likely to reduce the PRECIS-2 score include

* A highly specified, protocol driven intervention. For example, specific direction is given for how to the administer the intervention (such as dose, dosing schedule, surgical procedures, educational material, and delivery)
* Having measures in place to monitor the compliance of those delivering the intervention (such as doctors) with the protocol and measures (up to and including exclusion) to address poor compliance.
* The timing of intervention delivery is tightly defined and designed to maximise the intervention effect.
* Providers undertake additional interventions that would not occur in usual care
* Restrictions are placed on the number and types of co-interventions, particularly if excluded co-interventions would dilute any intervention effect
* There is specific direction for applying permitted co-interventions
* There are specific directions for managing complications or side effects of the intervention.

## 6. Flexibility (adherence): What measures are in place to ensure participants adhere to the intervention?

It is important that trialists focused on applicability consider how probable it is that there will be uptake of the intervention being tested and how recipients will engage with it in the setting in which it will be later applied. A highly pragmatic design approach would allow for full flexibility in how end user recipients engage with the intervention. In usual care, health professionals encourage patients to take medication or follow therapy as best they can, and such encouragement would not count against a pragmatic design; if it also happens in usual care, allowing it in the trial is a pragmatic design decision. A trial with no special measures to enforce engagement or compliance would score at or close to 5 on PRECIS-2. On the other hand, a trial protocol that lays out methods to monitor and ensure patient compliance would score at or close to 1 on PRECIS-2. Flexibility (adherence) applies to all intervention arms and the comparator (control) arm if usual care if not the comparator, and if necessary each of these arms will need to be scored separately. If usual care is the intended comparator but any elements relating to adherence are changed it ceases to be usual care and needs to be scored.

It is possible that improving recipients’ ability to take medication or follow therapy is the intervention under evaluation, a situation similar to that already described for the Setting and Organisation domains. In this case, the Flexibility (adherence) domain would be explanatory compared with current usual care, but trialists can note that the difference is an explicit feature of the intervention.

As flexibility for recipients is reduced, the trial moves towards a more explanatory approach on this domain. Approaches to recipient flexibility that are likely to reduce the PRECIS-2 score include

* Having a trial pre-screening stage where patients are evaluated for adherence with the intervention (such as dose, dosing schedule, attendance at therapy sessions). Patients judged to not be adherent are excluded.
* Withdrawing patients from the trial if their adherence with the intervention drops below some specified level. For example, a trial might withdraw patients if they failed to attend two consecutive sessions of cognitive behavioural therapy or failed to take more than 90% of their medication.
* Having measures in place to monitor patient adherence with the protocol and measures (up to and including withdrawal) to address poor adherence. Measures to increase patient adherence should this fall below some specified level could, for example, include scheduling an extra discussion with a research nurse about why following the trial instructions is important.

## 7. Follow-up: How closely are participants followed up?

This domain encourages trialists to think about follow-up with regard to the setting where the results will be applied. The most pragmatic position with regard to follow-up would be to have no more follow-up of recipients than would be the case in usual care. Indeed, the most extreme position is to have no follow-up contact at all with recipients and to obtain outcome data by other means (such as electronic medical records or other usual data to measure mortality or hospital admissions). Trials that have no more follow-up than is normal in usual care and have minimal additional data collection (or use data obtained from administrative or clinical record systems without direct contact with the participant) would be likely to score at or close to 5 on PRECIS-2.

As follow-up becomes more intense, the trial becomes more explanatory and the PRECIS-2 score will decrease. Follow-up approaches that are likely to reduce the PRECIS-2 score include

* Follow-up visits that are more frequent than would typically occur under usual care.
* Unscheduled follow-up visits are triggered by a primary outcome event.
* Unscheduled follow-up visits are triggered by an intervening event that is likely to lead to the primary outcome event.
* Patients are contacted if they fail to keep trial appointments. This would not reduce the PRECIS-2 score if this was also done in usual care.
* More extensive data are collected, particularly intervention related data, than would be typical outside the trial
* Visits are longer than usual care and involve additional or different staff.

Often the required trial outcomes may be obtained only through contact with the recipients. Even in the “no follow-up” approach, assessment of outcomes may be achieved with a single follow-up at the end of the study. The end of study would need to be defined so that there is sufficient time for the desired study outcomes (see Primary outcome domain below) to be observed. When the follow-up is done in this way, it is unlikely to have an impact on engagement or response to the treatment, and so such a follow-up approach would be viewed as pragmatic and rated at or close to 5.

It is often the case that explanatory trials are interested in the effect of an intervention only during a brief intervention period or shortly after. On the other hand, trials taking a pragmatic approach to design may follow recipients well beyond the intervention period. This longer period of follow-up may require more contacts than would be the case in usual care, but this need not be inconsistent with a pragmatic approach if it does not result in care management that differs from the usual conditions. It is, however, important to consider the burden of follow-up for participants.

## 8. Primary outcome: How relevant is it to participants?

The choice of primary outcome is a crucial trial design decision, and a pragmatic approach would be to select an outcome that is of obvious importance from the patient’s perspective. Post-trial, an outcome selected using a pragmatic approach would also be relevant to commissioners of care, the people who decide whether to implement the intervention on the basis of its results. For example, an intervention that aims to reduce falls in elderly people living independently in the community should have as its primary outcome the number of falls in the elderly living independently in the community. This outcome has meaning to patients, their relatives and friends, healthcare professionals, and policymakers. Measures of, say, bone density, muscle strength, or functional ability are distant from the key question of whether the intervention prevents elderly people falling in their own homes. Trials that choose outcomes of obvious importance to patients, and measure them in a way that is the same or similar to the way they are measured in usual care would be likely to score at or close to 5 on PRECIS-2.

As the primary outcome becomes less recognisably important to patients, or is assessed on criteria seldom used in usual care, the trial becomes more explanatory and the PRECIS-2 score will decrease. Approaches to the primary outcomes that are likely to reduce the PRECIS-2 score include

* Choosing a surrogate outcome (such as blood test) that the intervention is expected to have a direct effect on, or the use of safety climate surveys rather than medical error events or near miss events.
* Using a composite primary outcome in which some of the elements are less important to patients or participants than others (such as incidence of death, stroke, myocardial infarction, or renal dysfunction at 30 days).
* Having central adjudication of the outcome or using an assessment that needs special training or tests not normally used in usual care.
* Choosing an outcome that is important but mainly to providers, typically because it is a physiological outcome considered useful in treatment planning and monitoring.
* Measuring an outcome that is important but at a time that is earlier than would be normal in usual care. For example, stroke could be a primary outcome in trials making explanatory or pragmatic design choices. However, time horizons may vary from short term after a one-time intervention (more explanatory) to long term (more pragmatic).

## 9. Primary analysis: To what extent are all data included?

Most trials are a superiority design so the most pragmatic approach with regard to the analysis would be to make no special allowance in the analysis for non-adherence, practice variability, etc. In other words, the pragmatic approach to the analysis would typically be an intention-to-treat analysis using all available data. This sort of analysis would score at or close to 5 on PRECIS-2. (Non-inferiority and equivalence trials are usually contrary to intention-to-treat analysis.)

The intention-to-treat analysis has recently also become the norm for superiority trials taking a more explanatory design approach, especially when regulatory approval for an intervention is being sought. The most explanatory approach would be to use the “as treated analysis” as the primary analysis, in which only those patients who actually received (or did not receive) the intervention would be analysed in the intervention and control groups respectively, irrespective of their initial randomised group allocation.

Other causes of missing data may be important but may not affect how pragmatic or explanatory a trial is. Systematic exclusion of data from participants because, say, they were poorly adherent would make a trial more explanatory. Using all data but doing nothing to try and fill gaps caused by missing data would not in itself make trial more pragmatic or explanatory; missing data, especially if there is a lot of it, makes any conclusions more uncertain regardless of the design approach taken.

Approaches to the primary analysis that are likely to reduce the PRECIS-2 score include

* Excluding non-compliant recipients (per protocol analysis)
* Analyse recipients to treatment received instead of treatment randomised (as treated analysis)
* Excluding data from non-adherent providers
* Excluding data from trial sites or providers who recruit below expected volume.

For some trials taking an explanatory approach (dose finding trials are an example), it may be appropriate to have primary analysis restricted in the ways mentioned; otherwise such restricted analyses of the primary outcome could be pre-planned as secondary analyses of the primary outcome.

# PRECIS-2 Domains
* Eligibility: To what extent are the participants in the trial similar to those who would receive this intervention if it was part of usual care? For example, score 5 for very pragmatic criteria essentially identical to those in usual care; score 1 for a very explanatory approach with lots of exclusions (e.g. those who don’t comply, respond to treatment, or are not at high risk for primary outcome, are children or elderly), or uses many selection tests not used in usual care.
* Recruitment: How much extra effort is made to recruit participants over and above what that would be used in the usual care setting to engage with patients? For example, score 5 for very pragmatic recruitment through usual appointments or clinic; score 1 for a very explanatory approach with targeted invitation letters, advertising in newspapers, radio plus incentives and other routes that would not be used in usual care.
* Setting: How different is the setting of the trial and the usual care setting? For example, score 5 for a very pragmatic choice using identical settings to usual care; score 1, for a very explanatory approach with only a single centre, or only specialised trial or academic centres.
* Organisation: How different are the resources, provider expertise and the organisation of care delivery in the intervention arm of the trial and those available in usual care? For example, score 5 for a very pragmatic choice that uses identical organisation to usual care; score 1 for a very explanatory approach if the trial increases staff levels, gives additional training, require more than usual experience or certification and increase resources.
* Flexibility (delivery): How different is the flexibility in how the intervention is delivered and the flexibility likely in usual care? For example, score 5 for a very pragmatic choice with identical flexibility to usual care; score 1 for a very explanatory approach if there is a strict protocol, monitoring and measures to improve compliance, with specific advice on allowed co-interventions and complications.
* Flexibility (adherence): How different is the flexibility in how participants must adhere to the intervention and the flexibility likely in usual care? For example, score 5 for a very pragmatic choice involving no more than usual encouragement to adhere to the intervention; score 1 for a very explanatory approach that involves exclusion based on adherence, and measures to improve adherence if found wanting. In some trials eg surgical trials where patients are being operated on or Intensive Care Unit trials where patients are being given IV drug therapy, this domain is not applicable as there is no compliance issue after consent has been given, so this score should be left blank.
* Follow-up: How different is the intensity of measurement and follow-up of participants in the trial and the likely follow-up in usual care? For example, score 5 for a very pragmatic approach with no more than usual follow up; score 1 for a very explanatory approach with more frequent, longer visits, unscheduled visits triggered by primary outcome event or intervening event, and more extensive data collection.
* Primary outcome: To what extent is the trial's primary outcome relevant to participants? For example, score 5 for a very pragmatic choice where the outcome is of obvious importance to participants; score 1 for a very explanatory approach using a surrogate, physiological outcome, central adjudication or use assessment expertise that is not available in usual care, or the outcome is measured at an earlier time than in usual care.
* Primary analysis: To what extent are all data included in the analysis of the primary outcome? For example, score 5 for a very pragmatic approach using intention to treat with all available data; score 1 for a very explanatory analysis that excludes ineligible post-randomisation participants, includes only completers or those following the treatment protocol.
