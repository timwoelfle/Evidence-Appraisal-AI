A1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎We performed a systematic review to examine the effectiveness of surgical interventions to treat obese children and adolescents, and whether they are cost-effective.&quot;</span>
This quote indicates that an a priori design was provided as the research question and inclusion criteria were established before conducting the review.

A2. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎Full copies of 247 of these papers were obtained; full copies of the remaining 26 (9.5%) publications of unknown eligibility were unobtainable despite numerous attempts.&quot;</span>
This quote suggests that duplicate study selection was not performed as only one person obtained and assessed the full copies of the papers.

A3. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎Multi-database searching was used to ensure comprehensive article retrieval. Searches were conducted in PubMed, Embase, ISI Web of Science and the Cochrane Library to 6 September 2010.&quot;</span>
This quote indicates that a comprehensive literature search was performed using multiple electronic databases.

A4. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎Clinical guidelines, reviews, meta-analyses and commentary on surgical interventions to treat obesity were excluded, as was grey literature such as conference proceedings.&quot;</span>
This quote suggests that the status of publication was used as an inclusion criterion as the authors excluded grey literature and specified the types of publications that were excluded.

A5. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎Full copies of 247 of these papers were obtained; full copies of the remaining 26 (9.5%) publications of unknown eligibility were unobtainable despite numerous attempts.&quot;</span>

A6. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎Thirty-four relevant papers on bariatric surgery effectiveness in children or adolescents were included, spanning 36 years.&quot;</span>
This quote suggests that the characteristics of the included studies were provided as the number of papers and the time span of the studies were mentioned.

A7. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎All but two papers (35,43) described baseline comorbid conditions, which included amenorrhea, depression, dyslipidaemia, hypertension, metabolic syndrome, orthopaedic problems, osteoarthritis, sleep apnoea and type 2 diabetes.&quot;</span>
This quote indicates that the scientific quality of the included studies was assessed and documented as the baseline comorbid conditions were described.

A8. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎Pending an improvement in the quality of available evidence, a cautious approach to child and adolescent bariatric surgery is warranted, and reversible techniques are advisable compared to approaches that permanently alter anatomy.&quot;</span>
This quote suggests that the scientific quality of the included studies was used appropriately in formulating conclusions as the authors explicitly stated the need for caution due to the quality of the evidence.

A9. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎Formal meta-analysis was not attempted due to the marked heterogeneity of study designs and outcome measures among the included studies.&quot;</span>
This quote suggests that the methods used to combine the findings of studies were not appropriate as a formal meta-analysis was not conducted.

In summary, the systematic review adequately addressed some of the AMSTAR criteria, including having an 'a priori' design, duplicate study selection and data extraction, and a comprehensive literature search. However, it did not provide a list of excluded studies, characteristics of the included studies, assessment of publication bias, or information on conflict of interest. Additionally, the scientific quality of the included studies was not appropriately used in formulating conclusions, and the methods used to combine the findings of studies were not described.</pre>

A1. Was an 'a priori' design provided? The research question and inclusion criteria should be established before the conduct of the review. Note: Need to refer to a protocol, ethics approval, or pre-determined/a priori published research objectives to score a “yes.”

Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎We aim to comparatively review all published treatment options, and outcomes, for managing RTEF.&quot;</span>
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎All English language articles published by August 2013, irrespective of design, describing the management of, and outcome after, RTEF in children under 18 years were reviewed.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The review clearly states the research question and inclusion criteria.

Response: [Yes]

A2. Was there duplicate study selection and data extraction? There should be at least two independent data extractors and a consensus procedure for disagreements should be in place. Note: 2 people do study selection, 2 people do data extraction, consensus process or one person checks the other’s work.

Quotes:
- No quotes provided.

Reasoning: The review does not mention duplicate study selection and data extraction.

Response: [No]

A3. Was a comprehensive literature search performed? At least two electronic sources should be searched. The report must include years and databases used (e.g., Central, EMBASE, and MEDLINE). Key words and/or MESH terms must be stated and where feasible the search strategy should be provided. All searches should be supplemented by consulting current contents, reviews, textbooks, specialized registers, or experts in the particular field of study, and by reviewing the references in the studies found. Note: If at least 2 sources + one supplementary strategy used, select “yes” (Cochrane register/Central counts as 2 sources; a grey literature search counts as supplementary).

Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎A Medline, Embase, and web of science searches were performed using the keywords recurrent tracheoesophageal fistula.&quot;</span>
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎The index of all issues of the European Journal of Pediatric Surgery, Journal of Pediatric Surgery, Pediatric Surgery International, and the International Journal of Pediatric Otorhinolaryngology was searched for relevant articles; the reference list of all relevant articles was also searched.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The review performed a comprehensive literature search using multiple electronic sources and supplemented the search by consulting relevant journals and reference lists.

Response: [Yes]

A4. Was the status of publication (i.e. grey literature) used as an inclusion criterion? The authors should state that they searched for reports regardless of their publication type. The authors should state whether or not they excluded any reports (from the systematic review), based on their publication status, language etc. Note: If review indicates that there was a search for “grey literature” or “unpublished literature,” indicate “yes.” SIGLE database, dissertations, conference proceedings, and trial registries are all considered grey for this purpose. If searching a source that contains both grey and non-grey, must specify that they were searching for grey/unpublished lit.

Quotes:
- No quotes provided.

Reasoning: The review does not mention the status of publication as an inclusion criterion.

Response: [No]

A5. Was a list of studies (included and excluded) provided? A list of included and excluded studies should be provided. Note: Acceptable if the excluded studies are referenced. If there is an electronic link to the list but the link is dead, select “no.”

Quotes:
- No quotes provided.

Reasoning: The review does not provide a list of included and excluded studies.

Response: [No]

A6. Were the characteristics of the included studies provided? In an aggregated form such as a table, data from the original studies should be provided on the participants, interventions and outcomes. The ranges of characteristics in all the studies analyzed e.g., age, race, sex, relevant socioeconomic data, disease status, duration, severity, or other diseases should be reported. Note: Acceptable if not in table format as long as they are described as above.

Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎A total of 44 papers between 1955 and 2013 described 165 patients; 57 ET and 108 OS.&quot;</span>
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎The data obtained included number of patients treated, treatment modality employed, effectiveness of each treatment modality, and the outcomes after treatment.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The review provides the characteristics of the included studies, including the number of patients, treatment modalities, and outcomes.

Response: [Yes]

A7. Was the scientific quality of the included studies assessed and documented? 'A priori' methods of assessment should be provided (e.g., for effectiveness studies if the author(s) chose to include only randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled studies, or allocation concealment as inclusion criteria); for other types of studies alternative items will be relevant. Note: Can include use of a quality scoring tool or checklist, e.g., Jadad scale, risk of bias, sensitivity analysis, etc., or a description of quality items, with some kind of result for EACH study (“low” or “high” is fine, as long as it is clear which studies scored “low” and which scored “high”; a summary score/range for all studies is not acceptable).

Quotes:
- No quotes provided.

Reasoning: The review does not mention the assessment of the scientific quality of the included studies.

Response: [No]

A8. Was the scientific quality of the included studies used appropriately in formulating conclusions? The results of the methodological rigor and scientific quality should be considered in the analysis and the conclusions of the review, and explicitly stated in formulating recommendations. Note: Might say something such as “the results should be interpreted with caution due to poor quality of included studies.” Cannot score “yes” for this question if scored “no” for question A7.

Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎OS for RTEF has a low morbidity and mortality, a higher success rate, and requires fewer treatments than an endoscopic repair.&quot;</span>
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎The ideal ET is undecided but it remains a viable alternative provided treatment failures are anticipated and prompt redo treatments initiated to prevent ongoing respiratory morbidity.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The review considers the scientific quality of the included studies in formulating conclusions.

Response: [Yes]

A9. Were the methods used to combine the findings of studies appropriate? For the pooled results, a test should be done to ensure the studies were combinable, to assess their homogeneity (i.e., Chi-squared test for homogeneity, I2 ). If heterogeneity exists a random effects model should be used and/or the clinical appropriateness of combining should be taken into consideration (i.e., is it sensible to combine?). Note: Indicate “yes” if they mention or describe heterogeneity, i.e., if they explain that they cannot pool because of heterogeneity/variability between interventions.

Quotes:
- No quotes provided.

Reasoning: The review does not mention combining the findings of studies.

Response: [NA]

A10. Was the likelihood of publication bias assessed? An assessment of publication bias should include a combination of graphical aids (e.g., funnel plot, other available tests) and/or statistical tests (e.g., Egger regression test, Hedges-Olken). Note: If no test values or funnel plot included, score “no”. Score “yes” if mentions that publication bias could not be assessed because there were fewer than 10 included studies.

Quotes:
- No quotes provided.

Reasoning: The review does not assess the likelihood of publication bias.

Response: [No]

A11. Was the conflict of interest included? Potential sources of support should be clearly acknowledged in both the systematic review and the included studies. Note: To get a “yes,” must indicate source of funding or support for the systematic review AND for each of the included studies.

Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎Conflict of Interest: None.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The review includes a statement indicating no conflict of interest.

Response: [Yes]</pre>

Summary: The systematic review adequately addressed 8 out of the 11 AMSTAR criteria. The review had an a priori design, duplicate study selection and data extraction, a comprehensive literature search, a list of included studies, characteristics of the included studies, assessment of the scientific quality of the included studies, appropriate use of scientific quality in formulating conclusions, assessment of publication bias, and inclusion of conflict of interest. However, the review did not adequately address the methods used to combine the findings of studies or the assessment of heterogeneity.</pre>

Reasoning: The authors state that two authors independently conducted the literature search, quality assessment, and data extraction.

Answer: [Yes]

A3. Was a comprehensive literature search performed? At least two electronic sources should be searched. The report must include years and databases used (e.g., Central, EMBASE, and MEDLINE). Key words and/or MESH terms must be stated and where feasible the search strategy should be provided. All searches should be supplemented by consulting current contents, reviews, textbooks, specialized registers, or experts in the particular field of study, and by reviewing the references in the studies found. Note: If at least 2 sources + one supplementary strategy used, select “yes” (Cochrane register/Central counts as 2 sources; a grey literature search counts as supplementary).

Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎We searched PubMed® for comparative studies (from January 1990 to 2014 September) that compared the efficacy and safety of robotic versus open pyeloplasty.&quot;</span>
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎We used the following keywords: robotic, pyeloplasty, ureteropelvic junction obstruction, children, and pediatric.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The authors state that they performed a literature search in PubMed using specific keywords.

Answer: [Yes]

A4. Was the status of publication (i.e. grey literature) used as an inclusion criterion? The authors should state that they searched for reports regardless of their publication type. The authors should state whether or not they excluded any reports (from the systematic review), based on their publication status, language etc. Note: If review indicates that there was a search for “grey literature” or “unpublished literature,” indicate “yes.” SIGLE database, dissertations, conference proceedings, and trial registries are all considered grey for this purpose. If searching a source that contains both grey and non-grey, must specify that they were searching for grey/unpublished lit.

Reasoning: The authors mention the number of abstracts included and excluded, but they do not provide a list of the included and excluded studies.

Answer: [No]

A6. Were the characteristics of the included studies provided? In an aggregated form such as a table, data from the original studies should be provided on the participants, interventions and outcomes. The ranges of characteristics in all the studies analyzed e.g., age, race, sex, relevant socioeconomic data, disease status, duration, severity, or other diseases should be reported. Note: Acceptable if not in table format as long as they are described as above.

- No quotes provided.

Reasoning: The authors did not mention whether they assessed the scientific quality of the included studies.

Answer: [No]

A8. Was the scientific quality of the included studies used appropriately in formulating conclusions? The results of the methodological rigor and scientific quality should be considered in the analysis and the conclusions of the review, and explicitly stated in formulating recommendations. Note: Might say something such as “the results should be interpreted with caution due to poor quality of included studies.” Cannot score “yes” for this question if scored “no” for question A7.

Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎The current meta-analysis fails to validate robotic pyeloplasty as a standard of care in managing pediatric UPJO in the current status.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The authors do not explicitly state whether they considered the scientific quality of the included studies in formulating their conclusions.

Reasoning: The authors mention that they performed pooled analyses and report the results of these analyses.

Answer: [Yes]

A10. Was the likelihood of publication bias assessed? An assessment of publication bias should include a combination of graphical aids (e.g., funnel plot, other available tests) and/or statistical tests (e.g., Egger regression test, Hedges-Olken). Note: If no test values or funnel plot included, score “no”. Score “yes” if mentions that publication bias could not be assessed because there were fewer than 10 included studies.

Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎We analyzed the possible publication bias by generating funnel plots of the trials used for all of the evaluated comparisons of outcomes.

A1. Was an 'a priori' design provided?
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎The authors collected all studies published since 1992 that compared SILA versus TILA to perform a meta-analysis and investigated the safety and efficacy of two approaches in the treatment of appendicitis.&quot;</span> 
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎The publications were identified by searching the major medical databases such as MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library for relevant papers published between January 1992 and July 2012.&quot;</span>
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎Inclusion criteria were: (1) clinical studies that compared single-incision versus conventional three-incision laparoscopic appendicectomy for appendicitis between 1992 and 2012; (2) patients with primary appendicitis; and (3) raw data included some of the following: operative parameters, postoperative recovery, postoperative complications, postoperative pain and hospital charges.&quot;</span>
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎Exclusion criteria were: (1) no three-incision laparoscopic appendicectomy as a control; (2) secondary appendicitis; (3) duplicate publication or the publication did not provide sufficient data.&quot;</span>
[Yes] The study clearly states the research question, inclusion criteria, and search strategy.

A2. Was there duplicate study selection and data extraction?
- No information provided.
[No] No information is given about duplicate study selection and data extraction.

A3. Was a comprehensive literature search performed?
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎The publications were identified by searching the major medical databases such as MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library for relevant papers published between January 1992 and July 2012.&quot;</span>
[Yes] The study performed a comprehensive literature search using multiple databases.

A4. Was the status of publication (i.e. grey literature) used as an inclusion criterion?
- No information provided.
[NA] The study does not mention the use of grey literature as an inclusion criterion.

A5. Was a list of studies (included and excluded) provided?
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎According to the search strategy and inclusion criteria, a total of 17 studies [5], [15], [16], [17], [18], [19], [20], [21], [22], [23], [24], [25], [26], [27], [28], [29], [30] that included 1809 appendicectomy cases (793 SILA and 1016 TILA) were considered suitable for meta-analysis.&quot;</span>
[Yes] The study provides a list of included studies.

A6. Were the characteristics of the included studies provided?
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎The characteristics of the 17 studies (1 randomized controlled trial [22] and 16 retrospective studies [5], [15], [16], [17], [18], [19], [20], [21], [23], [24], [25], [26], [27], [28], [29], [30]) are shown in Table 1.&quot;</span>
[Yes] The study provides the characteristics of the included studies.

A7. Was the scientific quality of the included studies assessed and documented?
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎We used a star scoring system [12] based on criteria related to study design, comparability of patient groups, and outcome assessment to assess literature quality. The total score was 9 stars, and the quality of each study was graded as level 1 (0–5 stars) or level 2 (6–9 stars).&quot;</span>
[Yes] The study assessed the scientific quality of the included studies using a star scoring system.

A8. Was the scientific quality of the included studies used appropriately in formulating conclusions?

The drawback is that SILA is associated with higher conversion rate, and perhaps higher surgical difficulty and hospitalization costs.&quot;</span>
[Yes] The study considers the scientific quality of the included studies in formulating conclusions.

A9. Were the methods used to combine the findings of studies appropriate?
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎The random-effect model was used to combine the data due to evident heterogeneity.&quot;</span>
[Yes] The study used appropriate methods to combine the findings of studies.

A10. Was the likelihood of publication bias assessed?
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎The funnel plot of standard of error by effect size for the measurements of wound infection, showed an equal distribution of studies around the middle line, indicating that publication bias was not evident.&quot;</span>
[Yes] The study assessed the likelihood of publication bias using a funnel plot.

A11. Was the conflict of interest included?
- No information provided.
[NA] The study does not mention the conflict of interest.

Overall, the methodological quality of the systematic review is moderate. The study provides a clear research question, inclusion criteria, and search strategy. However, there is no information on duplicate study selection and data extraction, and the conflict of interest is not mentioned.</pre>

A7. Was the scientific quality of the included studies assessed and documented? 'A priori' methods of assessment should be provided (e.g., for effectiveness studies if the author(s) chose to include only randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled studies, or allocation concealment as inclusion criteria); for other types of studies alternative items will be relevant. Note: Can include use of a quality scoring tool or checklist, e.g., Jadad scale, risk of bias, sensitivity analysis, etc., or a description of quality items, with some kind of result for EACH study (“low” or “high” is fine, as long as it is clear which studies scored “low” and which scored “high”; a summary score/range for all studies is not acceptable).

Quotes:
- No quotes provided.

Reasoning: No information is provided about the scientific quality of the included studies being assessed and documented.

Response: [No]

A8. Was the scientific quality of the included studies used appropriately in formulating conclusions? The results of the methodological rigor and scientific quality should be considered in the analysis and the conclusions of the review, and explicitly stated in formulating recommendations. Note: Might say something such as “the results should be interpreted with caution due to poor quality of included studies.” Cannot score “yes” for this question if scored “no” for question A7.

Quotes:
- No quotes provided.

Reasoning: No information is provided about the scientific quality of the included studies being used in formulating conclusions.

Response: [No]

A9. Were the methods used to combine the findings of studies appropriate? For the pooled results, a test should be done to ensure the studies were combinable, to assess their homogeneity (i.e., Chi-squared test for homogeneity, I2 ). If heterogeneity exists a random effects model should be used and/or the clinical appropriateness of combining should be taken into consideration (i.e., is it sensible to combine?). Note: Indicate “yes” if they mention or describe heterogeneity, i.e., if they explain that they cannot pool because of heterogeneity/variability between interventions.

Quotes:
- No quotes provided.

Reasoning: No information is provided about the methods used to combine the findings of studies.

Response: [NA]

A10. Was the likelihood of publication bias assessed? An assessment of publication bias should include a combination of graphical aids (e.g., funnel plot, other available tests) and/or statistical tests (e.g., Egger regression test, Hedges-Olken). Note: If no test values or funnel plot included, score “no”. Score “yes” if mentions that publication bias could not be assessed because there were fewer than 10 included studies.

Quotes:
- No quotes provided.

Reasoning: No information is provided about the likelihood of publication bias being assessed.

Response: [NA]

A11. Was the conflict of interest included? Potential sources of support should be clearly acknowledged in both the systematic review and the included studies. Note: To get a “yes,” must indicate source of funding or support for the systematic review AND for each of the included studies.

Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎Conflict of Interest: None&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The conflict of interest is clearly stated as none.

Response: [Yes]</pre>

Summary: The systematic review and meta-analysis in this study have some methodological limitations. While it had an a priori design, duplicate study selection, and data extraction, it did not assess the scientific quality of the included studies, use the scientific quality in formulating conclusions, assess publication bias, or report conflicts of interest. Additionally, it did not provide a list of excluded studies.</pre>

- <span style='background-color: #ffe9e2' title='Added squared brackets during extraction'>[Yes]</span>, the authors clearly state the objective and design of the study.

A2. Was there duplicate study selection and data extraction?
- No information is provided in the text regarding duplicate study selection and data extraction.
- <span style='background-color: #ffe9e2' title='Added squared brackets during extraction'>[No]</span>, there is no evidence of duplicate study selection and data extraction.

A3. Was a comprehensive literature search performed?
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎A literature search (PubMed and Embase) was performed, and all human studies published in the English-language literature between 2006 and 2011 describing esophageal replacement for LGEA were identified, using the medical subject headings “Esophageal Atresia,” “Long-gap,” “Esophagoplasty,” “Replacement,” “Interposition,” “Substitution,” “Graft,” and their combinations.&quot;</span>
- <span style='background-color: #ffe9e2' title='Added squared brackets during extraction'>[Yes]</span>, a comprehensive literature search was performed using multiple databases and appropriate search terms.

- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎The initial search yielded 187 potentially relevant articles, of which 172 articles were excluded because of the failure to meet the inclusion criteria. A total of 15 studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria and were analyzed in this review.&quot;</span>
- <span style='background-color: #ffe9e2' title='Added squared brackets during extraction'>[Yes]</span>, a list of included studies is provided.

A6. Were the characteristics of the included studies provided?
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎A total of 15 studies (4 comparative retrospective, 8 retrospective, and 3 prospective) including 470 patients (264 LGEA) were identified; 344 (73%) patients underwent CI, 99 (21%) GPU, and 27 (6%) JI.&quot;</span>
- <span style='background-color: #ffe9e2' title='Added squared brackets during extraction'>[Yes]</span>, the characteristics of the included studies are provided.

Well-designed prospective comparative studies are lacking, major and minor postoperative complications are sometimes not properly defined, follow-up data are often deficient and when presented they are not homogenously described in the different studies.&quot;</span>
- <span style='background-color: #ffe9e2' title='Added squared brackets during extraction'>[No]</span>, the scientific quality of the included studies was not assessed or documented.

- <span style='background-color: #ffe9e2' title='Added squared brackets during extraction'>[Yes]</span>, the scientific quality of the included studies was used appropriately in formulating conclusions.

A9. Were the methods used to combine the findings of studies appropriate?
- <span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 99.6%):

- <span style='background-color: #ffe9e2' title='Added squared brackets during extraction'>[Yes]</span>, the conflict of interest was included.

Overall, the methodological quality of this systematic review is moderate. The review clearly states its objective and design, performs a comprehensive literature search, provides a list of included studies, and describes the characteristics of the included studies. However, the review does not assess the scientific quality of the included studies, does not appropriately combine the findings of studies, and does not assess the likelihood of publication bias.</pre>

Overall, the systematic review adequately addressed 6 out of the 11 AMSTAR criteria. The review had an 'a priori' design, performed duplicate study selection and data extraction, conducted a comprehensive literature search, provided the characteristics of the included studies, assessed the scientific quality of the included studies, and assessed the likelihood of publication bias. However, the review did not provide a list of included and excluded studies, did not use the scientific quality of the included studies in formulating conclusions, and did not include conflict of interest statements. Additionally, the review did not mention the use of publication status as an inclusion criterion.</pre>

Summary: The systematic review adequately addressed most of the AMSTAR criteria, including having an 'a priori' design, conducting a comprehensive literature search, providing a list of included and excluded studies, assessing the scientific quality of the included studies, using the scientific quality appropriately in formulating conclusions, and disclosing conflicts of interest. However, there is insufficient information to determine if there was duplicate study selection and data extraction, if the status of publication was used as an inclusion criterion, if the methods used to combine the findings of studies were appropriate, and if the likelihood of publication bias was assessed.</pre>

A1. Was an 'a priori' design provided?
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎We have performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies that compares survival, CDH recurrence risk, operative time and prosthetic patch usage between CDH neonates whose repair was approached by MIS and those where it was undertaken by open surgery.&quot;</span> 
- The study clearly states that a systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted, indicating an a priori design. 

[Yes]

A2. Was there duplicate study selection and data extraction?
- No information is provided about duplicate study selection and data extraction.

[No]

A3. Was a comprehensive literature search performed?
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎MEDLINE (1950 to present), Embase (1980 to present) and Cochrane Controlled Trials Register databases were searched using the keywords ‘diaphragmatic hernia AND thoracoscopic,’ ‘diaphragmatic hernia AND laparoscopic,’ and ‘diaphragmatic hernia AND minimally-invasive.’ Relevant conference proceedings were also searched for abstracts of appropriate studies. Finally, citations of relevant full text reports were hand-searched for any additional studies.&quot;</span>
- The study clearly describes the databases and search terms used, as well as the search of conference proceedings and hand-searching of references.

[Yes]

A4. Was the status of publication (i.e. grey literature) used as an inclusion criterion?
- No information is provided about the status of publication being used as an inclusion criterion.

[No]

A5. Was a list of studies (included and excluded) provided?
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎The electronic search identified a total of 292 studies. Exclusions were made as detailed in the flow chart (Fig. 2). Search of conference proceedings yielded a further, unpublished study, resulting in 3 studies being incorporated in the meta-analysis.&quot;</span>
- The study mentions that a flow chart was used to detail the process of study selection, but it does not provide a list of included and excluded studies.

[No]

A6. Were the characteristics of the included studies provided?
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎The 3 included studies compare series of neonatal thoracoscopic and open CDH repairs performed at the same institutions.&quot;</span>
- The study mentions that the included studies compare neonatal thoracoscopic and open CDH repairs, but it does not provide specific characteristics of the included studies.

[No]

A7. Was the scientific quality of the included studies assessed and documented?
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎All are limited by their methodology, primarily due to the control (open surgery) groups being historical; there is therefore significant risk of case selection and performance bias.&quot;</span>
- The study acknowledges the limitations of the included studies, but it does not provide a specific assessment or documentation of the scientific quality of the included studies.

[No]

A8. Was the scientific quality of the included studies used appropriately in formulating conclusions?
- No information is provided about the scientific quality of the included studies being used in formulating conclusions.

[No]

A9. Were the methods used to combine the findings of studies appropriate?
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎Meta-analysis reveals that recurrence was higher (RR: 3.21 [1.11, 9.29], P = 0.03) and operative time was longer (WMD: 50.38 minutes [31.79, 68.97], P < 0.00001) in the endosurgical group.&quot;</span>
- The study used appropriate methods to combine the findings of the included studies by conducting a meta-analysis.

[Yes]

A10. Was the likelihood of publication bias assessed?
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎Given the small number of eligible studies we have not performed a funnel plot to screen for publication bias.&quot;</span>
- The study did not assess the likelihood of publication bias.

[No]

A11. Was the conflict of interest included?
- No information is provided about the conflict of interest being included.

title="A10. Was the likelihood of publication bias assessed? An assessment of publication bias should include a combination of graphical aids (e.g., funnel plot, other available tests) and/or statistical tests (e.g., Egger regression test, Hedges-Olken). Note: If no test values or funnel plot included, score “no”. Score “yes” if mentions that publication bias could not be assessed because there were fewer than 10 included studies.">

A2. Was there duplicate study selection and data extraction?
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎Three reviewers (SKN, KLN and CY) independently assessed selected studies, extracted and tabulated data from each article: first author, year of publication, study design, follow up period, mean age and number of subjects operated on with each technique, and end point data (operative times, length of postoperative hospital stay, re-operation rates and postoperative complications including bile leak, adhesive intestinal obstruction, cholangitis, reflux/gastritis and anastomotic stricture). The reviewers reached consensus at each stage of the screening process.&quot;</span>
- The study clearly states that three reviewers independently assessed studies and extracted data, and consensus was reached at each stage of the process.
- [Yes]

A5. Was a list of studies (included and excluded) provided?
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎The initial search yielded 14 articles meeting the inclusion criteria. Out of 14 studies, two studies were excluded because they overlapped with their own later studies [[7], [8]]. Five studies were excluded as they included comparisons of interposition hepaticoduodenostomy or one of its modifications [[2], [9], [10], [11], [12]]. One study was excluded as the comparison was unclear [13], leaving 6 studies for meta-analysis [[14], [15], [16], [17], [18], [19]].&quot;</span>
- The study provides a list of included and excluded studies.
- [Yes]

A6. Were the characteristics of the included studies provided?

<pre>
A1. Was an 'a priori' design provided? The research question and inclusion criteria should be established before the conduct of the review. Note: Need to refer to a protocol, ethics approval, or pre-determined/a priori published research objectives to score a “yes.”

- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎A systematic review and cumulative meta-analysis was performed, including all articles describing the Foker technique or delayed primary anastomosis.&quot;</span> 

[Yes] The review clearly states that a systematic review and meta-analysis were performed, indicating that an a priori design was provided.

A2. Was there duplicate study selection and data extraction? There should be at least two independent data extractors and a consensus procedure for disagreements should be in place. Note: 2 people do study selection, 2 people do data extraction, consensus process or one person checks the other’s work.

- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎Authors extracted data from the retrieved articles. We contacted the primary authors of any articles for which there was inadequate information, or if relevant data could not be extracted.&quot;</span>

[No] The text does not mention duplicate study selection or data extraction, nor does it mention a consensus procedure for disagreements.

A3. Was a comprehensive literature search performed? At least two electronic sources should be searched. The report must include years and databases used (e.g., Central, EMBASE, and MEDLINE). Key words and/or MESH terms must be stated and where feasible the search strategy should be provided. All searches should be supplemented by consulting current contents, reviews, textbooks, specialized registers, or experts in the particular field of study, and by reviewing the references in the studies found. Note: If at least 2 sources + one supplementary strategy used, select “yes” (Cochrane register/Central counts as 2 sources; a grey literature search counts as supplementary).

- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎All publications describing both surgical procedures were sought from the Cochrane Trials Register and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials database. All studies were identified through electronic searches of MEDLINE (1966 onward), Embase (1980 onward), and CINAHL (1982 onward), and from hand searching journals and conference proceedings.&quot;</span>

[Yes] The text clearly states that a comprehensive literature search was performed, including searching multiple electronic sources (Cochrane Trials Register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, Embase, and CINAHL) as well as hand searching journals and conference proceedings.

A4. Was the status of publication (i.e. grey literature) used as an inclusion criterion? The authors should state that they searched for reports regardless of their publication type. The authors should state whether or not they excluded any reports (from the systematic review), based on their publication status, language etc. Note: If review indicates that there was a search for “grey literature” or “unpublished literature,” indicate “yes.” SIGLE database, dissertations, conference proceedings, and trial registries are all considered grey for this purpose. If searching a source that contains both grey and non-grey, must specify that they were searching for grey/unpublished lit.

- The text does not mention the status of publication as an inclusion criterion or whether any reports were excluded based on publication status.

[NA] The text does not provide enough information to determine if the status of publication was used as an inclusion criterion.

A5. Was a list of studies (included and excluded) provided? A list of included and excluded studies should be provided. Note: Acceptable if the excluded studies are referenced. If there is an electronic link to the list but the link is dead, select “no.”

- The text does not mention whether a list of included and excluded studies was provided.

[NA] The text does not provide enough information to determine if a list of included and excluded studies was provided.

A6. Were the characteristics of the included studies provided? In an aggregated form such as a table, data from the original studies should be provided on the participants, interventions and outcomes. The ranges of characteristics in all the studies analyzed e.g., age, race, sex, relevant socioeconomic data, disease status, duration, severity, or other diseases should be reported.

- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎The overall numbers of study subjects managed in these publications were 71 infants, ranging from 1 to 60 newborns with long-gap EA per study. All infants had long-gap EA without TEF. Data about the initial gap length were reported in all studies with a mean of 5.4 cm (range 3–12.5 cm). No study reported data about the preoperative gap length. The time until an anastomosis could be achieved was reported in all studies with a mean of 14 ± 8.2 days. The follow-up time was 5 years (range 0.2–10 years).&quot;</span>

[Yes] The text provides the characteristics of the included studies, including the number of study subjects, the initial gap length, the time until anastomosis, and the follow-up time.

A7. Was the scientific quality of the included studies assessed and documented? 'A priori' methods of assessment should be provided (e.g., for effectiveness studies if the author(s) chose to include only randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled studies, or allocation concealment as inclusion criteria); for other types of studies alternative items will be relevant. Note: Can include use of a quality scoring tool or checklist, e.g., Jadad scale, risk of bias, sensitivity analysis, etc., or a description of quality items, with some kind of result for EACH study (“low” or “high” is fine, as long as it is clear which studies scored “low” and which scored “high”; a summary score/range for all studies is not acceptable).

- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎Our methodological assessment revealed that the studies ranged from poor to moderate quality.&quot;</span>

[Yes] The text states that a methodological assessment was performed and that the studies ranged from poor to moderate quality.

A8. Was the scientific quality of the included studies used appropriately in formulating conclusions? The results of the methodological rigor and scientific quality should be considered in the analysis and the conclusions of the review, and explicitly stated in formulating recommendations. Note: Might say something such as “the results should be interpreted with caution due to poor quality of included studies.” Cannot score “yes” for this question if scored “no” for question A7.

- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎The results of this review fail to provide overwhelming support to either approach, and based on our analysis both approaches must be deemed to be acceptable.&quot;</span>

[Yes] The text states that the results of the methodological rigor and scientific quality were considered in formulating the conclusion that both approaches are acceptable.

A9. Were the methods used to combine the findings of studies appropriate? For the pooled results, a test should be done to ensure the studies were combinable, to assess their homogeneity (i.e., Chi-squared test for homogeneity, I2 ). If heterogeneity exists a random effects model should be used and/or the clinical appropriateness of combining should be taken into consideration (i.e., is it sensible to combine?). Note: Indicate “yes” if they mention or describe heterogeneity, i.e., if they explain that they cannot pool because of heterogeneity/variability between interventions.

- The text does not mention any methods used to combine the findings of studies.

[NA] The text does not provide enough information to determine if the methods used to combine the findings of studies were appropriate.

A10. Was the likelihood of publication bias assessed? An assessment of publication bias should include a combination of graphical aids (e.g., funnel plot, other available tests) and/or statistical tests (e.g., Egger regression test, Hedges-Olken). Note: If no test values or funnel plot included, score “no”. Score “yes” if mentions that publication bias could not be assessed because there were fewer than 10 included studies.

- The text does not mention any assessment of publication bias.

[NA] The text does not provide enough information to determine if the likelihood of publication bias was assessed.

A11. Was the conflict of interest included? Potential sources of support should be clearly acknowledged in both the systematic review and the included studies. Note: To get a “yes,” must indicate source of funding or support for the systematic review AND for each of the included studies.

- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎Conflict of Interest: None&quot;</span>

[Yes] The text clearly states that there is no conflict of interest.

Overall, the methodological quality of the systematic review is moderate. The review provided an a priori design, conducted a comprehensive literature search, provided the characteristics of the included studies, assessed the scientific quality of the included studies, used the scientific quality appropriately in formulating conclusions, and stated the absence of conflict of interest. However, the review did not mention duplicate study selection and data extraction, the status of publication as an inclusion criterion, a list of included and excluded studies, the methods used to combine the findings of studies, the assessment of publication bias, or any conflicts of interest in the included studies.</pre>

A1. Was an 'a priori' design provided?
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎The aim of our study was to compare recurrence, small bowel obstruction (SBO), and mortality rates for CDH repair between an absorbable (Surgisis [SIS]; Cook Biotech, Inc, West Lafayette, IN) and a nonabsorbable polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) (Gore-Tex; W.L. Gore & Associates, Inc, Neward, DE) material at our institution.&quot;</span> 
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎Because the condition is rare and single institution numbers are small, we also combined our data with the published literature to perform a meta-analysis comparing both materials in terms of CDH recurrence and SBO.&quot;</span>
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎To be selected, a study had to evaluate an absorbable (SIS) and a nonabsorbable (PTFE) material for CDH patch repair and provide relevant and interpretable data.&quot;</span>
- [Yes] The study clearly states the research question and the comparison of interest.

A2. Was there duplicate study selection and data extraction?
- No information provided.
- [No] There is no mention of duplicate study selection or data extraction.

A3. Was a comprehensive literature search performed?
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎All publications describing both absorbable (SIS) and nonabsorbable (PTFE) material for treatment of CDH were sought from the Cochrane Trials Register and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) database. All studies were identified through electronic searches of MEDLINE (1966 onwards), EMBASE (1980 onwards), and CINAHL (1982 onwards) and from hand-searching journals and conference proceedings.&quot;</span>
- [Yes] The study performed a comprehensive literature search using multiple databases and additional sources.

A4. Was the status of publication (i.e. grey literature) used as an inclusion criterion?
- No information provided.
- [NA] The study does not mention the use of grey literature as an inclusion criterion.

A5. Was a list of studies (included and excluded) provided?
- No information provided.
- [No] There is no mention of a list of included and excluded studies.

A6. Were the characteristics of the included studies provided?
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎Two publications were retrieved (San Francisco and Kansas City) [8], [9], comparing the 2 materials with respect to SBO.&quot;</span>
- [Yes] The study mentions the characteristics of the included studies.

A7. Was the scientific quality of the included studies assessed and documented?
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎Three authors (RR, AN, and JL) independently assessed all published articles and identified as potentially relevant by the literature search for inclusion in the review.&quot;</span>
- [Yes] The study assessed the scientific quality of the included studies.

A8. Was the scientific quality of the included studies used appropriately in formulating conclusions?
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎Our data further support the concept that there is no ideal prosthetic material for patch repair of CDH. Surgisis and PTFE had similarly high complication rates in terms of recurrence, SBO, and mortality. The meta-analysis performed further supported the lack of difference in these outcomes between absorbable and nonabsorbable materials.&quot;</span>
- [Yes] The study used the scientific quality of the included studies to formulate conclusions.

A9. Were the methods used to combine the findings of studies appropriate?
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎Meta-analysis was performed combining our data with the data from this study (Fig. 1), which resulted in a total of 40 patients repaired with SIS and 54 patients repaired with PTFE.&quot;</span>
- [Yes] The study used appropriate methods to combine the findings of studies.

A10. Was the likelihood of publication bias assessed?
- No information provided.
- [NA] The study does not mention the assessment of publication bias.

A11. Was the conflict of interest included?
- No information provided.
- [NA] The study does not mention the conflict of interest.</pre>

Overall assessment: 
- The systematic review lacks important methodological components, such as duplicate study selection and data extraction, assessment of scientific quality of included studies, and assessment of publication bias. 
- The review does provide a comprehensive literature search and includes the characteristics of the included studies. 
- However, without information on the scientific quality of the included studies, it is difficult to determine the reliability of the review's conclusions.</pre>

- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎The best first-line treatment of pediatric achalasia was determined to be HM in two articles, PD in one article, and equal efficacy in one article.&quot;</span>
- [Yes] The scientific quality of the included studies was used in formulating conclusions.

A9. Were the methods used to combine the findings of studies appropriate?
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎The heterogeneity of the study designs and treatment methods results in an inherent bias resulting in the inability to perform an accurate meta-analysis.&quot;</span>
- [NA] The methods used to combine the findings of studies were not applicable as a meta-analysis was not performed.

A10. Was the likelihood of publication bias assessed?
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎This systematic review focused on idiopathic achalasia which is an important distinction from syndromic achalasia.&quot;</span>

- [Yes] The conflict of interest was included.

Overall, the systematic review adequately addressed most of the AMSTAR criteria, including having an a priori design, duplicate study selection and data extraction, comprehensive literature search, providing a list of included and excluded studies, providing the characteristics of the included studies, assessing the scientific quality of the included studies, using the scientific quality in formulating conclusions, and including conflict of interest. However, the review did not assess the likelihood of publication bias and did not perform a meta-analysis to combine the findings of the studies.</pre>

- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎Patient characteristics of the included studies are summarized in Tables 1 and 2.&quot;</span> This indicates that the characteristics of the included studies were provided. [Yes]

A7. Was the scientific quality of the included studies assessed and documented?
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎We appraised the quality of reporting of the included studies in duplicate (AS and ML), with discrepancies resolved by discussion and consensus. We used the Methodological Index for Nonrandomized Studies (MINORS).&quot;</span> This indicates that the scientific quality of the included studies was assessed using a quality scoring tool. [Yes]

A8. Was the scientific quality of the included studies used appropriately in formulating conclusions?
- No information is provided about whether the results of the methodological rigor and scientific quality were considered in the analysis and conclusions of the review. [No]

A9. Were the methods used to combine the findings of studies appropriate?
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎Case series and observational studies are inherently heterogeneous, thus we decided a priori to use a random-effects model to account for between-study heterogeneity.&quot;</span> This indicates that the methods used to combine the findings of studies were appropriate. [Yes]

A10. Was the likelihood of publication bias assessed?
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎Due to the small number of studies included in this review (<10), funnel plots to evaluate publication bias were not constructed as they would be non-informative.&quot;</span> This indicates that the likelihood of publication bias was not assessed. [No]

A11. Was the conflict of interest included?
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎No studies reported on conflict of interest.&quot;</span> This indicates that the conflict of interest was not included. [No]

In summary, the methodological quality of this systematic review is moderate. The review had an a priori design, duplicate study selection and data extraction, and a comprehensive literature search. However, the review did not assess the scientific quality of the included studies in formulating conclusions, did not assess the likelihood of publication bias, and did not report on conflict of interest.</pre>

A2. Was there duplicate study selection and data extraction?
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎Studies included (1) peer-review publications with 3 or more patients, and (2) clinical outcomes defined by authors.&quot;</span>
- There is no mention of duplicate study selection or data extraction.

[No]

A3. Was a comprehensive literature search performed?
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎Electronic searches of MEDLINE (PubMed), EMBase, Google Scholar, and Cochrane Libraries were conducted for English language articles only without calendar or year limits.&quot;</span>

- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎We followed the guidelines according to the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses: the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) statement.&quot;</span>
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎There was no language restriction.&quot;</span>
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎We aimed to include both randomised and non-randomised studies as relevant to this review.&quot;</span>
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎An anastomotic stricture was defined as a clinically and radiologically proven stricture at the level of anastomosis following surgically corrected oesophageal atresia.&quot;</span>
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎Balloon dilatation was defined as the use of a catheter with an inflatable balloon capable of radially dilating a stricture.&quot;</span>
- <span style='background-color: #ffe9e2' title='Added squared brackets during extraction'>[Yes]</span>, an 'a priori' design was provided as the authors clearly stated their research question, inclusion criteria, and followed the PRISMA guidelines.

A2. Was there duplicate study selection and data extraction?
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎Two reviewers (M.T. and A.T.) independently abstracted data from all studies onto a predefined data collection form.&quot;</span>
- <span style='background-color: #ffe9e2' title='Added squared brackets during extraction'>[Yes]</span>, there was duplicate study selection and data extraction.

A3. Was a comprehensive literature search performed?
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎We searched the standard databases (January, 1960–May, 2012): MEDLINE, EMBASE and Cochrane Library Controlled Trials Register (CENTRAL) using the MeSH Terms “esophageal stricture”, “esophageal stenosis” and “balloon dilatation” to identify the studies.&quot;</span>
- <span style='background-color: #ffe9e2' title='Added squared brackets during extraction'>[Yes]</span>, a comprehensive literature search was performed using multiple databases and appropriate search terms.

- Not mentioned.
- <span style='background-color: #ffe9e2' title='Added squared brackets during extraction'>[NA]</span>

A5. Was a list of studies (included and excluded) provided?
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎We identified 26 studies from our search that were deemed relevant and these were further scrutinised for eligibility for inclusion in this review. Only five studies met the inclusion criteria; 21 studies were excluded for reasons outlined in the selection flow chart in Fig. 1.&quot;</span>
- <span style='background-color: #ffe9e2' title='Added squared brackets during extraction'>[Yes]</span>, a list of included and excluded studies was provided.

- <span style='background-color: #ffe9e2' title='Added squared brackets during extraction'>[Yes]</span>, the characteristics of the included studies were provided in Table 1.

A7. Was the scientific quality of the included studies assessed and documented?
- Not mentioned.
- <span style='background-color: #ffe9e2' title='Added squared brackets during extraction'>[No]</span>

A8. Was the scientific quality of the included studies used appropriately in formulating conclusions?
- Not mentioned.
- <span style='background-color: #ffe9e2' title='Added squared brackets during extraction'>[NA]</span>

A9. Were the methods used to combine the findings of studies appropriate?
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎We aimed to include both randomised and non-randomised studies as relevant to this review.&quot;</span>
- <span style='background-color: #ffe9e2' title='Added squared brackets during extraction'>[Yes]</span>, the methods used to combine the findings of studies were appropriate as the authors included both randomized and non-randomized studies.

A10. Was the likelihood of publication bias assessed?
- Not mentioned.
- <span style='background-color: #ffe9e2' title='Added squared brackets during extraction'>[NA]</span>

A11. Was the conflict of interest included?
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎Conflict of interest: None&quot;</span>
- <span style='background-color: #ffe9e2' title='Added squared brackets during extraction'>[Yes]</span>, the conflict of interest was included.

Overall, this systematic review has some strengths such as an 'a priori' design, duplicate study selection and data extraction, comprehensive literature search, and providing a list of included and excluded studies. However, it lacks the assessment of the scientific quality of the included studies and the assessment of publication bias.</pre>

The methodological quality of this systematic review is low as it did not meet most of the AMSTAR criteria. The review did not provide information on duplicate study selection and data extraction, the characteristics of the included studies, the scientific quality of the included studies, the appropriate use of scientific quality in formulating conclusions, the methods used to combine the findings of studies, the assessment of publication bias, and the inclusion of conflict of interest.</pre>

A9. No information provided. [NA]

A10. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎Possible publication bias was analyzed by generating funnel plots of the studies used for all of the evaluated comparisons of outcomes. Only one study [17] lied outside the 95 % CI and the funnel plots of fistula, meatal stenosis and wound dehiscence showed no obvious asymmetry, suggesting little evidence of publication bias.&quot;</span> [Yes]
- The study assesses the likelihood of publication bias by analyzing funnel plots.

A11. No information provided. [NA]

Overall, the methodological quality of the systematic review is adequate based on the AMSTAR criteria. The review provides details of the search strategy, includes a list of included studies, extracts data from each study, and considers the scientific quality of the included studies in formulating conclusions. However, it does not provide information on the assessment of publication bias or conflict of interest.</pre>

- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎We used MINORS [20] to assess the quality of all relevant non-randomized studies (comparative or non-comparative).&quot;</span>
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎Two reviewers independently assessed each included study and compared the scores for each item on the applicable quality assessment tool to reach a consensus.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The authors clearly describe the methods used to conduct the systematic review, including the search strategy, study selection process, and quality assessment tools used. They also mention using a Delphi-like method to determine the research question and issues of concern to pediatric surgeons. Therefore, an 'a priori' design was provided.
Answer: [Yes]

A2. Was there duplicate study selection and data extraction?
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎Article screening took place in two stages—title and abstract, and full-text screening—both of which were conducted independently by two reviewers, followed by a consensus process.&quot;</span>
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎Two reviewers independently assessed each included study and compared the scores for each item on the applicable quality assessment tool to reach a consensus.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The study selection and data extraction processes were conducted independently by two reviewers, followed by a consensus process. Therefore, there was duplicate study selection and data extraction.
Answer: [Yes]

A3. Was a comprehensive literature search performed?
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎We conducted electronic searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CINAHL from inception to September 2014.&quot;</span>
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎We used the following search terms: “Cryptorchidism” AND “Intra-abdominal” OR “Abdomen/abdominal cavity/inguinal canal/groin.”&quot;</span>
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎We also hand-searched the reference sections of included articles for additional relevant studies.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The authors conducted a comprehensive literature search by searching multiple databases and hand-searching reference lists. They also provide details of the search terms used. Therefore, a comprehensive literature search was performed.
Answer: [Yes]

A4. Was the status of publication (i.e. grey literature) used as an inclusion criterion?
- No relevant quotes.

Reasoning: The text does not mention whether the status of publication was used as an inclusion criterion. Therefore, it is not clear if the authors searched for grey literature or unpublished literature.
Answer: [NA]

A5. Was a list of studies (included and excluded) provided?
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎We performed full-text screening for these articles, excluding 17 that did not meet our criteria [7, 10, 22–36]. The remaining 31 studies comprised two SRs and 29 non-randomized studies; we quality assessed and summarized these studies (Table 1).&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The authors mention that they performed full-text screening and excluded 17 studies that did not meet their criteria. They also provide a summary table of the included studies. However, they do not explicitly state whether a list of excluded studies was provided. Therefore, it is unclear if a list of excluded studies was provided.
Answer: [No]

A6. Were the characteristics of the included studies provided?
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎We quality assessed and summarized these studies (Table 1).&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The authors mention that they quality assessed and summarized the included studies, but they do not provide specific details about the characteristics of the included studies. Therefore, it is unclear if the characteristics of the included studies were provided.
Answer: [No]

A7. Was the scientific quality of the included studies assessed and documented?
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎We used AMSTAR [18] to assess the quality of all relevant systematic reviews (SRs).&quot;</span>
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎Had we identified any randomized controlled trials (RCTs), we would have used the Cochrane ‘Risk of bias’ tool [19] to assess their quality.&quot;</span>
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎We used MINORS [20] to assess the quality of all relevant non-randomized studies (comparative or non-comparative).&quot;</span>
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎Two reviewers independently assessed each included study and compared the scores for each item on the applicable quality assessment tool to reach a consensus.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The authors clearly state that they used quality assessment tools (AMSTAR, Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool, and MINORS) to assess the scientific quality of the included studies. They also mention that two reviewers independently assessed each included study and reached a consensus. Therefore, the scientific quality of the included studies was assessed and documented.
Answer: [Yes]

A8. Was the scientific quality of the included studies used appropriately in formulating conclusions?
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎The results of our systematic review should, therefore, be interpreted with caution.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The authors mention that the results of the systematic review should be interpreted with caution due to the overall lack of good-quality evidence. However, they do not explicitly state whether the scientific quality of the included studies was used in formulating conclusions. Therefore, it is unclear if the scientific quality of the included studies was used appropriately in formulating conclusions.
Answer: [No]

A9. Were the methods used to combine the findings of studies appropriate?
- No relevant quotes.

Reasoning: The text does not mention any methods used to combine the findings of studies. Since the authors state that meta-analysis was not possible due to heterogeneity of the data, it is unclear if any other methods were used to combine the findings. Therefore, it is not clear if the methods used to combine the findings of studies were appropriate.
Answer: [NA]

A10. Was the likelihood of publication bias assessed?
- No relevant quotes.

Reasoning: The text does not mention any assessment of publication bias. Since the authors state that there were no RCTs and only two SRs of relatively low quality, it is unclear if publication bias was assessed. Therefore, it is not clear if the likelihood of publication bias was assessed.
Answer: [NA]

A11. Was the conflict of interest included?
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎The authors declare that they have no conflict of interest.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The authors explicitly state that they have no conflict of interest. Therefore, the conflict of interest was included.

A1. Was an 'a priori' design provided?
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎For this meta-analysis, the Medline (1990–2009), Embase (1990–2009) and Cochrane databases were searched using the keyword ‘hypospadias’. Inclusion criteria were: i) primary repairs; ii) distal hypospadias; iii) paediatric case series; iv) standard Mathieu and TIP techniques; v) complication data obtainable from the paper.&quot;</span> 
- The study clearly states the inclusion criteria that were established before conducting the review. [Yes]

A2. Was there duplicate study selection and data extraction?
- No information is provided about duplicate study selection and data extraction. 
- It is unclear whether there were two independent data extractors and a consensus procedure for disagreements. [No]

A3. Was a comprehensive literature search performed?
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎The Medline (1990–Dec 2009), Embase (1990–Dec 2009) and Cochrane databases were searched using the single search term ‘hypospadias’ to ensure the broadest capture of relevant papers.&quot;</span>
- The study used multiple electronic sources (Medline, Embase, Cochrane) to perform the literature search. [Yes]

A4. Was the status of publication (i.e. grey literature) used as an inclusion criterion?
- No information is provided about the status of publication being used as an inclusion criterion.
- It is unclear whether the authors searched for grey literature or unpublished literature. [No]

A6. Were the characteristics of the included studies provided?
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎We identified an increased incidence of urethral fistulae with the Mathieu technique (3.8% vs 5.3%, P = 0.028); however, this is lost on subgroup analysis. An increased incidence of meatal stenosis was identified in the TIP group (3.1% vs 0.7%, P < 0.001).&quot;</span>
- The study provides the characteristics of the included studies in terms of the incidence of urethral fistulae and meatal stenosis for the Mathieu and TIP techniques. [Yes]

A7. Was the scientific quality of the included studies assessed and documented?
- No information is provided about the scientific quality of the included studies being assessed and documented.

You are an expert in systematic reviews and are tasked to assess the methodological quality of a systematic review with the AMSTAR tool based on the full text of its publication. AMSTAR consists of the following items:

---
# AMSTAR
A1. Was an 'a priori' design provided? The research question and inclusion criteria should be established before the conduct of the review. Note: Need to refer to a protocol, ethics approval, or pre-determined/a priori published research objectives to score a “yes.”
A2. Was there duplicate study selection and data extraction? There should be at least two independent data extractors and a consensus procedure for disagreements should be in place. Note: 2 people do study selection, 2 people do data extraction, consensus process or one person checks the other’s work.
A3. Was a comprehensive literature search performed? At least two electronic sources should be searched. The report must include years and databases used (e.g., Central, EMBASE, and MEDLINE). Key words and/or MESH terms must be stated and where feasible the search strategy should be provided. All searches should be supplemented by consulting current contents, reviews, textbooks, specialized registers, or experts in the particular field of study, and by reviewing the references in the studies found. Note: If at least 2 sources + one supplementary strategy used, select “yes” (Cochrane register/Central counts as 2 sources; a grey literature search counts as supplementary).
A4. Was the status of publication (i.e. grey literature) used as an inclusion criterion? The authors should state that they searched for reports regardless of their publication type. The authors should state whether or not they excluded any reports (from the systematic review), based on their publication status, language etc. Note: If review indicates that there was a search for “grey literature” or “unpublished literature,” indicate “yes.” SIGLE database, dissertations, conference proceedings, and trial registries are all considered grey for this purpose. If searching a source that contains both grey and non-grey, must specify that they were searching for grey/unpublished lit.
A5. Was a list of studies (included and excluded) provided? A list of included and excluded studies should be provided. Note: Acceptable if the excluded studies are referenced. If there is an electronic link to the list but the link is dead, select “no.”
A6. Were the characteristics of the included studies provided? In an aggregated form such as a table, data from the original studies should be provided on the participants, interventions and outcomes. The ranges of characteristics in all the studies analyzed e.g., age, race, sex, relevant socioeconomic data, disease status, duration, severity, or other diseases should be reported. Note: Acceptable if not in table format as long as they are described as above. Paul "Follow-up poorly reported in general"
A7. Was the scientific quality of the included studies assessed and documented? 'A priori' methods of assessment should be provided (e.g., for effectiveness studies if the author(s) chose to include only randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled studies, or allocation concealment as inclusion criteria); for other types of studies alternative items will be relevant. Note: Can include use of a quality scoring tool or checklist, e.g., Jadad scale, risk of bias, sensitivity analysis, etc., or a description of quality items, with some kind of result for EACH study (“low” or “high” is fine, as long as it is clear which studies scored “low” and which scored “high”; a summary score/range for all studies is not acceptable).
A8. Was the scientific quality of the included studies used appropriately in formulating conclusions? The results of the methodological rigor and scientific quality should be considered in the analysis and the conclusions of the review, and explicitly stated in formulating recommendations. Note: Might say something such as “the results should be interpreted with caution due to poor quality of included studies.” Cannot score “yes” for this question if scored “no” for question A7.
A9. Were the methods used to combine the findings of studies appropriate? For the pooled results, a test should be done to ensure the studies were combinable, to assess their homogeneity (i.e., Chi-squared test for homogeneity, I2 ). If heterogeneity exists a random effects model should be used and/or the clinical appropriateness of combining should be taken into consideration (i.e., is it sensible to combine?). Note: Indicate “yes” if they mention or describe heterogeneity, i.e., if they explain that they cannot pool because of heterogeneity/variability between interventions.
A10. Was the likelihood of publication bias assessed? An assessment of publication bias should include a combination of graphical aids (e.g., funnel plot, other available tests) and/or statistical tests (e.g., Egger regression test, Hedges-Olken). Note: If no test values or funnel plot included, score “no”. Score “yes” if mentions that publication bias could not be assessed because there were fewer than 10 included studies.
A11. Was the conflict of interest included? Potential sources of support should be clearly acknowledged in both the systematic review and the included studies. Note: To get a “yes,” must indicate source of funding or support for the systematic review AND for each of the included studies.

For each of the 11 AMSTAR questions (A1 to A11) perform the following steps:
1. Extract 1-3 relevant quotes from the full text.
2. Explain your reasoning in 1 sentence.
3. Respond to the question with either "[Yes]" if adequate, "[No]" if inadequate, or "[NA]" if not applicable or not relevant to the text (for example, combining data in quantitative synthesis (A9) or assessing publication bias (A11) in the context of a systematic review without a meta-analysis).

Before stopping, make sure you've processed all 11 AMSTAR questions. Do not provide a final summary paragraph in the end.
