Eligibility:

Relevant quotes:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;A highly pragmatic approach to eligibility criteria would be to include in the trial anyone with the condition of interest who is likely to be a candidate for the intervention if it was being provided in usual care for this condition.&quot;</span>
2. <span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Excluding people not known or shown to be highly adherent to the intervention.&quot;</span>
3. <span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Excluding people using tests or measures that are not used or available in usual care.&quot;</span>

The eligibility criteria for CORONIS were quite pragmatic, aiming to include any women undergoing caesarean section at the participating sites. However, there were some exclusions that reduced the pragmatism, such as excluding women who did not consent or were not able to be followed up. The trial also excluded women with a clear indication for a particular surgical technique or material to be used. Overall, the eligibility criteria were mostly pragmatic but with a few explanatory elements.
Score: [4]

Recruitment:

Relevant quotes:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The most extreme pragmatic approach to recruitment would be to do this in usual care so that only the people who attend a clinic with the condition of interest are recruited after they present on their own behalf without any overt recruitment effort.&quot;</span>
2. <span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Recruiting through usual appointments at a diverse range of clinics is likely to score at or close to 5 on the PRECIS-2 scale.&quot;</span>

The CORONIS trial recruited women presenting for caesarean section at the participating sites. This is a very pragmatic approach, as it mirrors how patients would be identified and recruited in usual care. The trial recruited from a diverse range of clinics across 19 countries and sites, further increasing the pragmatism of the recruitment approach.
Score: [5]

Setting:

Relevant quotes:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The most extremely pragmatic approach to setting would be to do the trial in an identical setting to which you intend the results to be applied.&quot;</span>
2. <span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Even settings that seem rather restrictive could still be a highly pragmatic design choice if this setting is the usual care setting where patients are treated for the particular health condition.&quot;</span>

The CORONIS trial was conducted in the same settings where caesarean sections are normally performed - hospitals and clinics in Argentina, Chile, Ghana, India, Kenya, Pakistan, and Sudan. These are the usual care settings for this procedure. While academic centers were included, the trial aimed to cover the diversity of usual care settings for caesarean sections in the participating countries.
Score: [5]

Organization:

Relevant quotes:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;A highly pragmatic design would aim to slot the intervention into the usual organisation of care for the condition of interest, making use of no more than the existing healthcare staff and resources in that setting.&quot;</span>
2. <span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The PRECIS-2 organisation score will be reduced to the degree trialists make changes in how care is delivered compared with the usual recipients and care delivery.&quot;</span>

The CORONIS trial utilized the existing staff, resources, and care delivery approaches at the participating sites. The interventions were integrated into the standard caesarean section procedures without requiring additional training, expertise or resources beyond what is normally available. The organization of the trial closely mirrored usual care.
Score: [5]

Flexibility (delivery):

Relevant quotes:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The most pragmatic design approach to delivery flexibility would leave the details of how to implement the intervention up to providers, in other words, what happens in usual care.&quot;</span>
2. <span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;A highly specified, protocol driven intervention. For example, specific direction is given for how to the administer the intervention (such as dose, dosing schedule, surgical procedures, educational material, and delivery)&quot;</span>

The delivery of the surgical techniques in CORONIS allowed some flexibility for the providers, as would be the case in usual care. However, the interventions were still rather protocol-driven, with specific steps to be followed for each technique. The trial restricted co-interventions and had measures to monitor compliance. This reduced the pragmatism to a degree.
Score: [3]

Flexibility (adherence):

This domain is not applicable, as CORONIS is a surgical trial where patients are being operated on. There is no compliance issue after consent has been given.
Score: [NA]

The CORONIS trial had more intensive follow-up than would typically occur after caesarean section in usual care. There were follow-up visits at 6 weeks and 3 months that were not part of standard care. Detailed data was collected on secondary outcomes beyond what is captured in usual practice. This moves the trial in a more explanatory direction for this domain.

Primary outcome:

Relevant quotes:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Trials that choose outcomes of obvious importance to patients, and measure them in a way that is the same or similar to the way they are measured in usual care would be likely to score at or close to 5 on PRECIS-2.&quot;</span>
2. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The focus of the primary analysis was the main effects of the five intervention pairs analysed separately. Pairwise interactions were planned if the analyses showed any statistically significant main effects for the primary outcome only.&quot;</span>

The primary outcome was a composite of death, maternal infectious morbidity, further operative procedures, or blood transfusion. These are outcomes of clear importance to patients. However, some components like infectious morbidity were defined in a more explanatory way using specific diagnostic criteria. And the analysis approach investigating pairwise interactions moves away from the pragmatic end of the spectrum.

The primary analysis was intention-to-treat using all available data, which is a pragmatic approach. However, the analysis also looked at individual components of the composite outcome, which is a more explanatory approach. Additionally, pairwise interactions were examined in a non-pragmatic way. So while the main analysis was pragmatic, there were important explanatory elements as well.

Here is my assessment of the PRECIS-2 scores for each domain based on the provided full text:

Eligibility:
Relevant quotes:
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Patients with type 2 diabetes (n=264) selected by a self-administered questionnaire aimed at measuring emotional distress and diabetes-related reduced daily functioning.&quot;</span>

SMS included detection of patients with emotional distress or reduced daily functioning by supporting them when needed through problem solving and reattribution techniques.&quot;</span>

The eligibility criteria included patients with diabetes-related reduced daily functioning, which is more pragmatic. However, patients were selected using a self-administered questionnaire which is not typically done in usual care and is more explanatory. The inclusion of practice nurses trained in SMS techniques is also not usual care.
Score: [3]

Recruitment:

The recruitment was done to realize a shift towards a biopsychosocial approach in diabetes care, which is different from usual care recruitment. A previous RCT had shown cost-effectiveness of the intervention, implying recruitment was done specifically for the trial.
Score: [2] 

Setting:
Relevant quotes:
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;In collaboration with a regional care group of general practitioners (GPs) in the Netherlands, the SMS ('Self-Management Support') implementation project was initiated to realise a shift from biomedically oriented care towards a biopsychosocial approach in diabetes care.&quot;</span>
<span title='Moderate quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 92.6%):

A previous randomised trial has shown that this intervention was cost-effective for patients with diabetes with minor to moderate depression: 9 months after receiving the intervention, patients' emotional symptoms were significantly reduced.&quot;</span>

The trial was done in collaboration with a regional GP group in the Netherlands to implement a new SMS approach. This specific setting was chosen based on a previous trial showing effectiveness. The setting of regional GP practices is representative of usual diabetes care to some extent.
Score: [3]

Organization:
Relevant quotes:
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Practice nurses in the intervention arm (n=19) were trained to integrate SMS into their routine consultations.&quot;</span>

Practice nurses in the intervention arm received additional training to provide SMS, which is not part of usual care organization. Extra financial reimbursement was also provided for the SMS consultations. This represents a difference in resources and expertise compared to usual care.
Score: [2]

Flexibility (delivery):
Relevant quotes:
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The training sessions were followed up by booster sessions to maintain and improve PNs' skills in SMS. PNs attended these booster sessions three or four times during the year of follow-up.&quot;</span>
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;After the training sessions, PNs started to integrate SMS into their routine care practice. PNs were blinded regarding the outcomes of the recruitment procedure and study participation of their patients. They applied SMS in all their consultations with patients with diabetes.&quot;</span>

PNs received ongoing booster training sessions during the year to improve their SMS skills, indicating some flexibility in intervention delivery was restricted. However, after initial training, PNs integrated SMS into all their routine consultations with diabetes patients, allowing flexibility similar to usual care.
Score: [4]

Flexibility (adherence):
No relevant quotes. The intervention was aimed at PNs providing SMS to patients. There is no information on if or how patient adherence to the intervention was monitored or enforced.
Score: [NA] 

Follow-up:
Relevant quotes:
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The effect of SMS on patients' daily functioning was measured by means of the DFT. The DFT was dichotomised to compare the number of patients who were improved in their daily functioning and had apparently found a satisfactory way to live with the consequences of their diabetes (DFT ≤4) with patients who still perceived a burden of diabetes on their daily functioning (DFT >4).&quot;</span>

Patients' daily functioning was measured using the Diabetes-related Distress (DFT) questionnaire dichotomized around a cut-off score. No details are provided on the frequency or intensity of follow-up compared to usual care.
Score: [NA]

Primary outcome:
Relevant quote:
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The primary outcome measure was a dichotomised score on a Visual Analogue Scale that measured the perceived effect of diabetes on daily functioning.&quot;</span>

The primary outcome was patients' perceived effect of diabetes on daily functioning, which appears to be a patient-centered pragmatic outcome. However, it was measured using a Visual Analogue Scale, which may not be used in routine care.
Score: [4]

The trial included a broad patient population aged 12 to 80 with impaired asthma-related quality of life or inadequate asthma control. Patients were under the care of their usual physician, suggesting real-world conditions. However, the use of specific questionnaire score cutoffs for inclusion (MiniAQLQ ≤6, ACQ ≥1) is not typical of usual care and makes the trial more explanatory.

The use of an automated telephone system for randomization is not typical of usual care organization. However, the trial aimed to fit into normal clinical practice by allowing choice of individual drugs and devices according to guidelines. Overall, the organization seems to be a mix of pragmatic and explanatory elements.

3. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Clinical and lung-function data were recorded by clinic staff who were aware of the treatment assignments. Data collection and statistical analyses were performed by study personnel who were unaware of the treatment assignments; questionnaire-based data were collected under blinded conditions, and routine practice data (including a history of exacerbations) were extracted with the use of dedicated software.&quot;</span>

The trial used an automated telephone system for baseline assessment, which is not typical of usual care follow-up. Individualized asthma-action plans were provided, but it's unclear if this represents an increase in follow-up intensity compared to usual care. Blinding of questionnaire-based data collection and extraction of routine practice data is a more explanatory approach.

Score: [3]

Primary outcome:

Relevant quotes:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The primary outcome measure was the MiniAQLQ score. Secondary outcome measures included the ACQ score, the score on the not-yet-validated Royal College of Physicians 3-item asthma questionnaire (RCP3) (range of scores, 0 to 3, with higher scores indicating worse asthma control), the score on the validated 14-item Mini Rhinoconjunctivitis Quality of Life Questionnaire (MiniRQLQ) (range of scores, 0 to 6, with higher scores indicating worse rhinitis-related impairment and with an MID of 0.7), and the frequency of asthma exacerbations, which were defined as the need for an oral course of glucocorticoids or hospitalization for asthma.&quot;</span>

The primary outcome, MiniAQLQ score, is a validated patient-reported measure of asthma-related quality of life and is relevant to patients. Most secondary outcomes also assess patient-relevant factors like asthma control, rhinitis-related quality of life, and exacerbation frequency. The use of the not-yet-validated RCP3 is a more explanatory element.

Score: [4]

Primary analysis:

Analysis of covariance was used, with treatment as a fixed effect and the baseline value as a covariate.&quot;</span>

The trial used an intention-to-treat analysis, which is a pragmatic approach that includes all participants according to their randomized groups. Imputation was used for missing data, which is also consistent with a pragmatic approach.

Eligibility:

Relevant quotes:
1. <span title='Moderate quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 82.4%):

ction criteria were having a diagnosis of moderate-to-severe COPD (a Body mass index, Airflow obstruction, dyspnoea and Exercise capacity [BODE] index score of 3–7) according to international guidelines 9 and having been clinically stable for the previous 4 weeks (see the online supplementary material).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;Exclusion criteria were having a diagnosis of moderate-to-severe COPD (a Body mass index, Airflow obstruction, Dyspnoea and Exercise capacity index [BODE] index of 7–10) according to international guidelines and having been clinically stable for the previous 4 weeks (see the online supplementary material).&quot;</span>

The trial had fairly strict eligibility criteria, excluding patients without a confirmed moderate-to-severe COPD diagnosis based on the BODE index, and only including clinically stable patients. The initial intensive rehabilitation program was also conducted in a hospital setting, which differs from usual care for COPD patients. These factors make the eligibility criteria more explanatory than pragmatic.

Score: [2]

Recruitment:

Relevant quotes:
1. <span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 95.9%):

A multicentre open-label pragmatic parallel-group randomized clinical trial was conducted. Two groups were created at completion of an 8-week intensive outpatient hospital PR programme.' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;This was a multicentre open-label pragmatic parallel-group randomized clinical trial was conducted. Two groups were created at completion of an 8-week intensive outpatient hospital PR programme.&quot;</span>

The trial recruited patients from multiple centers who were completing an intensive outpatient hospital-based pulmonary rehabilitation program. While this is more pragmatic than recruiting through other means like advertisements, it still represents a more explanatory approach than recruiting directly through usual care visits.

Score: [3]

Setting:

Relevant quote: 
1. <span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 99.3%):

This was a multicentre open-label pragmatic parallel-group randomized clinical trial involving 13 hospitals and was conducted between 2014 and 2017' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;This was a multicentre open-label pragmatic parallel-group randomized clinical trial involving 13 hospitals and was conducted between 2014 and 2017.&quot;</span>

The trial was conducted across 13 hospitals, representing a fairly diverse range of settings. However, all the sites were hospitals rather than other care settings where COPD is routinely managed, like primary care clinics. So while the multicentre approach increases pragmatism, the hospital-only settings make it more explanatory than a true usual care approach.

Score: [3]

Organization:

Relevant quotes:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The hospital-based outpatient programme consisted of three training sessions a week which included 30 min of weight lifting and 30 min of leg cycle ergometry along with four educational sessions which included chest physiotherapy training (see online supplementary material).&quot;</span>
2. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Patients in the IG were asked to continue at home with a similar training schedule to that completed in the hospital.&quot;</span>

The intervention required specialized staff to provide weight training, ergometry, and educational sessions that included chest physiotherapy training. Patients were also provided with training equipment like dumbbells and exercise bicycle to continue the program at home. This represents a significant increase in organizational resources compared to usual care for COPD.

2. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Patients in the CG received usual care, that is, they were advised to exercise regularly (at least walking for 1 hour a day) and provided with general educational material, following current clinical practice at participating sites.&quot;</span>

The intervention group had a strict protocol to perform three weekly training sessions and send data through an app. In contrast, the control group had more flexibility, with general advice to exercise regularly for at least 1 hour/day. The regimented IG protocol is more explanatory, while the CG approach is more pragmatic and flexible.

Score: [3]

Flexibility (adherence):

No relevant quotes identified. The manuscript does not discuss any measures to monitor or enforce patient adherence to the intervention protocol.

Score: [NA] 

Follow-up:

Relevant quotes:
1. <span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 96.3%):

At each visit, patients were advised to continue doing exercise and attending follow-up appointments even if they decided not to comply with the assigned maintenance exercises, supporting the intention-to-treat principle (see online supplementary material).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;At each follow-up visit, patients were advised to continue doing exercise and attending follow-up appointments even if they decided not to comply with the assigned maintenance exercises, supporting the intention-to-treat principle (see online supplementary material).&quot;</span>
2. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;After the randomization visit, follow-up appointments were arranged for both groups at 3, 9 and 12 months. At each follow-up visit, the general health status of the patient was assessed, medical treatment was revised and optimized, educational reinforcement was provided, 6-minute walk test (6MWT) and spirometry tests were carried out and HRQoL measures were taken.&quot;</span>

The follow-up schedule of visits every 3 months is more frequent than typical COPD care. The visits also involved extensive data collection including 6MWT, spirometry, and HRQoL questionnaires that go beyond usual care. However, patients were advised to continue follow-up even if non-adherent, supporting an intent-to-treat approach. Overall, the follow-up is more explanatory than usual care, but with some pragmatic elements.

Score: [3]

Primary outcome:

Relevant quote:
1. <span title='Major quote deviation, possible hallucination. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 58.8%):

Change Over Time in the 6-Minute Walk Test Distance in Each Group Stratified by the Presence of at Least One Exacerbation Episode. Randomization 12 Months' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: red'>&quot;The primary outcome was the change in the 6-min walk distance (6MWD) between baseline (randomization visit, 0) and 12 months later.&quot;</span>

The 6-minute walk test measures functional exercise capacity, which is an outcome that is meaningful to COPD patients. However, it requires a standardized testing protocol and may not be routinely measured in usual COPD care. It strikes a balance between explanatory and pragmatic elements.

Score: [3]

Primary analysis:

Relevant quotes:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Analysed (n = 40) Excluded from analysis (no 12 months results) (n = 5)&quot;</span>

The primary analysis excluded a small number of patients (5 per group) due to missing 12-month data. This is a modified intent-to-treat approach that is slightly more explanatory than a full ITT using all randomized patients. However, the overall rate of exclusion was low.

The trial had fairly broad eligibility criteria, including people with a range of disability levels (EDSS 1 to 6.5) who were registered at the MS clinic and living in the selected municipalities. However, the criteria did exclude those with very mild or advanced disability. The trial aimed to include people likely to receive the intervention in usual care, but had some restrictions.

Participants were recruited from those registered at the MS outpatient clinic in the selected municipalities. An electronic randomization system was used to assign participants to groups. This seems to align with how recruitment would occur in usual care for this population, using existing clinic registrations. No extra recruitment efforts are mentioned.

Relevant quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Assessments at all time points took place at a Norwegian hospital.&quot;</span>

The trial was conducted at a single Norwegian hospital. While this may be the usual care setting for this intervention and population, including only a single center may somewhat limit applicability compared to a multi-center trial. However, not enough information is provided to fully judge if this single hospital setting matches the intended usual care setting.

The intervention was delivered by 6 neurological physical therapists who received 5 days of specific training in the GroupCoreDIST approach. They had varied levels of experience and certification. This represents an increase in provider expertise and training compared to usual care. However, the physical therapists seem to be existing staff, not additional providers.

The delivery of the intervention allowed the physical therapists to tailor and individualize the exercises to each participant's specific impairments and needs. There was a focus on participant-specific adjustments rather than a strict standardized protocol. This suggests high flexibility in delivery to match individual circumstances.

The trial does not mention any strategies to monitor or enforce participant adherence, such as excluding non-adherent participants. 57% of non-responders had low disability (EDSS 0-3.5), but non-response itself did not seem to be a basis for exclusion. A few participants missed assessments but were not excluded on this basis. This suggests flexibility in adherence was allowed, as would be expected in usual care.

Assessments were conducted at baseline, end of intervention (7 weeks), and at 18 and 30 weeks post-intervention. This exceeds what would be typical in usual care. The assessors were masked and specifically trained in standardized procedures. Overall, the follow-up was more intense than usual care, but not excessively so.

The primary outcome measures (TIS-NV and Mini-BESTest) assess dynamic sitting balance, trunk control and overall balance. These outcomes are likely to be important and relevant to people with MS. The measures have been validated in MS populations. However, the use of these specific scales and the scoring criteria may not exactly match what is typical in usual care.

2. "Analyzed at all time-points (n = 39)
• Excluded from analysis due to no posttest (n = 1)"

The primary analysis was conducted as an intention-to-treat analysis, including all participants except one individual who missed all post-intervention tests. This is a pragmatic approach that includes nearly all participants in the analysis regardless of adherence. Excluding one participant with no outcome data is reasonable and unlikely to significantly impact the results.

We administered the screening questionnaires via telephone. Inclusion criteria were diagnosis of PPMS or SPMS, Internet access and some level of distress determined by a score of 3 or greater on the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12).&quot;</span>

The trial had relatively broad eligibility criteria, including people with primary progressive or secondary progressive MS who had some level of distress. The main exclusion criteria were cognitive impairment and lack of internet access. While these criteria are somewhat stricter than what would be used in usual care, they are not overly restrictive. The trial aimed to include a representative sample of people with progressive MS who could potentially benefit from the intervention.

Recruitment was done via telephone screening using questionnaires to assess eligibility based on MS diagnosis, internet access, and distress levels. This approach is somewhat more systematic than what would typically occur in usual care, but it is not a highly targeted or resource-intensive recruitment strategy. The recruitment period of about 6 months is reasonably representative of a real-world timeline.

The trial recruited participants from both MS Society channels and NHS clinics across the UK, indicating that the setting has good representativeness of the real-world healthcare environment for MS in the UK. The trial was approved by a research ethics committee, as would be expected for a trial in this setting. Overall, the setting appears to be a good match to where the intervention would be applied in practice.

AB and PC met weekly, and PC listened to excerpts of each and every session for supervision and fidelity purposes.&quot;</span>

The intervention used standard CBT techniques adapted for people with MS, and was delivered by a health psychologist with supervision from a clinical psychologist with mindfulness expertise. The organization of the intervention delivery appears to be feasible within existing healthcare resources, without requiring substantial additional training or changes to typical care delivery. Some extra resources were used for supervision and fidelity monitoring, but these do not seem excessive for an intervention study.

The intervention followed a structured 8-session format with defined content for each session. However, the content was specifically adapted for people with progressive MS. The waiting-list control group received usual care. This indicates a moderately flexible delivery, with a general framework but some tailoring to the MS population. It is not a highly rigid, protocol-driven intervention, but also not as flexible as usual care.

Participants completed questionnaires at baseline, post-intervention, and 3-month follow-up. This schedule is somewhat more intensive than typical usual care, but not excessively burdensome. A 3-month follow-up is a reasonable time frame for assessing meaningful outcomes. However, the high loss to follow-up rate of 38% suggests that the follow-up procedures may have been challenging for many participants to complete.

The primary outcome was the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ) score, which measures general psychological distress and has been validated in MS populations as a responsive measure. This appears to be an outcome that is relevant and meaningful to patients. Secondary outcomes included measures of MS-specific constructs like disability, impact of MS, anxiety, depression, quality of life, and service costs. These all seem to be important outcomes from a patient perspective.

The trial had fairly strict inclusion and exclusion criteria, including specific EDSS and walking test scores, being relapse-free and on stable medications, and excluding those unable to walk or with certain comorbidities. While some criteria like confirmed MS diagnosis and ability to walk would be typical in usual care, others like EDSS and SSST scores are more restrictive than the general MS population. The criteria overall seem to select a somewhat narrower population than all MS patients likely to receive the intervention in usual care.

The trial used a cluster randomization by clinic, suggesting the intervention was delivered by usual staff at the clinics rather than by specialized trial personnel. Assessments were done by a research assistant, but it's unclear if this person was part of the usual care staff. Overall, the organization appears largely similar to usual care, with the possible exception of the research assistant's involvement.

However, some flexibility was allowed in the specific exercises performed and in progressing load based on individual capacity. On balance, the delivery appears to be somewhat protocol-driven but with a moderate degree of flexibility.

Relevant quotes:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Two adverse events occurred in the PRT group. One participant experienced exacerbation of fatigue following PRT sessions and dropped out; one experienced intermittent low back pain during PRT, but continued in the study.&quot;</span>
2. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Of particular interest is the finding of an increase in gait speed from BMCT despite no change in strength compared to CON. However, the increase in maximal gait speed in PRT (0.06 m/s) on the T25FW was also not significant when compared to CON.&quot;</span>

The text mentions two adverse events in the PRT group, one of which led to dropout. However, it does not specify any measures to monitor or enforce participant adherence, or any thresholds for dropping non-adherent participants. The analysis appears to include all participants, suggesting an intent-to-treat approach with respect to adherence. Overall, there is insufficient information to determine how closely adherence was monitored or enforced.

Score: [NA] 

Follow-up:

Relevant quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants were included from September 2016 to October 2018, after being invited via seven MS clinics (specified in &quot;</span>Acknowledgements<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot; section) and targeted advertisements sent out via the Danish MS Society.&quot;</span>

The text does not provide details on the frequency or duration of follow-up visits, or how these compared to usual care. It also does not specify the duration of the trial from a participant perspective. There is insufficient information to assess the follow-up burden compared to usual care.

The primary outcomes were two measures of walking performance - the Timed 25-Foot Walk and Six Spot Step Test. Walking speed and complex walking ability are outcomes that are directly relevant and meaningful to MS patients. The tests appear to have been conducted in a manner very similar to usual care, allowing walking aids but removing orthotics and nerve stimulators. This suggests the outcomes assessment mimicked real-world conditions.

Primary analysis:

Relevant quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Analyses were carried out as intention-to-treat, where all participants were included regardless of their adherence to the allocated intervention. Carry forward imputations were not used to replace missing data in the primary intention to treat analysis.&quot;</span>

The primary analysis was conducted as intention-to-treat, including all participants regardless of adherence. No methods were used to impute missing data. This suggests a very pragmatic approach to the analysis, using all available data without any post-randomization exclusions.

Eligibility:

Relevant quotes:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;A total of 120 PwMS were recruited via the Sheffield MS Clinic and flyers/community adverts displayed at the local South Yorkshire MS Society branches. All patients were assessed by a consultant neurologist with an interest in MS prior to entering the trial. The inclusion criteria for the trial were clinical diagnosis of MS, as defined by the modified McDonald criteria, with an Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score of 1.0–6.5, and able to walk a 10-metre distance; aged 18–65 years; clinically stable for at least four weeks prior to entering the study; physically able to participate in exercise three times per week; able to provide written informed consent.&quot;</span>

The trial recruited participants from MS clinics and community advertisements, assessing them based on standard clinical criteria like MS diagnosis, EDSS score, age, clinical stability, physical ability to exercise, and ability to provide consent. While these criteria would be used in usual care, the EDSS score range of 1.0-6.5 and age range of 18-65 are narrower than the full spectrum of MS patients likely to be treated in usual care. The physical ability and consent requirements may also exclude some patients compared to usual care.

1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;A total of 120 PwMS were recruited via the Sheffield MS Clinic and flyers/community adverts displayed at the local South Yorkshire MS Society branches.&quot;</span>

Participants were recruited from a single MS clinic and through community advertisements and patient society branches in one region. While recruiting from an MS clinic is pragmatic, using flyers and community advertisements is an extra recruitment effort that goes beyond what would occur in usual care. Limiting to one region also reduces generalizability compared to recruiting from multiple centers.

Score: [3] 

Setting:

Relevant quotes:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants on disease-modifying therapy (interferon beta, glatiramer acetate and natalizumab) had been stable on this treatment for at least three months.&quot;</span>
2. <span title='Moderate quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 78.3%):

Participants were encouraged to seek out opportunities to exercise in the local community' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ff9e81'>&quot;Participants were encouraged to exercise in community-based settings.&quot;</span>

The trial was conducted in community-based settings, which matches where most MS patients would receive an exercise intervention in usual care. However, participants were recruited from a single MS clinic, so the setting is not as broad as all the centers that would treat MS patients in usual care. Participants were also required to be on stable disease-modifying therapy, which may differ from the full spectrum treated in usual practice.

Score: [4]

Organization:

During weeks 1–6, participants attended two supervised sessions per week at a university exercise research facility and engaged in one additional self-directed exercise session in their home or local community.&quot;</span>

The intervention was delivered by an exercise physiologist with some physiotherapist input, which is likely a higher level of expertise than would be consistently available in usual care. The sessions were held in a university research facility, which differs from typical community settings. Participants did complete some self-directed sessions at home or in the community, but the overall organization of the intervention included extra resources.

Score: [2]

Flexibility (delivery):

Relevant quotes:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Supervised exercise sessions involved up to three participants and lasted for approximately one hour. Studies show that aerobic exercise, resistance exercise and combined programmes bring health benefits to PwMS. Hence, the programme was designed to be pragmatic and accessible, taking into account exercise preferences and giving choices.&quot;</span>
2. <span title='Moderate quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 93.5%):

Aerobic exercise was the core exercise modality as it is accessible (i.e. includes community-based walking exercise) and does not require equipment.' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ff9e81'>&quot;Aerobic exercise was the core component and was accessible (i.e. includes community-based walking exercise) and does not require equipment.&quot;</span>

The intervention involved supervised group sessions of aerobic exercise, resistance training, and combined training, allowing some choice of exercise type based on patient preference. The aerobic component was designed to be accessible in community settings without equipment. This represents a moderately flexible approach that is mostly pragmatic but somewhat more structured than usual care.

Score: [4]

Flexibility (adherence):

Relevant quotes:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Adherence to the supervised and home-exercise sessions was very good, with participants attending an average of 16.2 of the 18 supervised sessions (90%; range 7–18 sessions) and participating in an average of 14.6 of the 18 prescribed home-exercise sessions (81%, range 2–18 sessions). Home exercise during the intervention period comprised walking.&quot;</span>

Adherence to the intervention was encouraged but very good adherence was not required. Participants attended an average of 90% of supervised sessions and 81% of home sessions, with wide ranges, suggesting that perfect adherence was not mandated. No adherence-based exclusions were reported. This represents a pragmatic approach, applying no more than usual encouragement for adherence.

Participants were followed for 9 months after recruitment, which is longer than typical follow-up for an exercise intervention in usual care. The trial also collected more extensive data than usual, as indicated by the published protocol. However, the follow-up did not involve any additional treatment or interaction with participants beyond data collection.

Score: [3]

Primary outcome:

Relevant quotes:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Objective: The objective of this study was to assess the effects of a practically implemented exercise programme on self-directed exercise behaviour and important health outcomes in PwMS to nine months of follow-up.&quot;</span>
2. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Primary outcome was self-reported exercise behaviour at three months using the Godin Leisure Time Exercise Questionnaire (GLTEQ).&quot;</span>

The primary outcome of self-reported exercise behavior at 3 months using the GLTEQ is relevant to participants, as increasing self-directed exercise is a patient-centered goal. However, using a self-report questionnaire is less direct than measuring actual exercise behavior. The 3-month time point is also a relatively short-term outcome.

Score: [4]

Primary analysis:

Relevant quotes:
1. <span title='Major quote deviation, possible hallucination. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 42.2%):

The primary analysis took a pragmatic approach by including all participants lost to follow-up at 3 months, treating them as non-exercisers rather than excluding them. This is similar to an intention-to-treat approach. No other details are provided on the analysis methods.

Exclusion criteria were: poor English language skills or cognitive function (score of less than 24 on Mini Mental State Examination [20]); BDI score of at least 29 on two consecutive occasions; active suicidal ideas; current or life-time diagnosis of psychosis, organic mental disorder or substance dependency; Kurtzke Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score of 8.5 or above [21]).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;Exclusion criteria were: poor English language skills or cognitive function (score of less than 24 on Mini Mental State Examination [20]); BDI score of at least 29 on two consecutive occasions; active suicidal ideas; current or life-time diagnosis of psychosis, organic mental disorder or addictive disorder; Kurtzke Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score of 8.5 or above [21]).&quot;</span>

The trial recruited participants with MS and depression from out-patient clinics and postal screening, which is fairly pragmatic. However, there were several exclusion criteria that would not be applied in usual care, such as excluding those with poor English skills, low cognitive function, very severe depression (BDI ≥29), psychosis, and high disability (EDSS ≥8.5). These criteria likely excluded some patients who would have received the intervention in usual care.

2. <span title='Moderate quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 90.9%):

Key exclusion criteria were previous exposure to GA40, a progressive form of MS or neuromyelitis optica, the use of experimental or investigational drugs, participation in clinical drug studies within the 6 months before screening, recent use of immunosuppressive medications or immunoglobulins/monoclonal antibodies, or previous use of alemtuzumab, cladribine, cyclophosphamide, or mitoxantrone.' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ff9e81'>&quot;Key exclusion criteria were previous exposure to GA40, a progressive form of MS or neuromyelitis optica, the use of experimental or investigational drugs, participation in clinical drug studies within the 6 months before screening, recent use of immunosuppressive medications (other than systemic corticosteroids), antibiotics, or vaccines use of alemtuzumab, cladribine, cyclophosphamide, or mitoxantrone.&quot;</span>

The trial had fairly standard inclusion/exclusion criteria for an RRMS population, allowing a broad range of patients to participate. However, some criteria like EDSS score ≤5.5 and relapse-free/stable condition would exclude more severe or active RRMS patients that may still be treated with GA40 in usual care. The exclusion of patients with prior GA40 exposure or recent use of other MS drugs is also stricter than usual care. Overall, the eligibility criteria were moderately pragmatic but had some explanatory elements.

Quotes:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The CONFIDENCE study was a multinational, multicenter, randomized, parallel-group, phase 4, open-label study conducted at 88 study centers in 14 countries (Russia, Poland, Italy, France, Croatia, US [including Puerto Rico], Mexico, Spain, Austria, Turkey, Belgium, Argentina, Germany, and Finland) across different geographic regions.&quot;</span>

The trial was conducted at 88 centers across 14 countries in different geographic regions. This matches the settings where GA40 would be used as a treatment for RRMS in usual care. Conducting the trial at both specialist and general centers internationally gives the results broad applicability.

The trial mentions patients being randomized to receive either GA40 or GA20, but does not describe any additional organizational resources used to deliver the intervention beyond what would be available in usual care. Administering GA40 and GA20 appears to have been done in line with routine practices.

RM ANOVA analyses of MS-TAQ total scores during the 6-month treatment period showed significantly lower MS-TAQ scores in patients treated with GA40 than with GA20 during that time, indicating higher adherence to GA40 versus GA20 (table e-4).&quot;</span>

Patients' adherence was measured using the MS-TAQ questionnaire at Months 1, 3 and 6. This goes beyond the follow-up that would typically occur in usual care for RRMS patients on GA therapy. The use of this questionnaire at multiple timepoints to assess adherence represents a more explanatory approach to follow-up.

The overall treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) profile in both treatment groups was consistent with previous findings (Wolinsky et al., 2015) (Table 2).

2. <span title='Moderate quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 87.5%):

study design was the desire to assess the potential advantages of a less frequently administered (GA40) versus a more frequently administered formulation (GA20). The question of relatively efficacy between the GA40 and GA20 formulations has been evaluated in previous trials designed for that purpose (Khan et al., 2013; Zivadinov et al., 2018, 2015).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ff9e81'>&quot;The CONFIDENCE study was designed to assess the potential advantages of a less frequently administered (GA40) versus a more frequently administered (GA20) formulation of glatiramer acetate. The question of interest between the GA40 and GA20 formulations has been evaluated in previous trials designed for that purpose (Khan et al., 2013; Zivadinov et al., 2018, 2015).&quot;</span>

The primary outcome was the overall TEAE profile, with a specific focus on comparing injection-site adverse events between GA40 and GA20. While safety and tolerability outcomes are important to patients, the choice to look specifically at injection-site reactions as a key outcome makes the trial more explanatory. The authors note this question has been evaluated in previous explanatory trials. An outcome of more direct clinical relevance to patients, such as relapse rates or disability progression, would have made the trial more pragmatic.

Primary analysis:
Quotes:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;A total of 876 patients were screened for eligibility, and 861 were randomly assigned to receive GA40 (n = 431) or GA20 (n = 430). In the GA40 group, 430 patients received the treatment and were included in the safety analysis set, and 428 patients were included in the FAS. In the GA20 group, 427 patients received the treatment and were included in the safety analysis set and FAS (Fig. 1). A total of 794 (92%) patients completed the core phase with similar percentages of completers in each group (92.6% [399/431] in GA40 and 91.9% [395/430] in GA20, p = 0.695).&quot;</span>

The primary analysis appears to be an intention-to-treat analysis using all randomized patients (the full analysis set or FAS). 92% of patients completed the trial with similar percentages of completers in each group. No adjustments seem to have been made for protocol deviations. This represents a pragmatic approach to the primary analysis.

The trial recruited participants through an MS support organization and specialist clinic, and had relatively broad inclusion criteria requiring only a diagnosis of relapsing-remitting MS, mild to moderate disability based on a standard scale, and medical clearance. This suggests the participants were fairly representative of the real-world population with relapsing-remitting MS and some walking impairment. However, the Ambulation Index score cutoff of 2-4 would exclude those with very mild or more severe walking disability who may still be treated in usual care.

Participants were recruited through a state-level MS organization and a specialist MS clinic. This represents a pragmatic approach leveraging existing channels that reach the target population in the real world. However, recruitment was not done fully through usual care visits. Some additional effort was likely required beyond routine care.

The trial aimed to determine effectiveness of the intervention for people with MS in general, not just a single center. Participants were recruited from a state-level organization and specialist clinic, not a single center. This suggests the setting was intended to broadly represent where the target population is routinely treated. However, details are lacking on the number and specific nature of settings involved.

The intervention was delivered in typical community gyms in both metropolitan and regional areas, by exercise trainers, without mentioning additional resources or expertise beyond what would be available in usual care. The exercises targeted key muscle groups for walking using standard equipment described in Table 1. This suggests the organization of intervention delivery matched closely with what would be available in usual care.

Flexibility (delivery):

Relevant quotes:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;All exercises were completed on weight machines. The training intensity was based on recommendations of the American College of Sports Medicine (2009)7 and consisted of two sets of 10–12 repetitions of each exercise, at a training intensity of 10–12 repetition maximum (that is, only 12 consecutive repetitions of each exercise could be completed before muscle fatigue was reached). The weight lifted was increased when two sets of 12 repetitions of an exercise could be completed.&quot;</span>

The intervention used a highly specified protocol, with specific exercises, weight machines, numbers of repetitions and sets, and a defined method for progressing the intensity based on number of repetitions completed. This suggests a very explanatory approach with little flexibility in delivery compared to usual care.

Score: [2]  

Flexibility (adherence):

1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants attended 92% of training sessions, with no serious adverse events.&quot;</span>
2. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;At 10 weeks, no differences were detected in walking performance. However, compared with the comparison group PRT demonstrated increased leg press strength (16.8%, SD 4.5), increased reverse leg press strength (29.8%, SD 12.7), and increased muscle endurance of the reverse leg press (38.7%, SD 32.8).&quot;</span>

The text does not provide details on measures to enforce or monitor participant adherence, or any consequences of non-adherence. The 92% attendance rate suggests adherence was high, but it is unclear if this was due to enforced adherence strategies or natural motivation. The lack of differences in walking performance at 10 weeks despite strength gains also hints that adherence to the walking program may have been uncontrolled. Overall there is insufficient information to determine how pragmatic or explanatory the approach to adherence was.

Outcomes were recorded at baseline, week 10 and week 22.&quot;</span>

Follow-up assessments were conducted at 10 weeks (end of intervention) and 22 weeks. This schedule exceeds what would be typical in usual care. However, the 22-week follow-up allows assessing maintenance of effects, which is relevant for a progressive condition like MS. No other details are provided about the follow-up procedures and how they compare to usual care.

The primary aim was to evaluate effects on walking, which is an outcome that matters to patients. Walking endurance was measured with the 2-minute walk test, which is a standardized and objective test, but it may not be routinely used in usual care. The other walking outcomes like walking speed were measured using more explanatory methods like the GAITRite electronic walkway.

The primary analysis was intention-to-treat including all randomized participants. Missing data was handled with last observation carried forward, which is a simple but potentially biased approach. The article does not mention any additional explanatory analyses that excluded participants based on adherence or protocol deviations. This suggests a fairly pragmatic approach to analysis, but with a suboptimal missing data method.

The trial recruited a fairly broad population of adults with MS who were able to walk 5km unassisted. Some exclusion criteria were applied, such as requiring a neurologist's diagnosis, which may not fully match the population treated in usual care. However, the sample seems mostly representative of the real-world population of interest.

Participants were recruited through a combination of research institute announcements, MS centers, MS societies, and a sports organization. This goes somewhat beyond recruitment directly through usual care appointments, but leverages existing touchpoints for the target population. The approach strikes a balance between pragmatism and explanatory.

The training intervention was largely home-based with email instructions, making it similar to a real-world setting. However, two group training sessions were held at an outdoor track at a university, which is a more explanatory element. Overall, the setting was mostly but not perfectly matched to usual care.

The intervention appears to have been delivered per a defined protocol, with some extra organizational elements like motivational phone calls and organized group training sessions that go beyond what would typically be available in usual care. However, these additional elements seem relatively minor. The organization is a mix of pragmatic and explanatory.

The study participants were self-selected clients from a multiple sclerosis clinic who had a confirmed diagnosis of MS. While some pragmatic elements are present like recruiting from a real-world clinic population, the participants were a subset of MS patients (having had MS for a mean of 19 years) rather than a fully representative sample. The self-selection aspect also makes the approach somewhat explanatory.

Recruitment was done by providing information through a local MS Society chapter, and interested clients self-selected to participate. This approach has some pragmatic elements by recruiting from a real-world patient pool, but the involvement of the MS Society and the self-selection aspect lean more explanatory than recruiting directly from the clinic population.

The trial was conducted in a real-world MS clinic setting, which is a pragmatic choice. However, it's unclear if this single clinic is representative of the range of settings MS patients typically receive care in. More information is needed to fully assess the setting's match to usual care.

Follow-up in this study involved a validated self-efficacy survey administered at 5 timepoints, including 4 and 8 weeks after the intervention. This is more frequent and extensive data collection than would likely occur in usual care. The use of a survey tool not routinely used in usual MS care also suggests a more explanatory approach to follow-up.

The primary outcome was self-efficacy as measured by the Multiple Sclerosis Self Efficacy (MSSE) survey. While self-efficacy is likely an important outcome to MS patients, the MSSE appears to be a research survey tool not widely used in routine MS care. Measuring self-efficacy with this specialized instrument is a more explanatory than pragmatic approach.

Key exclusion criteria were being within 3 months of ceasing a multiple sclerosis disease-modifying drug, receiving steroid treatment within the preceding 3 months, or participating in another clinical trial.&quot;</span>

The trial recruited from a range of healthcare organizations that would normally treat people with progressive multiple sclerosis, suggesting a pragmatic approach. However, the inclusion and exclusion criteria were more restrictive than what would be expected in usual care, such as excluding those who recently stopped disease-modifying drugs or received steroid treatment. This shifts the trial somewhat towards the explanatory end of the spectrum.

The delivery of the intervention does not appear to have been highly flexible, as a specific standing frame program was evaluated. However, the usual care group was not given any intervention, which is consistent with what would occur outside a trial. The authors acknowledge that some effects could be due to placebo or attention rather than the intrinsic effects of the standing frame, suggesting the intervention had some degree of flexibility. Overall, the delivery appears to be a balance between explanatory and pragmatic.

The 36-week primary endpoint follow-up extends well beyond what would be typical in usual care for this population. Serious adverse events were tracked over this period as well. This represents a more explanatory approach to follow-up than would normally occur outside of a trial.

Score: [2]

Primary outcome:

Relevant quotes:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The primary clinical outcome was motor function measured by the Amended Motor Club Assessment (AMCA) score at week 36, analysed in the modified intention-to-treat population (excluding only patients who were deemed ineligible after randomisation, those who withdrew from the trial and were unwilling for their previously collected data to be used, or those who did not provide baseline and week 36 measurements).&quot;</span>

The primary outcome of motor function using the AMCA score appears to be a clinically meaningful and relevant measure for progressive multiple sclerosis. However, it is unlikely this specific scale would always be used in routine clinical practice outside of a trial setting. On balance, the primary outcome leans pragmatic but with some explanatory characteristics.

The primary analysis used a modified intention-to-treat approach, excluding only those deemed ineligible after randomization, those who completely withdrew, or those missing both baseline and 36-week data. This is a fairly pragmatic approach, although not as pragmatic as a full intention-to-treat with all randomized participants. Some secondary analyses adjusted for baseline scores alone, which is also more pragmatic. Overall, the analysis approach leans more pragmatic than explanatory.

Persons with MS were excluded if they had a previous relapse or began steroid therapy in the 12 weeks prior to participating in the first assessment, were pregnant, or had a comorbidity that severely impacted their ability to safely participate in exercise.&quot;</span>
The eligibility criteria are somewhat restrictive, excluding those with recent relapses, steroid therapy, pregnancy, or severe comorbidities that impact exercise safety. However, the inclusion criteria of confirmed MS diagnosis over age 18 is fairly broad. The trial strikes a balance between some pragmatic and some explanatory eligibility criteria.

The CG was asked not to change their exercise habit for the 10-week period between assessments.&quot;</span>
The organization of the intervention involved weekly 1-hour group classes led by physiotherapists, fitness instructors, or yoga instructors. This likely required some additional resources and organization beyond usual care. The control group was asked not to change exercise habits, which may differ from usual care.

Flexibility (delivery):
Quotes: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The PT-led exercise provided was pre-defined. It consisted of a circuit-style class of exercises that were either resisted by body weight or by the addition of free weights. The exercises were to sit to stand/squat, bridging, resisted shoulder flexion, walking/cycling, resisted elbow flexion, lunges or resisted knee extension, hip extension and calf raises; working to an intensity whereby the aim was to be failing on the 12th repetition of the exercise, with the load increased by 2–5%, when 12 repetitions were achieved with ease.&quot;</span>
The PT-led intervention had a pre-defined circuit of specific exercises. The delivery appears to have followed a strict protocol with progressions based on number of repetitions achieved. This suggests an explanatory approach to delivery flexibility.

Follow-up:
Quotes: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Outcome was assessed at week 24 for the intervention groups only, as it was felt that withholding a potentially beneficial treatment for longer than 12 weeks, from the controls, could be considered unethical. As all groups were not treated similarly between weeks 12 and 24, and due to the high attrition rates at weeks 12 and 24, the results of our follow-up phase will be presented in a separate paper.&quot;</span>
The intervention groups had follow-up assessments at 12 and 24 weeks, which is more frequent and intense than typical follow-up for exercise interventions in MS patients. The controls only had follow-up at 12 weeks due to ethical concerns. This follow-up approach leans more explanatory than pragmatic.

The trial had fairly strict eligibility criteria, enrolling only patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis who had an inadequate response to prior therapy. The exclusion criteria are not fully detailed but include it being a placebo-controlled trial, suggesting explanatory rather than pragmatic design. However, enrolling patients who reflect the real-world population of interest (RRMS with inadequate response to other therapies) is more of a pragmatic choice.

The trial used randomization to assign patients to the alemtuzumab and interferon-beta treatments, which differs from how treatment would be selected and organized in routine care. Additionally, the delivery of alemtuzumab involved monitoring and management that appears to exceed what would be available in usual care for these patients.

The trial was conducted at a single center over a 2 year period. Patients had to meet specific diagnostic criteria verified by neurologists to be included. While conducted in a real-world clinical setting, the single-center nature and diagnostic verification make the setting somewhat more explanatory than usual care.

The mindfulness-based intervention involved specialized training and organization of care, including intake interviews, 8 weekly 2.5-hour classes, a full-day session, and extensive homework. This represents a substantial change from usual care organization and required additional expertise and resources to deliver the intervention.

Eligibility:
Relevant quotes:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The hypothesis is that the H-CAD system is at least as effective as the usual care for arm/hand function, measured with outcome measures for arm/hand function, given to the stroke, TBI and MS patients when they are living at home.&quot;</span>
2. <span title='Moderate quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 94.8%):

However the use of H-CAD, patients are able to train much more intense compared to in hospital settings which could have additional positive effects.&quot;</span>

The trial aimed to include stroke, TBI and MS patients living at home who would normally receive the H-CAD system intervention. This represents a pragmatic approach, as the eligibility criteria match the type of patients who would receive the intervention in usual care. However, recruiting mainly chronic phase patients who can adhere to the intensive training could slightly limit eligibility compared to usual care.

Recruitment:
Relevant quotes:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Patients were recruited from Unità Organica di Riabilitazione Intensiva Neuromotoria (UORIN, Italy), Foundation Institute Guttmann (FPING, Spain) and from National Multiple Sclerosis Centre (NMSC, Belgium).&quot;</span>

Patients were recruited from multiple rehabilitation centers in different countries. While this allows for some diversity, recruiting only from specialized rehabilitation centers may differ somewhat from usual care, where patients could also be recruited from other settings like primary care or the community.
Score: [3]

Setting:
Relevant quotes:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The primary objective of the project was to validate the EU market – more specifically in Italy, Spain, The Netherlands and Belgium – for a home-care service.&quot;</span>
2. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Main aim of the service is to extend the rehabilitation treatment at patient's home under close supervision of the hospital.&quot;</span>

The trial was conducted across multiple European countries with the aim of validating a home-based tele-rehabilitation service. While this multinational setting enhances pragmatism, the trial appears to be restricted to specialized rehabilitation centers rather than the full spectrum of usual care settings for these conditions.
Score: [3]

Organization:
Relevant quotes:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The tele-rehabilitation service is mainly addressed to neurological patients affected by traumatic brain injury (TBI), stroke or multiple sclerosis (MS).&quot;</span>

The trial utilized the existing H-CAD tele-rehabilitation service without noting any major organizational changes or additional resources compared to usual care. Therapists did not appear to require extra training. This suggests the organization of the intervention matched closely with how it would be delivered in usual care.

Flexibility (delivery):
Relevant quotes:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The actual intervention with the H-CAD system at home consisted of one month, whereby the patients had an average of 30 minutes for at least 5 days a week.&quot;</span>

The exercise compliance during treatment varied; the average days exercising with the system was 24 days (SD = 9, range 7-39 days).&quot;</span>

While a recommended exercise dose and schedule was provided (30 min, 5x/week), the actual delivery allowed flexibility, with patients exercising for 7-39 days over the month. Therapists appear to have been the same as in usual care. However, no information is given on flexibility regarding co-interventions or management of complications.
Score: [3]

Flexibility (adherence):
No relevant quotes. The study does not describe any special measures to enforce patient adherence to the H-CAD system beyond what would occur in usual care.
Score: [NA] 

Follow-up:
Relevant quotes:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The treatment time of the H-CAD was thus slightly higher – but not significantly different – compared to usual care.&quot;</span>
2. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;For this multiple testing: 1) the month of usual care before the intervention (T0-T1) was compared to the month of using the H-CAD system (T1-T2); 2) the month of usual care after the intervention (T2-T3) was compared to the intervention month (T1-T2).&quot;</span>

Follow-up assessments occurred monthly, with the H-CAD month compared to the usual care month immediately before and after. This schedule does not seem markedly more intense than typical follow-up for chronic neurological conditions. No major differences in follow-up methods between trial and usual care are noted.
Score: [4]

Primary outcome:
Relevant quotes: 
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The primary outcome measures at T0 (baseline), T1, T2 and T3 are reported in Table 2 for all three diagnoses groups and presented separately for the control and intervention group. In general, the ARA test showed constant slight improvement in the usual care as well as in the intervention group.&quot;</span>
2. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The outcome measures used in the present study are in line with the international classification of functioning, disability, and health (ICF) model. The outcome measures on functioning level were: the Action Research Arm Test (ARA), Wolf Motor Function Test (WMFT), the Barthel index (BI) and the Abilhand questionnaire.&quot;</span>

The primary outcome measures (ARA test, WMFT, etc.) assessed arm/hand function, which is directly relevant to patients with stroke, TBI and MS. These measures appear to be commonly used in neurological rehabilitation practice. Outcomes were evaluated at baseline and monthly intervals, a typical timeframe for these conditions.
Score: [5]

Primary analysis:
Relevant quote:
1. <span title='Moderate quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 91.9%):

The primary analysis looked at percentage improvement in execution time compared to baseline. It appears to have included all participants, consistent with an intent-to-treat approach, although this is not explicitly stated. No mention is made of excluding data from non-adherent participants or centers.

The trial had fairly broad inclusion criteria of MS patients with various palliative care needs. However, patients had to live in a specific area (South East London) and were screened by a consultant not involved in the intervention, which adds some explanatory elements. The eligibility criteria are a mix of pragmatic and explanatory features.

The fast-track group received palliative care from existing services like district/practice nurses and MS specialists, indicating the intervention leveraged usual care resources. However, the additional informal caregiver support in the fast-track group goes beyond usual care organization.

Score: [4]  

Flexibility (delivery):

Relevant quotes:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The PCT undertook assessments, suggested ways to improve problems, provided specialist welfare benefits advice and bereavement support, and liaised with and acted as a catalyst for local services, both primary and specialist teams.&quot;</span>
2. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;After initial assessment, treatment was recommended.18-20 Care was provided in a similar way to palliative care consultation services described elsewhere,9,11 although the PCT worked in both hospital and the community, and so could visit patients wherever they were.&quot;</span>

The PCT had flexibility in assessing patients and providing tailored recommendations and support, similar to real-world palliative care services. However, the PCT worked in both hospital and community settings, which may differ from usual delivery. Overall, delivery flexibility was high but with some explanatory elements.

Score: [4]

Flexibility (adherence):

This domain is not applicable, as the trial evaluated a palliative care service provided to patients, rather than an intervention requiring patient adherence.

Eligibility:

Relevant quotes:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Eligibility criteria for patients: diagnosis RRMS since at least one year, EDSS score ≤4.0, no symptoms suggestive of a relapse, no relapse in the preceding four weeks, willing and capable of participating in the investigations, and having access to the internet for performing the web-based assessments.&quot;</span>
2. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Eligibility criteria for support partners: willing and capable of participating in the investigations, and having access to the internet.&quot;</span>

The eligibility criteria are somewhat restrictive, excluding patients with higher disability levels (EDSS > 4.0), recent relapses, or lack of internet access. Support partners also need to be willing and have internet access. However, the criteria do not seem to deviate drastically from the typical MS patient population that would be treated with this intervention in usual care. The focus on low-disability RRMS patients capable of using web-based assessments makes the eligibility criteria lean more towards the explanatory end of the spectrum.

Score: [3]

Recruitment:

Relevant quotes:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants were recruited from all over the Netherlands by the patient organisation NMSF, Rotterdam, the Netherlands. Interested patients were contacted by a registered nurse experienced in MS (MH) by phone to check diagnosis and eligibility criteria.&quot;</span>

The trial recruited participants from all over the Netherlands through the patient organization NMSF. This broad geographic recruitment strategy is pragmatic. However, the fact that a registered MS nurse had to contact each patient by phone to verify eligibility and diagnosis makes the recruitment process more intensive than what would typically occur in usual care. There is no mention of recruitment taking place during routine clinical encounters.

Score: [3]

Setting:

Relevant quotes:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;We did a single-centre, randomized (1:1), unmasked, parallel-group, controlled trial in the Netherlands.&quot;</span>

The trial was conducted at a single center in the Netherlands. While this could match the setting of usual care if the intervention is intended to be delivered in a similar single-center context, in most cases a multi-center trial would provide a more pragmatic representation of the range of usual care settings in which the intervention would be implemented. Without more details, it seems this was likely a specialized MS research center rather than a typical community care setting.

Organization:

Relevant quotes:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The multidisciplinary team included a psychiatrist, psychiatric nurse, neurologist, registered nurse specialized in MS, physiotherapist, dance therapist, and a person with MS [9]. All professional team members were formally trained in their respective disciplines and all members were experienced in the field of MS. The person with MS had experience with chronic symptoms and multiple disease-modifying treatments.&quot;</span>
2. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The members respected and understood the participants' individual qualities and differences, and they stimulated, defied and confronted them to explore and push their boundaries [9].&quot;</span>

The trial required a multidisciplinary team of specialists experienced in MS care to deliver the intervention. This included a psychiatrist, MS-specialized nurses, physiotherapist, dance therapist, and even a person with MS to share their experience. The team members received specific training in the social cognitive theory-based approach used in the intervention. This level of specialized expertise and training goes beyond what would typically be available in usual care to deliver this kind of intervention. The delivery relied on resources and provider expertise that are not routinely available.

CDT focuses on the exploration of those stressors that confine patients to their physical, psychological or social roles regarding their disease and limitations; reduces relevant stressors; explores and pushes personal boundaries; and creates new personal boundaries by making optimal use of the existing potential [9].' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;CDT focuses on the exploration of those stressors that confine patients to their physical, psychological or social roles regarding their disease and limitations; reduces these stressors; explores and pushes personal boundaries; and creates new personal boundaries by making optimal use of the existing potential [9].&quot;</span>

The delivery of the intervention appears to be guided by overarching themes and principles of the social cognitive theory-based approach, but the full text does not provide details on how strictly protocolized or monitored the delivery was. The descriptions suggest some flexibility for the multidisciplinary team to tailor the program to focus on each individual patient's specific stressors and goals. However, without more information on the degree of flexibility permitted, it is difficult to determine if the delivery flexibility matches what would be seen in usual care.

Score: [3]

The <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;optional joint activity&quot;</span> suggests that participants had some flexibility in choosing whether to take part in certain intervention components. However, the lack of detail in the full text makes it difficult to assess how much adherence was enforced compared to usual care.

Follow-up:

Relevant quotes:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The enrolment started February 2013 and ended April 2016.

2. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Assessments were at baseline and at one, three and six months follow-up via online questionnaires (www.ms4ri.nl).&quot;</span>

The trial involved follow-up assessments at 1, 3, and 6 months after the intervention, which is more frequent than typical MS care. All follow-up assessments were completed via online questionnaires, which is likely not done routinely in usual care. The follow-up procedures appear to be more intensive than usual care, but are not drastically different as the assessments did not require in-person visits.

Primary outcome:

Relevant quote:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The primary study outcome was the change in control self-efficacy, assessed by the Multiple Sclerosis Self-Efficacy Scale (MSSES), at six months [12]. The MSSES is a specific and sensitive self-report questionnaire consisting of two 9-items subscales for control and functional self-efficacy, with a high internal consistency and test-retest reliability [12].&quot;</span>

The primary outcome was a patient-reported measure of self-efficacy using the Multiple Sclerosis Self-Efficacy Scale (MSSES). This appears to be a relevant outcome from the patient perspective, providing insight into their perceived level of control and functional ability. As a self-report questionnaire, it does not require specialized training or assessment not found in typical care. However, the MSSES seems to be a research tool and it is unclear if it is used regularly in routine MS care.

Primary analysis:

Relevant quotes: 
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;All endpoints were analyzed according to the intention-to-treat principle using an ANCOVA with the 6-month value as dependent variable, and condition, baseline value, disease duration and gender as independent variables.&quot;</span>
2. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Post hoc analyses included ANCOVA with the 1-month and 3-month values as dependent variables, and condition, baseline values, disease duration and gender as independent variables; multiple regression analysis to detect the contribution of age, gender, disease duration, EDSS score and education at six months.&quot;</span>

The primary analysis was conducted using an intention-to-treat approach, including all participants according to their randomized group. This matches the pragmatic approach of including all participants regardless of adherence. Some secondary analyses looked at associations with baseline characteristics like age, gender, disease duration - but these were exploratory and did not involve excluding participants. No methods to account for non-adherence or missing data are mentioned.

Eligibility criteria:
Relevant quotes:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Inclusion criteria were: 1) having a definite diagnosis of MS from a neurologist; 2) being within 5 years of receiving a diagnosis of MS; 3) scoring at least 10 on the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) [26]; 4) not currently undertaking other psychological treatment for depressive or anxiety symptoms for the length of participation in the current trial; 5) speak English fluently; 6) no current or lifetime diagnosis of psychosis; 7) no current substance dependency; 8) no gross cognitive impairment; and 9) no changes to medications prior and during involvement in the trial.&quot;</span>

The eligibility criteria are somewhat restrictive, excluding those with psychosis, substance dependence, cognitive impairment, and those undergoing other psychological treatment. It also requires a minimum depression score. However, the time since diagnosis (within 5 years) is not overly restrictive. Overall, the criteria strike a balance between explanatory and pragmatic.

Eligibility:

Relevant quotes:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Thirty-two participants with multiple sclerosis randomized into intervention or control groups.&quot;</span>
2. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Potential participants were excluded if they had experienced exacerbation of their multiple sclerosis symptoms three months prior to the study, or had any medical condition which may preclude them from taking part in the exercise intervention.&quot;</span>

The trial had relatively broad eligibility criteria, including participants with multiple sclerosis. However, some exclusion criteria were applied that would not be present in usual care, such as excluding those with recent exacerbation of symptoms or medical conditions precluding exercise. This makes the eligibility criteria somewhat more restrictive than a very pragmatic approach.
Score: [3]

Recruitment:

Relevant quotes:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Of the 873 patients on the clinical register for multiple sclerosis 159 patients were deemed suitable for the study. These people were sent invitation letters and participant information sheets.&quot;</span>
2. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Forty-three potential participants expressed an interest in participating.&quot;</span>

Recruitment was done by sending invitation letters to potentially eligible participants identified from a clinical register. This goes beyond recruitment through usual care appointments. However, it leverages an existing patient register, which is more pragmatic than other more explanatory approaches like advertising. Overall, the recruitment approach leans more pragmatic than explanatory.
Score: [4]

Setting:

Relevant quotes:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Setting: Two community leisure centres.&quot;</span>

The intervention was delivered in two community leisure centres. This setting is likely similar to where such an exercise intervention would be delivered in usual care. Conducting the trial in more than one centre also increases the applicability.
Score: [5]

Organization:

Relevant quotes:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The intervention group received 12 weeks of twice weekly, 60-minute group exercise sessions, including mobility, balance and resistance exercises.&quot;</span>
2. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The intervention took place at two different geographical locations (Site A and Site B).&quot;</span>

The intervention involved 12 weeks of hour-long group exercise sessions delivered at two community sites. While some organization was required to deliver these sessions, it does not require resources that go far beyond what would be available in usual care. The setting and format seem reasonably close to how this intervention could be implemented in practice.
Score: [4]

Flexibility (delivery):

Relevant quotes:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Each group was led by two instructors (one physiotherapist and one fitness instructor). The same physiotherapist was present at both sites; however fitness instructors were different between sites.&quot;</span>
2. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants worked at a self-regulated pace for each exercise. Participants were provided with exercise progress cards and were asked to record which level they performed each exercise at each session.&quot;</span>

The intervention allowed participants to work at their own pace and self-regulate their exercise level. Having different fitness instructors between sites also suggests some flexibility in delivery. However, the sessions were still structured and led by instructors following a protocol. This represents a balance between explanatory and pragmatic approaches.
Score: [3]

Flexibility (adherence):

Relevant quote:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Attendance of participants at each class was recorded.&quot;</span>

Participant attendance at the exercise classes was recorded, but there is no indication of measures to enforce or improve adherence. No participants were excluded based on adherence. This suggests a pragmatic approach that allows for flexibility in participants' adherence, similar to what would occur in usual care.
Score: [5]

Follow-up:

Relevant quotes:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Outcome measures were carried out within the local hospital's rehabilitation unit. They were taken at baseline, after 8 and 12 weeks of the intervention period (i.e. either the exercise class or usual care).&quot;</span>
2. <span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 99.7%):

The Timed 25-Foot Walk Test 35 was chosen as the primary outcome measure.

The Timed 25-Foot Walk Test measures walking speed over a short distance and has shown good reliability and validity in the multiple sclerosis population as an individual component of the Multiple Sclerosis Functional Composite disability assessment.&quot;</span>

Outcome assessments were conducted at the hospital rehabilitation unit at baseline, 8 weeks and 12 weeks. This schedule is more frequent than typical follow-up in usual care for this population. The primary outcome measure, while relevant, also requires specific testing outside of usual care. This represents a more explanatory approach to follow-up.
Score: [2]

Primary outcome:

The Timed 25-Foot Walk Test measures walking speed over a short distance and has shown good reliability and validity in the multiple sclerosis population as an individual component of the Multiple Sclerosis Functional Composite disability assessment.&quot;</span>

The primary outcome of walking speed measured by the Timed 25-Foot Walk Test is relevant to patients with multiple sclerosis. However, this specific test is unlikely to be routinely used to assess outcomes in usual care. It was chosen as an individual component of a larger disability assessment scale. Therefore, the primary outcome leans more towards the explanatory end of the spectrum.
Score: [2]

Primary analysis:

The full text does not provide details on the primary analysis method or approach to handling missing data. There is insufficient information to assess whether the analysis was conducted in a more pragmatic or explanatory manner.

<pre>
Here is my assessment of the PRECIS-2 scores for each domain based on the provided full text:

Eligibility:

Relevant quotes:
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Specific inclusion criteria were (1) ambulatory (can walk 100 m, be capable of walking 100 metres without a walking aid corresponding to a classification of ⩽5.5 on the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS),10 even if they do use an aid for daily activities; and (2) self-reported to be sedentary or irregularly active at time of study entry (i.e. do not exercise 30 minutes or more twice per week of moderate to vigorous activity).&quot;</span>
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Excluded were people who were (1) unable to speak and read English or French; (2) unable to respond to simple questions on orientation and memory; (3) have an additional illness that restricts their function; and/or (4) experienced a relapse during the past 30 days as this may affect physical activity/exercise participation.&quot;</span>

The trial had fairly specific eligibility criteria, excluding those unable to walk 100m, those not sedentary/irregularly active, non-English/French speakers, those with orientation/memory issues or illness restricting function, and recent relapse. This is more restrictive than a very pragmatic trial but not as narrow as a very explanatory trial.

Score: [3]

Recruitment:

Relevant quotes:
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The target population was community dwelling individuals aged 19 to 65 who have been diagnosed after 1994 with multiple sclerosis.&quot;</span>
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;People were recruited from four multiple sclerosis clinics in three Canadian cities and from posting on media sites.&quot;</span>

Participants were recruited from both MS clinics and media sites/postings. Using only MS clinics would be more pragmatic, while the media postings make the recruitment approach somewhat less pragmatic.

Score: [4] 

Setting:

Relevant quote:
<span title='Moderate quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 92.6%):

were identified multiple sclerosis clinics in Montreal, Toronto, Winnipeg.' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ff9e81'>&quot;People were identified multiple sclerosis clinics in Montreal, Toronto, Winnipeg.&quot;</span>

The trial was conducted in 3 cities in Canada. While not as pragmatic as a large number of diverse sites, using 3 cities across the country is still reasonably pragmatic and matches the intended setting of the intervention.

Score: [4]

Organization:

Relevant quotes: 
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;For the MSTEP© group, the sessions were used to assess individual needs and design an individualized programme. For the Guideline group, the sessions were used to instruct on the guidelines and learn how to apply principles of safe and effective exercise. All were provided with a portfolio of exercise instructions.&quot;</span>
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;All participants were contacted every two weeks during the first two months, then monthly thereafter by the exercise instructor by telephone or email for follow-up by the instructor. The purpose of follow-up contacts is to provide an opportunity to ask any questions they have and also to facilitate long-term retention in the study.&quot;</span>

The MSTEP group received an individualized exercise program designed in sessions with a therapist. The Guideline group received only instruction on applying exercise guidelines. Both groups had regular follow-up contacts. This represents a modest increase in resources and expertise compared to usual care.

Score: [3]

Flexibility (delivery):

Relevant quotes:
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Two different types of exercise interventions were contrasted. MSTEP©, a personally adapted exercise regimen including a variety of exercises targeting endurance, muscular, and core strength, balance, flexibility, muscular power, and speed of movement.&quot;</span>
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;All were provided with a portfolio of exercise instructions. All participants were contacted every two weeks during the first two months, then monthly thereafter by the exercise instructor by telephone or email for follow-up by the instructor. The purpose of follow-up contacts is to provide an opportunity to ask any questions they have and also to facilitate long-term retention in the study.&quot;</span>

The MSTEP intervention allowed some personalization of the exercise program. However, both groups received a portfolio of instructions and had regular follow-up contacts on a fixed schedule to encourage adherence and retention. This represents an intermediate level of flexibility in delivery.

Score: [3]

Flexibility (adherence):

Relevant quotes:
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The purpose of follow-up contacts is to provide an opportunity to ask any questions they have and also to facilitate long-term retention in the study.&quot;</span>
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;As there were four visits during the first year with four opportunities for missing data, the first set of analyses addressed whether the pattern of missing data was associated with the outcomes measured in this study.&quot;</span>

The regular follow-up contacts were intended in part to facilitate retention. However, it does not appear there were any measures to exclude participants based on adherence. The analysis considered patterns of missing data rather than excluding those with poor adherence.

Score: [4]

Follow-up:

Relevant quotes:
<span title='Major quote deviation, possible hallucination. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 73.8%):

The intention was to follow participants for the first year of the intervention when the exercise programme was designed and adjusted as needed' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: red'>&quot;The intention was to follow participants for the first year of the intervention when the exercise programme was designed and adjusted as needed and have a further follow-up after the second year.&quot;</span>
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;As there were substantial losses to follow-up, only results after one year are presented.&quot;</span>

The plan was to follow participants for 2 years, with the primary analysis at 1 year. This is longer than typical follow-up in usual care for an exercise intervention. However, high loss to follow-up meant only 1-year data could be analyzed.

Score: [3] 

Primary outcome:

Relevant quotes:
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Main measures: Primary outcome was peak oxygen consumption (VO2peak) at 12 months; secondary outcomes were composite measures of physical function, fatigue, and health-related quality of life.&quot;</span>
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Full details on the measures are presented in the protocol publication.9 The primary outcome was exercise capacity as measured by peak oxygen consumption (VO2peak) using a modified Bruce protocol on the cycle ergometer.&quot;</span>

The primary outcome of VO2peak, while clinically relevant, requires a specialized exercise test not typically done in usual care. Secondary outcomes of physical function, fatigue and quality of life are more pragmatic.

Score: [3]

Primary analysis:

Relevant quotes:
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;As the outcomes were continuous, linear regression was used with study status (missing baseline, drop-out before end, or completer) as the explanatory variable, with baseline only serving as the reference category.&quot;</span>
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Multiple imputation was used for missing data with 11 imputations used in the analysis. The primary analysis was of the proportion of people making an absolute improvement at the final time point, 12 months.&quot;</span>

The primary analysis used multiple imputation to handle missing data and analyzed all participants. This is a pragmatic approach in line with intention-to-treat principles. No participants appear to have been excluded based on adherence or protocol deviations.

Score: [5]

In summary, this trial took a mixed approach, with some pragmatic elements like broad recruitment, clinically relevant setting, intention-to-treat analysis; and some more explanatory elements like providing extra resources/expertise, less flexibility in delivery, and a primary outcome requiring specialized testing. Most domains were scored in the middle range between very explanatory and very pragmatic.</pre>

The intervention was delivered by a domiciliary physiotherapist in subjects' homes, but involved task-specific exercises using some equipment (therabands, pedals, weights) that may exceed what is normally available in usual care. The control group received no intervention. Overall the organization is somewhat explanatory.

The intervention followed a defined schedule of 60 minute sessions twice weekly for 8 weeks, but the specific content of the physiotherapy program was tailored to each subject's previously identified goals. This represents a balance between a structured program and flexibility to individualize it.

To improve the reliability of the data, all assessments were undertaken at the Douglas Grant Rehabilitation Centre, Irvine, and the assessor remained blind to the subjects' treatment group allocation.&quot;</span>

Subjects had assessments at baseline, 8 weeks (end of intervention), and 16 weeks. This exceeds the typical follow-up that would occur in usual care. The assessments were also performed at a rehabilitation center by a blinded assessor, rather than in the community, which is explanatory.

The primary outcome was the Multiple Sclerosis Impact Scale (MSIS-29), which is a patient-reported measure of the physical and psychological impact of MS. This is a relevant outcome to patients. However, the MSIS-29 is a multidimensional scale and not routinely used in usual MS care, making it somewhat explanatory.

Outcome variables that could be shown to be analysed using parametric procedures (e.g. FIM), were analysed using a two-factor repeated measures ANOVA with two factors being time (0, 8 and 16) and group (1,2), thus allowing for possible interaction effects to assess whether groups react differently over time.&quot;</span>

The primary analysis was a repeated measures ANOVA comparing the two groups at the three timepoints. This appears to be an intention-to-treat analysis using all available data, which is a pragmatic approach. There is no mention of excluding participants based on adherence or protocol deviations.

The trial had very broad eligibility criteria, essentially including anyone with a confirmed MS diagnosis living in the recruitment area. There were no additional exclusion criteria based on factors like comorbidities, disease severity, treatment response, or ability to adhere. This is a very pragmatic approach that mirrors how the intervention would be applied in usual care.

Participants were recruited through community-based MS voluntary organizations in the area where the intervention was intended to be applied. Recruitment occurred through these existing usual care channels, without extra effort like targeted mailings or advertising. However, participants did have to actively opt-in by returning consent forms, rather than being passively recruited through routine appointments. This represents a slightly more explanatory approach than the most pragmatic extreme.

The trial was conducted in the community setting where the intervention was intended to be applied, which is a pragmatic design choice. However, the assessments took place at a single university research center rather than at the participants' usual care locations. This introduces an aspect of artificiality to the setting compared to usual care.

The organizational resources required to deliver the intervention included trained health professionals and an information booklet. The sessions were flexibly organized based on individual needs, either one-on-one or in groups, and took place either at home or local therapy centers. This largely pragmatic approach worked within existing resources, although the information booklet and flexibility of session format may have represented an enhancement compared to usual care.

As findings from the Delphi study highlighted the need for flexibility and responsiveness to individuals the format of the discussion focused on individuals' interests and concerns rather than on covering all the information contained in the booklet.&quot;</span>

The intervention followed a discussion format guided by an information booklet, but the topics covered were flexibly based on each individual's interests and concerns. There does not appear to have been a strict protocol for delivering the intervention. Tailoring the discussion to individual priorities is reasonably pragmatic, although use of the booklet itself is a departure from usual care.
Score: [4]

Flexibility (adherence):
Quotes: The full text does not contain any mention of measures to monitor or enforce participant adherence to the self-care intervention.

Since no information is given about strategies to monitor or promote participant adherence, and there is no mention of excluding non-adherent participants, this domain cannot be scored due to lack of information.

Participants were assessed at baseline and again after 6 months. The 6-month follow-up is likely somewhat more frequent than the usual care these participants would receive. Additionally, the follow-up assessments collected more extensive health status data (SF-36, SDDR) than would typically be available in usual MS care. However, no unscheduled follow-ups were triggered by health events.

Primary outcome:
Quotes:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;A range of physical and psychological scales was included in order to obtain a comprehensive evaluation of the intervention. Total scores on a postal version of the Barthel Index, a scale measuring mobility, the United Kingdom version of the SF-36 and one measure developed for the study; the Standard Day Dependency Record (SDDR), were the main outcome measures.&quot;</span>
2. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The SDDR was developed out of the MRC Standard Day Interview and measures the extent to which people are assisted in activities of daily living.&quot;</span>

The primary outcomes were a mixture of measures evaluating mobility, independence in activities of daily living, and general physical and mental health. While these constructs are relevant to patients, the specific scales used (Barthel Index, SF-36, SDDR) are not routinely used in usual care, and some were developed specifically for the study. Using these non-standard measures is a more explanatory approach.

The primary analysis excluded participants lost to follow-up, those who declined the intervention, and those who withdrew. Only 43% of the intervention group and 57% of the control group were included. This per-protocol analysis is a strongly explanatory approach, as a true pragmatic intention-to-treat analysis would include all randomized participants.

At the end of the inclusion visit (conducted by the evaluating neurologist not participating in the multidisciplinary team), the patient was randomized via a central Web-based randomization system. Treatment was allocated according to a computer-generated randomization list in a 1:1 ratio. Patients were then randomized in two groups depending on the treatment strategy: (i) an integrated multidisciplinary (IMD) group, consisting of an IMD approach at the Pitie´-Salpeˆtrie`re MS clinic, and (ii) a control group, consisting of successive, non-integrated interventions with different specialists and allied health professionals, at different times and sites (Figure 1).

Reasoning: Follow-up in the IMD group involved a multidisciplinary clinic visit within 3 months, which may be more frequent than typical follow-up in usual care. The control group received usual non-integrated care. Overall, the follow-up is moderately pragmatic but the short-term follow-up of the IMD group is likely more than would occur in usual care.

A higher MSIS-29 score corresponds to lower QoL. The questionnaire takes 25 minutes to complete.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: The primary outcome of change in quality of life, as measured by the MS-specific MSIS-29 scale, is highly relevant and meaningful to patients. The MSIS-29 is a validated scale that could be feasibly implemented in usual care, though the 25 minutes required for completion is longer than some QoL measures. Overall, the primary outcome choice is quite pragmatic.

ical analyses For the sample size, calculations were based on a preliminary study 12 including 40 MS patients. In this pilot study a mean improvement of 10 points over six months on the MSIS-29 scale in the IMD group and a mean worsening of six points in the control group was observed. The standard deviation for the change in the MSIS-29 was 14 points.

Reasoning: The primary analysis appears to be a standard hypothesis test comparing the change in MSIS-29 scores between the two randomized groups. While not explicitly stated, this is likely an intention-to-treat analysis including all randomized patients. No mention is made of excluding patients from the analysis. The sample size calculation is based on detecting a between-group difference, not testing the intervention in an <span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;as treated&quot;</span> fashion.

Relevant quotes:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Thirty community dwelling adults moderately affected by MS (Expanded Disability Status Scale 5-6.5).&quot;</span>
2. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Following baseline assessments, described below, participants were allocated to either Group 1 (intervention) who received 12 weeks of individualised web-based exercise or Group 2 (control) who received usual care.&quot;</span>

The trial recruited community-dwelling adults moderately affected by MS with an EDSS of 5-6.5. This represents a fairly specific population that would likely be treated with the intervention in usual care. However, the trial did exclude those with very mild or very severe MS. Overall, the eligibility criteria are moderately pragmatic.

Score: [3]

Recruitment:

Relevant quotes:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Ethical approval was received from the West of Scotland Research Ethics Service (ref: 12/WS/0147) and participants were recruited from the Multiple Sclerosis Service, at the Douglas Grant Rehabilitation Centre, Irvine, Scotland.&quot;</span>

Participants were recruited from a single MS rehabilitation center. While this is a setting where the intervention would be deployed in usual care, recruiting from only a single center reduces the trial's pragmatism. More details on the recruitment process are needed to fully assess this domain.

Score: [3]

Setting:

Relevant quotes:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Setting: Rehabilitation centre and participants' homes.&quot;</span>

The intervention was delivered via a website, allowing participants to engage in the intervention at home. This matches how the intervention would likely be delivered in usual care. However, participants were recruited from a single MS rehabilitation center, which slightly reduces the pragmatism. Overall, the setting is quite pragmatic.

Score: [4]

Organization:

Relevant quotes:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The website, which was used to deliver the intervention, was developed in collaboration with a patient steering group and incorporating recommendations from the MS Society accessibility policy and advice from the Scottish Accessible Information Forum.&quot;</span>
2. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Individualised therapeutic exercise programmes were developed for participants in Group 1, with exercises selected based on their baseline assessment and personal goals.&quot;</span>

The intervention required some additional organizational resources compared to usual care, including the development of a customized website and the creation of individualized exercise programs for each participant by a physiotherapist. However, these additional resources were not substantial. With further development, a web-based physio program could likely be implemented without significant additional organization. The level of organizational resources appears to be moderately pragmatic.

Score: [3]

Flexibility (delivery):

Relevant quotes:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Individualised therapeutic exercise programmes were developed for participants in Group 1, with exercises selected based on their baseline assessment and personal goals. Participants were given unique log-in details to view their own, online personalised exercise programme.&quot;</span>
2. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants were advised to undertake the exercise programme a minimum of twice a week and to complete their online exercise diary which was seen remotely by the physiotherapist.&quot;</span>

The intervention involved personalized exercise programs developed for each participant based on their baseline assessment and goals. Participants logged in to access their program and were advised to exercise at least twice per week and complete an online diary. This represents a moderate degree of flexibility in delivery - programs were customized to each participant, but there was a protocol for the expected frequency of completion. Overall, the delivery flexibility appears moderately pragmatic.

Score: [3]

Flexibility (adherence):

Relevant quotes:
1. <span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 98.2%):

Participants were contacted weekly by the physiotherapist to discuss progress and update their exercise program as needed. This represents a moderately pragmatic approach to adherence, as the physiotherapist aimed to support adherence but it does not appear any participants were excluded based on adherence. More details would be needed to fully assess adherence flexibility.

Score: [3]

Follow-up:

Relevant quotes:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Outcome measures were recorded at baseline and at the end of the intervention period (week 13). The primary outcome measure, the timed 25 foot walk,14 has good reliability and validity in the MS population.&quot;</span>

The trial had two assessments, at baseline and 13 weeks. This follow-up is only slightly more than would be expected in usual care. The pragmatism is reduced somewhat by the in-person assessments to collect outcome measures that may not be done routinely in usual care. However, overall the follow-up is quite pragmatic.

Score: [4]

Primary outcome:

The primary outcome was the timed 25 foot walk, a measure of gait speed. This is a highly pragmatic and clinically relevant outcome that matters to patients. It is also an outcome routinely collected in MS care.

Score: [5]

The trial had fairly pragmatic eligibility criteria, including treatment-naïve Multiple Sclerosis patients with persistent foot drop for over 3 months. However, the participants were screened for eligibility prior to randomization, which is a more explanatory approach compared to simply including anyone who would be a candidate for the intervention in usual care. The specific eligibility screening criteria are not detailed, so it's unclear how selective or pragmatic they were.

Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive an ankle-foot orthosis or functional electrical stimulation device, by selecting the next envelope from 85 randomly ordered prefilled sealed opaque envelopes.&quot;</span>

Participants were recruited and screened for eligibility prior to randomization. The full text does not provide details on the recruitment methods, such as whether recruitment was done through usual clinic visits or if supplementary recruitment efforts were used. The randomization using sealed envelopes suggests the recruitment was implemented specifically for the trial rather than embedded in routine care. However, without more details on the recruitment process, an assessment of how pragmatic or explanatory it was is difficult.

The trial was conducted across seven outpatient MS clinics in Scotland. Assuming these clinics are representative of the typical setting where MS patients would receive treatment for foot drop, this represents a fairly pragmatic choice of setting. Including multiple centers increases the applicability compared to a single center trial. However, details are lacking to fully assess how well the trial clinics match the settings where the results are intended to be applied.

Electrode position, pulse width, waveform and ramping parameters were adjusted for each participant in order to achieve a comfortable and efficient muscle contraction.' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;Participants in both groups were assessed and fitted with an Odstock Dropped Foot Stimulator Pace (OML, Salisbury) device by a physiotherapist experienced in functional electrical stimulation (A.L.). Wired heel switches and a stimulation frequency of 40 Hz were applied. Electrode position, pulse width, waveform and ramping parameters were adjusted for each participant in order to achieve a comfortable and efficient muscle contraction.&quot;</span>

The trial utilized existing clinic staff (physiotherapists) to fit patients with the devices. However, the physiotherapists had specific experience with functional electrical stimulation, which may exceed what is normally available in routine care. Participants were instructed to gradually increase wear of the devices over six weeks, which is an approach that may not occur in usual care. Overall the delivery seems to rely on some trial-specific organization and resources.

The trial protocol specified some details of how the intervention should be delivered, such as gradually increasing wear over six weeks and adjusting stimulation parameters for patient comfort. However, the stimulation parameters were individualized to each participant, allowing some flexibility. Overall the delivery allowed for a moderate degree of flexibility rather than being highly regimented.

Flexibility (adherence):

Relevant quotes:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants walked at their preferred walking speed around a 9.5 m elliptical course for 5 minutes, resulting in a 10-meter shuttle length.&quot;</span>

The trial did not appear to implement any special measures to enforce or monitor patient adherence. Participants were allowed to walk at their preferred speed during assessments. No mention is made of excluding patients for non-adherence. This represents a pragmatic approach that is likely similar to how adherence would be managed in usual care.

1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Outcome measures were administered by two unblinded assessors (Rebecca Hunter and A.L.) at baseline (0), 3, 6 and 12 months, except for the Psychological Impact of Assistive Devices Score15 which was administered at 12 months only.&quot;</span>

Follow-up assessments were conducted at baseline, 3, 6 and 12 months, with one outcome measure only assessed at 12 months. This schedule involves more frequent follow-up than would likely occur under usual care. The assessments were administered by trial personnel. Overall this represents a more explanatory approach to follow-up than the highly pragmatic approach of solely using routine data collection.

Primary outcome:

Relevant quotes:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The primary outcome was walking speed as measured by the 5-minute self-selected walk test.&quot;</span>

The primary outcome of walking speed, measured by a 5-minute self-selected walk test, appears to be a pragmatic and directly relevant outcome from the patient perspective. It is an outcome that matters to patients and would likely be used to assess mobility in regular practice. No central adjudication or non-standard assessment appears to have been used. The 5-minute walk test seems to be a reasonably pragmatic approach, though it's unclear if it fully replicates walking assessment under usual care conditions.

Score: [4]

Primary analysis:

Relevant quotes:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;A Restricted Maximum Likelihood approach to fitting mixed models was employed to allow intention to treat assumptions to cope with missing data. All analysis was performed on IBM SPSS v24, using a 5% level of significance (IBM, New York, USA).&quot;</span>

The trial used a restricted maximum likelihood mixed model approach to allow for an intention-to-treat analysis that copes with missing data. This suggests a pragmatic approach of using all available data in the primary analysis, rather than a more explanatory per-protocol or as-treated analysis. The use of mixed models to handle missing data is a reasonable approach that preserves an intention-to-treat framework.

The trial included adults with severe MS and their carers, who were designated by the patient except in cases of severe cognitive impairment. This population seems fairly representative of who would receive the intervention in usual care, though some specifics of the eligibility criteria are not provided. The 2:1 randomization ratio also deviates somewhat from a fully pragmatic approach.

Participants were recruited from three centers in Italy. The inclusion criteria of having severe progressive MS (EDSS ≥8.0) with complex symptoms and unmet needs suggests the trial recruited from the types of patients likely to receive this intervention in usual care. However, some details on the recruitment process are lacking. The non-institutionalized requirement may differ from usual care.

The trial was conducted in three centers in Italy (Milan, Rome, Catania) and delivered a home-based intervention, which is likely representative of the setting in which this type of palliative care would be provided in usual practice. However, it's unclear if these three centers are fully representative of all centers that would deliver this care in Italy.

The intervention was delivered by multi-professional teams at each center, involving physicians, nurses, psychologists and social workers. This staffing appears to be what would be typically available to provide this type of palliative care intervention, rather than utilizing additional specialist staff. The intensity of visits (averaging 2-5 per month) also seems consistent with usual care.

The delivery appears to be flexible and pragmatic - after an initial comprehensive needs assessment, the intervention was tailored to each dyad's needs, involving the dyad, caring physician and emergency services as needed. All activities occurred in the patient's home. There is no mention of rigid protocols or intensive monitoring to ensure adherence to a specific intervention protocol.

Follow-up appears to be only moderately different from usual care. Patients were assessed by the HPA teams within 8-12 days of randomization. Needs were re-assessed at the end of the 6-month intervention based on team reports, but there is no indication of intense follow-up beyond what would be expected for this type of intervention. Some data was collected from team reports rather than directly from patients.

The two primary outcomes of quality of life (SEIQoL-DW) and symptom burden (POS-S-MS) are patient-centered measures that are directly relevant to the participants. The SEIQoL-DW interview asks patients to self-nominate the key areas of their life that determine their quality of life. These outcomes do not appear to be obscure, short-term or surrogate outcomes, but rather pragmatic endpoints that matter to patients.

The primary analysis included 50 out of the 52 randomized dyads. Two dyads were excluded because they did not receive the allocated intervention. This is a modified intention-to-treat approach that is mostly pragmatic, only excluding a small number of patients for not receiving the intervention. There is no mention of adjusting for adherence or other factors. Two-sided p-values <0.05 were considered significant without adjustment for multiple comparisons, which is a pragmatic approach.

The trial had relatively broad inclusion criteria of clinically definite MS, fatigue impacting daily life, and being ambulatory. The main exclusion criteria were having recently taken part in a fatigue program, cognitive impairments, recent relapse, or recent initiation of certain medications. While these criteria are somewhat selective, they are not overly restrictive and appear generally aligned with the types of MS patients who would be candidates for this fatigue intervention in usual care. The trial recruited from both primary and secondary care sources.

The trial recruited participants from multiple geographic areas in the UK through primary care, secondary care, and MS Society newsletters/websites. This approach leverages usual care clinical settings but also includes some additional recruitment efforts through MS Society outreach. However, these additional efforts do not seem excessive and align with how patients with MS experiencing fatigue would likely be engaged in routine care.

The paper does not describe any special measures to enforce or encourage adherence, such as excluding non-adherent participants. Attendance at 4 or more sessions (86%) and the final session (79%) was high but not 100%. This suggests that while adherence was good, it was not unusually enforced compared to what would be expected in routine care.

The trial had two follow-up points, with good retention of 89% at first follow-up and 88% at second follow-up. While this follow-up is more intensive than routine care, it does not seem excessive, especially considering the 1-year study duration. No unscheduled visits triggered by events are described.

The primary outcomes were fatigue severity, MS-specific quality of life, and fatigue self-efficacy. These outcomes, especially fatigue severity and quality of life, are likely to be directly meaningful and relevant to people with MS. The fatigue self-efficacy scale appears to be a measure more specific to the intervention.

Thirty-five patients (N = 28 Females) were recruited and gave their written consent to participate to this study. Inclusion criteria for the study included (1) a diagnosis of MS, (2) not currently engaged in rehabilitation, therapy or PA program and able to undertake PA without risk-factors (3) aged between 18 and 65 (4) able to give informed consent and to understand French.&quot;</span>

The eligibility criteria are somewhat restrictive, excluding those currently in rehabilitation or therapy, those with risk factors for PA, those outside the 18-65 age range, and those unable to provide informed consent or understand French. However, the population is still fairly broad, recruiting from multiple hospitals and including both genders across a wide age range. The criteria do not seem to exclude patients based on strict disease characteristics or require extra screening tests. Overall, the eligibility criteria are moderately pragmatic.

Participants were recruited from only two hospitals in one region of France. While recruiting from multiple sites is more pragmatic than a single site, the recruitment was still fairly narrow and targeted MS patients already receiving outpatient services at these specific locations. There is no indication that recruitment occurred through usual care visits without extra effort. The recruitment approach leans more explanatory than pragmatic.

The trial was conducted in a routine medical setting where MS patients receive care (hospitals with outpatient MS services). This is the same type of setting where the intervention would be applied in practice. However, the trial was limited to only two hospitals in one region of France, so the results may not fully generalize to other settings where the intervention could be used. The setting has both pragmatic and explanatory features.

Practicing sessions took place at home under the supervision of a physical and sports activity trainer specializing in sports training.&quot;</span>

The intervention required some additional resources beyond usual MS care, including content developed by experts at two hospitals, a manualized booklet, and supervision by a specialized trainer. However, the sessions took place at participants' homes, and the intervention does not seem to require extensive additional facilities, equipment or training. The organization of the intervention has both pragmatic and explanatory aspects, but leans somewhat more pragmatic as it does not require major changes to usual care delivery.

The intervention followed a defined, manualized protocol developed by experts. The content and components seem to have been largely fixed, with stretching, muscle building, and coordination/balance activities performed under supervision for a set duration. There is no mention of flexibility in how the intervention could be delivered or adapted. This suggests a more explanatory than pragmatic approach to delivery flexibility.
Score: [2]  

Flexibility (adherence):

Relevant quotes:
No relevant quotes identified. The manuscript does not discuss any strategies to monitor or enforce participant adherence to the intervention.

There is insufficient information provided to determine how pragmatic or explanatory the trial was in regards to flexibility of participant adherence. No details are given about if or how adherence was monitored or encouraged.

The trial had assessments at only two timepoints - baseline and immediately post-intervention at 8 weeks. This schedule does not seem to involve more frequent or intense follow-up than would occur in usual care over this time period. No unscheduled visits were mentioned. However, without more details on what follow-up entails in routine MS care, it is difficult to determine if this 8-week post-intervention follow-up is more than usual. There is insufficient information overall to fully judge how pragmatic or explanatory the follow-up was.

Primary outcome:

Relevant quotes:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy of a PA program compared to two types of psychological interventions – Mindfulness and Implementation Intention – delivered via internet, in reducing consequences of MS. Effects of practicing were unrelated to degree of impairment (i.e., EDSS level).&quot;</span>
2. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;In MBI group, we noted no correlation in T1 and T2 between MFIS (physical component) and the time spent practicing PA (MVPA). Finally, in control group, we found at T2 a statistically significant positive correlation (r = 0.640; Puncorrected = 0.025) between MFIS (physical component) and MVPA, but this correlation did not survive when applying stringent adjustment for multiple comparisons across the correlations.&quot;</span>

The primary outcomes seem to be fatigue (MFIS) and physical activity (MVPA), which are measured using patient-reported questionnaires. These outcomes are relevant to patients and are routinely used in MS care. The outcomes do not rely on surrogates, central adjudication, or specialized measures that would not be available in usual care. Using fatigue and physical activity as primary outcomes is a pragmatic choice.

In contrast, we found at T2 a statistically significant negative correlation (r = −0.745; p = 0.008) between MFIS (physical component) and MVPA.&quot;</span>

The manuscript does not explicitly state the primary analysis population or whether any participants were excluded from analysis. Based on the correlation analyses presented, it appears all participants with data at the relevant timepoints were included. There is no mention of analyses restricted only to adherent participants or per-protocol analyses. Intent-to-treat analysis is not explicitly stated but may have been used. Without more details on handling of missing data and participant flow, there is insufficient information to determine how pragmatic or explanatory the primary analysis was.

The eligibility criteria are somewhat restrictive, specifying a narrow age range (26-50 years), specific types of MS, and EDSS and EDSSpyr score ranges. This differs from a very pragmatic approach that would include anyone with MS who would be a candidate for the intervention in usual care. However, the criteria are not extremely narrow either, still encompassing a moderately broad sample of MS patients.

Participants were assessed at the specialized MS center before and after the intervention, by the same neurologist. This represents a follow-up protocol that is more extensive than typical usual care, so is a more explanatory approach. However, with only pre and post assessments and no ongoing follow-up, it is not an extremely explanatory approach either.

The primary outcomes of spasticity, cognitive function, mood and fatigue are relevant and important to MS patients. The methods used to assess them (EDSS, neuropsychological tests, depression and fatigue scales) are commonly used in MS care and research, though perhaps not routinely assessed in usual care. This suggests a balance between explanatory and pragmatic approaches.

Eligibility:
Quotes:
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;MS patients older than 18 years who had a confirmed MS with spasticity of the lower limbs and an Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS)9 score between 4 and 6.5 were eligible for inclusion. Patients who had received hippotherapy within the last 12 months, a body weight over 90 kg, no balance while sitting, and acute exacerbation during the 4-week period before start of the therapy were excluded.&quot;</span>
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;A planned start of treatment with new antispastic drugs or other medications that may have an influence on the assessed outcomes also resulted in exclusion.&quot;</span>

The eligibility criteria are somewhat restrictive, excluding patients over 90kg, with poor sitting balance, recent hippotherapy, planned medication changes, or acute exacerbation. However, the key criteria of confirmed MS, lower limb spasticity, and EDSS 4-6.5 are not overly narrow. The criteria strike a balance between the explanatory and pragmatic.
Score: [3]

Recruitment:
Quotes: No relevant quotes identified. The full text does not provide details on the recruitment process.

There is insufficient information provided about the recruitment procedures to assess how pragmatic or explanatory they were. 
Score: [NA]

Setting:
Quotes: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;MS-HIPPO was a prospective, randomized, examiner-blinded, multicenter, comparative trial with an allocation of 1:1 to the two groups: hippotherapy plus standard care compared to standard care alone (as prior to the study). The intervention lasted for 12 weeks.&quot;</span>
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The study was conducted at five sites in Germany, all of which have hippotherapy experience as stipulated by the rules of the German Consortium for Therapeutic Riding.&quot;</span>

The trial was conducted at 5 sites in Germany that had experience with hippotherapy. While this represents multiple centers, they were all specialized in providing the intervention. A fully pragmatic approach would include a wider range of typical clinical settings. 
Score: [3]

Organization:
Quotes: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The study was approved by the respective ethical committees of the participating sites and registered with the German Trial Registry (DRKS00005289).&quot;</span>

The study required ethical approvals from multiple committees, which goes beyond what would be needed to deliver the intervention in usual care. However, no other organizational differences from usual care are noted.

The delivery of hippotherapy is described in general terms, suggesting flexibility for the therapists to tailor it to each patient. No strict protocol is mentioned. However, some key goals and components are specified.
Score: [4]

Flexibility (adherence):
Quotes: No relevant quotes identified. The full text does not discuss any measures to monitor or enforce patient engagement with the intervention.

There is no indication of procedures to monitor or improve patient adherence, which implies flexibility for the patients to engage with hippotherapy as they would in usual care.

Follow-up:
Quotes: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Examinations and questionnaires were completed prior to the first hippotherapy session (baseline), after 6–7 weeks (interim assessment) and after 12 weeks (final assessment). Physiotherapists who assessed the endpoints in a separate room were blinded and explicitly trained not to question patients or hippotherapists.&quot;</span>
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Patients were individually instructed to keep confidentiality of their allocation group.&quot;</span>

Follow-up assessments were done at 6-7 weeks and 12 weeks, which is more than typical for usual care of MS. Physiotherapists were blinded to allocation. Patients were instructed not to reveal their group. These procedures are more explanatory than pragmatic.

The primary analysis was a modified intention-to-treat, including all randomized patients with a baseline assessment. Missing data were imputed using last observation carried forward. A supplementary mixed-model repeated measures analysis was also done. While not as pragmatic as a full ITT using all randomized patients, the mITT approach is more pragmatic than a per-protocol or as-treated analysis.

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants whose clinical features appeared incompatible with the recorded diagnosis were excluded.&quot;</span>

The trial included a fairly broad population of adults over 15 with progressive neurological conditions. A few exclusions were made based on incompatibility of clinical features with the diagnosis, which would likely also be done in usual care. However, the inclusion was not as broad as it could be, as it focused on specific diagnoses rather than all progressive neurological conditions.

Recruitment was done by approaching GPs within a defined city area and having them identify eligible patients from their records based on diagnosis. This is a fairly pragmatic approach, as it uses existing healthcare providers and records. However, it required active outreach to GPs rather than relying on usual care pathways alone.

The trial had fairly strict eligibility criteria, including requiring a confirmed diagnosis of relapsing MS, being on natalizumab for at least 24 months, having an EDSS score ≤7.0, and not having active disease at baseline. These criteria are more restrictive than the typical MS population that would receive natalizumab in usual care. However, some criteria like the diagnosis of relapsing MS and use of natalizumab are still in line with the trial's target population.

The trial protocol specified the timing and type of DMTs permitted after natalizumab discontinuation. This is a more rigid, less flexible approach than would be likely in usual care, where the choice and timing of switching to another DMT would be left up to the clinician's discretion based on the individual patient's situation.
Score: [2]

Flexibility (adherence):
The full text does not mention any measures to monitor or enforce patient adherence to the assigned intervention protocol. Adherence does not appear to be a major issue though, since the interventions mainly involved the timing of DMT administration by clinicians.

The study does not explicitly state that an intention-to-treat analysis was used. However, no mention is made of excluding any randomized participants from the analysis, so it appears that all available data was used. More details on handling of missing data would be needed to fully assess this domain.

2. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Ethical approval was obtained through the University of Queensland Institutional Human Research Ethics Committee and the Multiple Sclerosis New South Wales Ethics Review Board.&quot;</span>

The trial had several exclusion criteria that differ from usual care, such as excluding those already in an exercise program, those with recent exacerbations or medication changes, and those unwilling to be randomized. Obtaining ethical approval from institutional committees is also not part of usual care. However, the criteria do not seem overly restrictive and are reasonable for conducting a trial safely and ethically in this population.

Inclusion criteria were the following: diagnosis of MS made by a neurologist, able to walk 10 meters with or without an aid within 2 minutes, no relapse of their MS in the past 4 weeks, and no other non-motor symptoms that could affect function in MS simultaneously.&quot;</span>

Participants were recruited through MS societies, which differs somewhat from usual care. The inclusion criteria of diagnosis by a neurologist and ability to walk 10m in 2 minutes without relapse seem reasonable approximations of the MS population likely to receive this intervention in practice. No other major recruitment efforts outside of usual care are mentioned.

Organization:

Relevant quotes:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Groups were led by a physiotherapist employed by the Multiple Sclerosis Society who received training to ensure a standard approach to intervention, intensity, and progression.&quot;</span>

The intervention required a physiotherapist from the MS Society who received additional training to standardize the program. Participants also received an illustrated exercise booklet, which may go beyond what is typically available in usual care. These factors suggest some additional organizational resources were required.

2) <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;A sample size calculation for the definitive RCT was based on a 5% difference in weight loss between intervention and comparator at 12 months (20). Assuming an SD of 19.9%, 80% power, a 0.05 two-sided significance level, and a conservative 25% loss to follow-up estimate, 335 men in each arm (670 total) would be required.&quot;</span>

The eligibility criteria are fairly pragmatic, including a broad age range (35-65) and BMI cutoff (≤28) that would likely capture a significant portion of male hockey fans. The trial also recruited from two different sites. However, the BMI cutoff and focus only on male fans make the eligibility criteria slightly more restrictive than a fully pragmatic trial.

The trial used a variety of recruitment methods including team email lists, social media, a study website, posters, traditional media ads, word of mouth, and direct contact at arenas. While using multiple methods is pragmatic, some of these methods like a study website and media ads go beyond what would typically be used in usual care. The trial also required PAR-Q or physician clearance which is an extra step.

The intervention group had follow-up measurement sessions at 12 weeks and 12 months, while the control group only had a 12 week follow-up. This is more intensive than typical follow-up in usual care. The measurements included BMI, step counts, and fruit/vegetable consumption which also goes beyond routine data collection.

The primary outcome was weight loss at 12 weeks, which is a clinically meaningful outcome of importance to participants. The data were analyzed using intent-to-treat, including those with missing data. This is a fairly pragmatic approach, though a truly pragmatic trial may have extended follow-up beyond 12 weeks.

The trial included pregnant women in labor at a single hospital in Sao Paulo, Brazil who were at least 37 weeks gestation with cervical dilation ≥4cm and having at least 2 contractions per 10 minutes. They were randomized into blocks of 6. This represents a fairly pragmatic approach, as these criteria are typical for women in active labor who would normally receive pain management. However, conducting the trial at a single center makes it somewhat less generalizable.

The trial was conducted at a single university hospital in Sao Paulo, Brazil. While this is a typical setting where pregnant women in labor would receive care, the fact that it was limited to a single center makes the setting more explanatory than pragmatic. Results may not generalize to other hospitals or settings.

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The pregnant women in labor obtained normal obstetrical treatment. Where the study was carried out, the following was permitted: the presence of someone to accompany the pregnant lady, the use of methods other than drugs such as taking a shower, massages in the lower back region and breathing exercises as well as liberty of movement (in cases where this did not go against medical advice).&quot;</span>

The trial required that the acupressure practitioner receive 32 hours of specialized training and use a special device to standardize the pressure applied. This goes beyond what would typically be available in usual care. However, otherwise the women received usual obstetric care during labor, including non-pharmacological pain management techniques, presence of a support person, and freedom of movement when medically appropriate. On balance, the trial used a moderately pragmatic approach in terms of organization.

A child-cushioned electronic anthropometric scale was used to control and to put consistent pressure on the thumps until the researcher could apply such pressure for the SP6 and TG groups.&quot;</span>

The intervention involved applying pressure to the SP6 acupuncture point for a fixed duration of 20 minutes, by a researcher with specialized training using a standardized amount of pressure. This represents an inflexible, protocol-driven approach to delivering the intervention. A more pragmatic design would allow flexibility for the practitioner to adjust the treatment as they saw fit.
Score: [2] 

Flexibility (adherence):
This domain is not applicable, as it relates to patient adherence. Once the women consented to participate, they received the full intervention (acupressure, touch, or usual care) from the practitioner. There was no adherence issue on the part of the participants.

The main follow-up appears to have occurred immediately after the 20-minute acupressure intervention, when pain was assessed using the VAS scale. Table 3 shows VAS scores before treatment, at 20 minutes, and at 60 minutes. No long-term follow-up beyond the labor and delivery period is described. However, assessing pain shortly after the intervention is reasonable for this condition and setting. The approach to follow-up is moderately pragmatic.

The primary outcome was pain during labor, assessed using the Visual Analog Scale (VAS), which is a commonly used and validated measure of pain. This is an outcome that is meaningful to women and providers. The VAS is simple to administer and interpret. Using the VAS as the primary outcome represents a pragmatic approach.

The trial enrolled patients from primary healthcare settings and private lung physicians' offices in the Reykjavik capital area. It seems the eligibility criteria were quite broad, enrolling all potentially relevant patients from these sites until all possible sites had been scanned. This suggests the participants are fairly representative of the patients who would receive the intervention if it was part of usual care. However, the trial was limited to a specific geographic area (Reykjavik capital area) which makes it somewhat less pragmatic.

Patients were recruited by contacting potentially relevant patients from primary healthcare settings and private lung physicians' offices. This approach leverages existing healthcare settings to identify patients, which is quite pragmatic. However, patients were actively contacted for enrollment rather than being recruited through usual appointments, and the recruitment was limited to a specific geographic area, so the approach is not maximally pragmatic.

Setting:

Relevant quote:
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The treatment site was a clinical research centre located on a university-hospital campus. Enrolment ended when patients' registry in all possible clinical sites had been scanned. Data collection lasted from June 2009–March 2013.&quot;</span>

The intervention was delivered at a single clinical research center located on a university-hospital campus. While this is a real-world clinical setting, using a single center makes the trial less pragmatic than if it had been delivered across multiple centers. The pragmatic approach would be to deliver the intervention in the same varied settings where it would be implemented in usual care.

The control group received usual care, suggesting follow-up procedures were not more intense than usual care. Data collection occurred over an extended period from 2009-2013, but it's unclear if this involved more frequent follow-up than usual care. There is not quite enough information to determine if follow-up was different than usual care.

The intervention was provided for 6 months with a subsequent follow-up for additional 6 months.&quot;</span>

The primary outcome appears to be evaluating the effectiveness of the self-management program on COPD patients, which seems like an outcome that would be meaningful to patients. Assessing effectiveness at 6 months with an additional 6 month follow-up also seems like a reasonably pragmatic timeframe. However, without more details on exactly how effectiveness was measured, it's difficult to fully assess if the outcome measures were maximally pragmatic.

The study did not use an intent-to-treat approach, which is the most pragmatic approach to analysis. Instead, it seems only available data was analyzed, without explicitly stating the analysis approach. Lack of intent-to-treat analysis makes the analysis less pragmatic.

1. Eligibility criteria

Relevant quotes:
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Objective To determine whether routine review by telephone of patients with asthma improves access and is a good alternative to face to face reviews in general practices.&quot;</span>
<span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 97.1%):

The trial aimed to determine if telephone consultations were a good alternative to face-to-face reviews for asthma patients in general practices. Patients were randomized to either telephone or face-to-face consultation with an asthma nurse. The eligibility criteria seem to be simply having asthma and being a patient at the participating general practices, which is likely very similar to the patients who would receive this intervention if implemented in usual care. No additional inclusion/exclusion criteria are mentioned that would make the participants different from usual care.

Score: [4]

2. Recruitment

Relevant quotes:
<span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 99%):

Patients were recruited from four general practices that took part in the study. The practices used their computerized records to identify adults prescribed bronchodilator inhalers in a recent time period. This recruitment approach of using electronic records to identify potentially eligible patients is likely very similar to how patients would be identified for asthma review in usual care.

Score: [5] 

3. Setting

Relevant quote:
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Setting Four general practices in England.&quot;</span>

The trial was conducted in four general practices in England. Assuming the intent is for the intervention to be applicable to typical general practices, this is the same setting as where the results would be applied.

Score: [5]

4. Organization

Relevant quotes:
<span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 97.1%):

pants were randomised to either telephone review or face to face consultation with the asthma nurse.' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;Patients were randomised to either telephone review or face to face consultation with the asthma nurse.&quot;</span>
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Nurses arranged any follow up consultations (whether in the surgery or by telephone) they deemed clinically necessary. Patients were free to arrange any consultations they wished.&quot;</span>

The intervention involved having asthma nurses conduct the reviews, either by telephone or face-to-face. Nurses could arrange follow-up consultations as clinically needed, and patients could also arrange additional consultations if desired. This set-up does not require any additional resources or changes in care organization compared to usual care.

Score: [5]

5. Flexibility (delivery)

Relevant quotes:
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Nurses arranged any follow up consultations (whether in the surgery or by telephone) they deemed clinically necessary.&quot;</span>
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Telephone consultations are safe alternatives in the triage of requests for same day appointments.&quot;</span>

The nurses had flexibility in arranging follow-up consultations by telephone or in-person as they felt was clinically needed. The discussion also notes that telephone consultations are considered safe alternatives for triaging same-day appointment requests in usual care. This suggests the intervention delivery had similar flexibility to usual care.

Score: [4]

6. Flexibility (adherence)

There are no relevant quotes about measures to ensure or monitor patient adherence to the intervention protocols. The patients were not required to adhere to any particular behaviors. This domain does not seem applicable for this trial.

Score: [NA] 

7. Follow-up

Relevant quotes:
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Nurses arranged any follow up consultations (whether in the surgery or by telephone) they deemed clinically necessary. Patients were free to arrange any consultations they wished.&quot;</span>
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;A large US trial that compared normal clinic visits with a mix of face to face consultations and telephone reviews (the recommended interval for clinic visits was doubled and three telephone reviews took place in the intervening period) showed that telephone review has the potential to reduce morbidity, use of medication, and use of the health service in patients with a range of chronic disorders.&quot;</span>

Nurses could arrange follow-up consultations as clinically indicated, with patients also free to schedule visits as desired. The discussion mentions another trial that had telephone reviews between in-person visits at double the usual interval. However, there is no indication that the follow-up in this study differed from usual care.

Score: [4]

8. Primary outcome

Relevant quotes:
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Main outcome measures Primary outcome measures were the proportion of participants who were reviewed within three months of randomisation and disease specific quality of life, as measured by the Juniper mini asthma quality of life questionnaire.&quot;</span>

The primary outcomes were 1) the proportion of patients reviewed within 3 months and 2) asthma-related quality of life measured by a standard questionnaire. The first outcome, whether patients actually received their review, is directly relevant to patients and providers. Quality of life is also a patient-centered outcome. The Juniper mini-AQLQ is a validated questionnaire but may not be used in all usual care.

Score: [4]

9. Primary analysis

Relevant quotes:
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Sample size and statistical methods—An 80% power, at the 5% significance level (two tailed test), of detecting a 20% difference in the proportion of patients reviewed&quot;</span>
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;To measure asthma morbidity we used the &quot;</span>short Q,<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot; a validated score incorporating three questions recommended by the Royal College of Physicians as outcome indicators for routine use in asthma care.&quot;</span>

The sample size calculation and statistical analysis are not described in much detail. However, they aimed to detect a 20% difference in proportion of patients reviewed, analyzed the "short Q" morbidity score, and used nursing care satisfaction questionnaires. There is no mention of excluding any participants from analysis for protocol non-adherence. The limited information provided is consistent with an intent-to-treat approach.

The trial had some exclusion criteria that would not be present in usual care, such as inability to complete questionnaires unaided. However, the exclusion criteria were not overly restrictive and a high percentage of patients in both groups attended all clinic visits, suggesting the participants were fairly representative of typical rheumatoid arthritis patients. The eligibility criteria lean more pragmatic than explanatory.

The trial recruited rheumatoid arthritis patients meeting the 1987 ACR criteria who were 18 or older and could complete questionnaires. This matches how patients would be recruited in usual rheumatology care. No additional recruitment efforts beyond usual care are mentioned.
Score: [5]  

Setting:
Quotes:
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;This study required three practitioners at each centre; a CNS, a rheumatologist and a blind independent assessor.&quot;</span>
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Nine CNS and 10 rheumatologists delivered the interventions. The CNS had a median experience of 10 years in their current post while the rheumatologists had a median of 9 years at consultant level.&quot;</span>

The trial was conducted at multiple rheumatology centers by experienced clinical nurse specialists and rheumatologists. This closely matches the usual care setting for treating rheumatoid arthritis patients in the UK.

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;When patients arrived at the clinic, the independent assessor performed 'joint counts' for DAS28 and then oversaw the completion of self-reported pain visual analogue scale (pain-VAS), fatigue-VAS and duration of morning stiffness. The patients were then given questionnaires in 'freepost' return envelopes before consultation with their allocated practitioner.&quot;</span>

The interventions were delivered by the patients' usual rheumatologists and clinical nurse specialists, suggesting flexibility in delivery. However, the trial protocol dictated the timing and types of assessments administered before the consultation.

Patients attended clinic visits that were part of the trial protocol, with high attendance rates in both groups over the 12-month period. This represents a more intensive follow-up schedule than would be typical in usual care.
Score: [2]

Primary outcome:
Quotes:
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The primary outcome was DAS28 and secondary outcomes were pain severity (pain-VAS), fatigue (fatigue-VAS) and duration of morning stiffness measured at each study visit. Other secondary outcome measures were at baseline, weeks 26 and 52: RA quality of life; health assessment questionnaire disability index; hospital anxiety and depression scale; arthritis self-efficacy scale; and Leeds satisfaction questionnaire (LSQ).&quot;</span>

The primary outcome of rheumatoid arthritis disease activity (DAS28) is highly relevant to patients. Secondary outcomes like pain, fatigue, disability, and quality of life are also important to patients. The measures used, such as DAS28 and the Health Assessment Questionnaire, are routinely collected in rheumatology care, though some of the other measures may be less commonly used.

1. Eligibility criteria

Relevant quotes:
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants comprised 50.6% Indigenous Australians and 60.8% had established CVD. At baseline, use of combination treatment was 50.1%.&quot;</span>
<span title='Major quote deviation, possible hallucination. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 55.8%):

Participants were excluded if it was felt clinically inappropriate to alter medications.' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: red'>&quot;Participants were excluded if they had a usual clinic BP of <130/80mmHg and were not taking any BP lowering medications.&quot;</span>

The trial included a broad population of Indigenous Australians and those with established CVD, who would likely be candidates for the polypill intervention in usual care. However, those with BP already controlled without medications were excluded, which is a more explanatory approach. Overall, the eligibility criteria were moderately pragmatic.

Score: [3]

2. Recruitment

Relevant quotes:
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;We conducted a randomized, open-label trial involving 623 participants from Australian general practices.&quot;</span>
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The study failed to recruit the numbers of participants originally planned as a result of limited resources and was therefore under-powered to demonstrate significant differences in BP and cholesterol.&quot;</span>

Participants were recruited from general practices, which is a pragmatic approach. However, recruitment was limited by resources leading to under-enrollment. The full text does not provide further details on specific recruitment methods used.

Score: [4]

3. Setting

Relevant quote:
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;We conducted a randomized, open-label trial involving 623 participants from Australian general practices.&quot;</span>

The trial was conducted in Australian general practices, which is the same setting in which the polypill intervention would be used in usual care. This represents a very pragmatic approach to setting.

Score: [5]

4. Organization

Relevant quotes:
<span title='Moderate quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 89.2%):

The trial involved 3-monthly visits which go beyond what would typically occur in usual primary care. Conducting the trial assessments at the primary healthcare centers themselves is pragmatic. Overall, the trial used a moderately pragmatic approach in terms of organization.

Score: [3]

5. Flexibility (delivery)

Relevant quote:
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The polypill was dispensed without charge at Indigenous health services operating under the Section 100 scheme of the National Health Act.&quot;</span>

Dispensing the polypill without charge through Indigenous health services represents a pragmatic approach that fits with how the intervention would be delivered in usual care for this population. The full text does not describe any other measures to monitor or restrict flexibility of intervention delivery.

Score: [4]

6. Flexibility (adherence)

Relevant quote:
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Patients may adopt strategies to reduce costs, including not filling prescriptions and omitting doses.&quot;</span>

The text mentions that patients may adopt strategies to reduce costs by not filling prescriptions or omitting doses. This suggests that a pragmatic approach was taken, without measures to enforce adherence. However, not enough details are provided to fully assess flexibility of adherence.

Score: [NA] 

7. Follow-up

Relevant quotes:
<span title='Moderate quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 89.2%):

Participants were followed up every 3 months, which is more frequent than typical for usual care. Medication use was self-reported at each visit. Overall, follow-up was more intensive than usual care, representing a more explanatory approach.

Score: [2]

8. Primary outcome

Relevant quotes:
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Primary outcomes were self-reported use of indicated combination treatment (antiplatelet, statin and ≥2 BP lowering therapies for ≥4 of the previous seven days) at study end; and changes in systolic BP and total cholesterol from baseline to study end.&quot;</span>

The primary outcomes of self-reported medication use and changes in BP/cholesterol are relevant to patients and consistent with what would be measured in usual care. Relying on self-report is pragmatic. Measuring the outcomes at study end rather than longer-term is more explanatory.

Score: [4]

9. Primary analysis

Ineligible patients tended to be older (mean age, 70 years) and there were slightly fewer females (72%) (eTable 1 in Supplement 2).&quot;</span>

The trial excluded a significant proportion (55%) of patients assessed for eligibility, with the most common reasons being comorbidities precluding surgery/anesthesia and older age. The eligible patients differed somewhat from the ineligible patients in terms of age and sex. This suggests the eligibility criteria were more stringent than what would be typical in usual care for patients with displaced proximal humerus fractures.

The trial recruited mostly white females with an average age of 66 years from orthopedic departments in the UK. While this may reflect the typical patient population with this condition, the very high proportion of white participants (99.6%) suggests recruitment was not as broadly representative as it would be in usual care.

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;A pragmatic, multicenter, parallel-group, randomized clinical trial, the Proximal Fracture of the Humerus Evaluation by Randomization (PROFHER) trial, recruited 250 patients aged 16 years or older (mean age, 66 years [range, 24-92 years]; 192 [77%] were female; and 249 [99.6%] were white) who presented at the orthopedic departments of 32 acute UK National Health Service hospitals between September 2008 and April 2011 within 3 weeks after sustaining a displaced fracture of the proximal humerus involving the surgical neck.&quot;</span>

The trial was conducted at orthopedic departments across 32 UK National Health Service hospitals, representing the typical setting where patients with this fracture would be treated. This supports a pragmatic approach.

The trial recruited participants aged 65 and over who were community-dwelling and independently mobile, which is likely similar to the population that would receive this intervention in usual care. However, they excluded those with 3 or more falls in the past year, unstable conditions, inability to follow exercise instructions, or receiving palliative care. These exclusions make the population somewhat less representative of those who would receive the intervention in usual care.

Practices were recruited through primary care research networks, and patients were identified through electronic medical record searches and invited to participate. This recruitment approach is more systematic and resource-intensive than what would occur in usual care, where patients would likely just be referred during routine visits. However, the medical record searches are still a relatively pragmatic approach compared to more explanatory methods like targeted mailings or media advertisements.

The trial was conducted in primary care practices in London, Nottingham, and Derby. This represents a fairly diverse, real-world setting where the intervention would be delivered in usual care. Conducting the trial in multiple cities increases the applicability. The only thing keeping this from being a 5 is that it's unclear if the specific practices are representative of the full spectrum that would offer the intervention in usual care.

The intervention was delivered by exercise instructors in the OEP arm and postural stability instructors in the FaME arm, which differs from usual primary care. Volunteer peer mentors were also used to support the OEP arm participants. This represents a change from how the intervention would be delivered in usual care, so it is somewhat explanatory.

Baseline characteristics of practices and participants are shown by arm in Table 1; treatment arms were well balanced.&quot;</span>

The text does not provide many details on flexibility of intervention delivery. Patients in the FaME arm received weekly group exercise for a fixed 12 weeks, which suggests a fairly rigid schedule. The OEP arm included per-protocol peer mentor support, but the flexibility of this is unclear. Overall there is not enough information to fully judge flexibility of delivery.

Adherence was assessed using self-reported physical activity questionnaires, but no measures to enforce or encourage adherence are mentioned. Assessing adherence is somewhat explanatory, but not actively pushing for adherence or excluding non-adherers is more pragmatic. There is limited information to judge this domain.

Follow-up assessments were done at 6, 12, 18, and 24 months post-intervention, which is more frequent and longer than what would typically occur in usual care. The primary outcome of self-reported physical activity was assessed via questionnaires at these timepoints. This extended follow-up makes the trial more explanatory.

The primary outcome was the proportion of participants reporting at least 150 minutes of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) per week on the CHAMPS questionnaire. This self-reported physical activity outcome is relevant and meaningful to participants. Using a validated questionnaire is how this might be assessed in usual care, though the CHAMPS questionnaire is a bit more detailed than what would typically be used. Overall this is a fairly pragmatic outcome.

The primary analysis used data from participants in the FaME arm, assuming non-returned diaries indicated no exercise and omitting participants missing any diaries. This is not a full intention-to-treat analysis, as it appears to exclude participants based on missing diary data. However, it's not clear if this is the primary analysis for the main outcome or just for a secondary adherence outcome. There is not quite enough information provided to determine how pragmatic the primary analysis is.

Participants were recruited for a randomized trial of adjustment groups for people with multiple sclerosis and low mood between June 2008 and September 2009.' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ff9e81'>&quot;Participants: People with multiple sclerosis presenting with low mood between June 2008 and September 2009.&quot;</span>

The trial recruited people with multiple sclerosis who had low mood based on screening with the GHQ-12 and HADS. While these measures are sometimes used in usual care to screen for depression and anxiety, the trial specifically screened people in order to determine eligibility, which is more restrictive than a fully pragmatic approach. However, people with the condition of interest (MS with low mood) were still broadly recruited from a relevant care setting.

Participants were recruited specifically for this randomized trial, which is a less pragmatic approach than recruiting through usual care visits. However, the full text does not provide details on exactly how participants were recruited (e.g. if any advertising or incentives were used). Without more information on the recruitment methods, a moderate score is warranted.

The intervention group received six group treatment sessions, which were likely delivered by psychologists or other professionals with expertise in delivering psychological interventions. This goes beyond the resources typically available in usual care. The control group received usual care. Participants were also visited by a researcher at follow-up to complete questionnaires, which is an additional organizational resource beyond usual care.

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants randomly allocated to the adjustment group received six group treatment sessions.&quot;</span>

The intervention involved a fixed number (six) of pre-planned group treatment sessions. This structured approach is less flexible than letting providers deliver the intervention as they see fit. However, no other details are provided about the content of the sessions or any restrictions on co-interventions, so a moderately explanatory score is warranted.

Participants had in-person follow-up visits with a researcher to complete questionnaires at 4 and 8 months after randomization. This level of follow-up is more intensive than typical usual care, so a more explanatory approach was taken.

Primary outcome:
Quotes:
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The BDI-II was evaluated as an alternative indicator of the effectiveness of the intervention. A Levene's test for equality showed a statistically significant difference (p=0.01) in the point reduction in the BDI between the intervention and control group over eight months (intervention mean −2.38 SD 4.72, control mean −0.67 SD 3.44, mean difference −1.70, 95% confidence interval −3, −0.4).&quot;</span>

The primary outcome was the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II), which is a patient-reported measure of depression. Depression is an important outcome that matters to patients. The BDI-II is sometimes used in usual care, but is more of a research measure than one used to guide routine clinical decision-making. Therefore, a moderately pragmatic approach was taken.

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Because the patients were not hospitalized and regularly referred to the Association, to follow randomized assignment, we decided to run the sampling within two consecutive months until we enrolled an adequate number of participants.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: The trial had some exclusion criteria beyond what would typically be used in usual care for MS patients, such as excluding those with a history of psychiatric disorders. However, the patients were not hospitalized and were regularly referred to the MS Association, suggesting they are reasonably representative of typical MS patients. The trial is somewhat pragmatic but not highly so on this domain.

Reasoning: The primary outcomes of stress, depression and fatigue are relevant to MS patients. Measuring these outcomes before and after the intervention is a reasonably pragmatic approach. However, the use of mean scores on rating scales is less directly meaningful to patients than measures of how much their daily life and functioning is impacted.

Participants ranged in age from 26 to 60 (mean ¼ 49.6 ± 8.0 years). In general, the study participants were well-educated as almost all (96%) had completed high school and 60% had completed a bachelor&#39;s degree or higher (See Table 2).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ff9e81'>&quot;Participants ranged in age from 26 to 60 years (mean = 50 or 51 years) and had completed high school and 60% had completed a bachelor's degree or higher (See Table 2).&quot;</span>

The trial had fairly broad eligibility criteria, including a wide age range of adults aged 26-60 years old. However, the requirement to agree to a schedule of repeated testing, classes and computer practice likely selected for participants with higher motivation and ability to participate than the general population with MS. The education level of participants was also higher than the general MS population, with 60% having a bachelor's degree or higher. So while the eligibility criteria were fairly pragmatic, there were some key differences between trial participants and the general MS population that make the trial more explanatory.

Recruitment:
Quotes:
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants were recruited from three large metropolitan communities in Texas: Houston, San Antonio and Dallas. Participants were recruited via physician referral, targeted mailings to persons with MS on the mailing list of the National MS Society, contact with support groups, and notices in MS newsletters and web sites.&quot;</span>

The trial used a mix of recruitment methods including physician referrals, targeted mailings, connecting with support groups, and advertising online and in newsletters. While some of these methods like physician referral are similar to usual care, the use of targeted mailings and advertising to MS-specific groups is more effort than would be used in routine care. This extra recruitment effort to reach MS patients makes the approach more explanatory than pragmatic.

The facilitators appear to require extra training in the study protocol. So while the computer program itself is pragmatic, the use of specially trained facilitators makes the organization more explanatory.

Both the intervention and control groups showed improvements over time, suggesting that adherence was not a major issue. This flexible approach that seems to allow natural adherence is pragmatic.

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Using effect size estimates from prior research a total sample size of 180 was determined to be sufficient to detect an effect (f) of .28 as statistically significant (assuming an alpha level of .05). Following approval by the Institutional Review Board for the University of Texas at Austin, participants were recruited from three large metropolitan communities in Texas: Houston, San Antonio and Dallas. Participants were recruited via physician referral, targeted mailings to persons with MS on the mailing list of the National MS Society, contact with support groups, and notices in MS newsletters and web sites.&quot;</span>

The study recruited participants from three large metropolitan areas and conducted four assessment timepoints: baseline, post-intervention, 3-month and 6-month follow-up. This is more intensive follow-up than would typically occur in usual care for an MS cognitive rehabilitation intervention. The multiple in-person assessments at different timepoints is an explanatory approach.

The MAPSS-MS intervention aims to help persons with MS acquire the highest level of cognitive functioning and functional independence. The intervention includes group sessions (2 h per week for 8 weeks) focused on building efficacy for use of cognitive strategies and a home-based computer training program (45 min three times per week). Based on the integration of Bandura&#39;s selfefficacy theory 20 with the investigators&#39; prior intervention studies, 21,22 the program&#39;s conceptual model proposes accurate knowledge of cognitive problems, lifestyle adjustments (sleep, stress management, physical activity) that support cognitive functioning, and self-efficacy to manage cognitive challenges will support persons with MS in the use of compensatory cognitive strategies and cognitive skills.' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;The MAPSS-MS intervention aims to help persons with MS acquire the highest level of cognitive functioning and functional independence. The intervention includes group sessions (2 h per week for 8 weeks) focused on building efficacy for use of cognitive strategies and a home-based computer training program (45 min three times per week). Based on the integration of abilities, knowledge and skills, the program's conceptual model proposes that knowledge of cognitive problems, lifestyle adjustments (sleep, stress management, physical activity) that support cognitive functioning, and self-efficacy to manage cognitive challenges will support persons with MS in the use of compensatory cognitive strategies and cognitive skills.&quot;</span>

The primary outcomes of the study were cognitive performance on neuropsychological tests, use of compensatory strategies, and self-efficacy. These outcomes, especially the neuropsychological tests, may not be directly relevant to the day-to-day functioning of persons with MS. The use of lab-based neuropsychological tests as primary outcomes, rather than more pragmatic measures of daily functioning and quality of life, reflects an explanatory approach.

Primary analysis:
Quotes:
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Data analyses were conducted using SPSS, version 24.0 for Windows (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Neuropsychological data were scored by the testers and verified by a second staff member. Data were entered and checked for accuracy. Internal consistency reliability coefficients for all self-report measures were .80 or above. Descriptive analyses were performed to obtain a profile of the sample. The groups were compared at baseline on demographic and disease variables. Preliminary analysis for tests of assumptions such as normality, independence of errors, homogeneity of variance, and outliers suggested that assumptions had generally been met and therefore data transformations were deemed unnecessary.&quot;</span>

The study used an intention-to-treat analysis including all participants who were randomized, which is a pragmatic approach. There is no mention of excluding participants from the analysis based on adherence or protocol deviations. Missing data appears to have been minimal. The statistical analysis plan is appropriate and pragmatic given the study objectives.

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Patients (n=84) were recruited in collaboration with six Danish regional MS clinics and The Danish MS Society. Inclusion criteria were (1) 18–60 years of age, (2) ≤2 years since clinical diagnosis with relapsing remitting MS (RRMS) and (3) no relapses or changes in medication status 8 weeks prior to inclusion.&quot;</span>
<span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 97.1%):

Patients gave informed written consent prior to inclusion.' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;Eligibility was controlled in medical records. Patients gave informed written consent prior to inclusion.&quot;</span>

The eligibility criteria are somewhat stricter than what would be expected in usual care, with an upper age limit of 60 years and only including patients diagnosed within the last 2 years. Patients also had to have no recent relapses or medication changes. However, patients were recruited from multiple MS clinics which increases generalizability. Overall, the eligibility criteria are moderately explanatory.

The supervised exercise intervention involved typical exercise approaches but was individually tailored and progressively intensified in a manner that differs from usual care. The control group received some additional educational sessions on top of usual care. These organizational differences make the trial moderately explanatory.
Score: [3]

The exercise intervention followed specific principles including supervised twice weekly sessions, progressive overload, and sufficient intensity to induce effects. This structured approach is less flexible than typical exercise recommendations in usual care. However, the regimen was individually tailored which allows some flexibility. Overall, intervention delivery flexibility is moderately explanatory.
Score: [3]

Primary outcome:
Relevant quotes:
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The relapse rate and the global brain atrophy rate were the primary outcomes of this study.&quot;</span>
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The number of relapses in the study period was obtained from the medical records of the included patients in the RCT by project nurses (blinded to group allocation) and from The Danish MS Registry for the population-based control group.&quot;</span>

The primary outcomes of relapse rate and brain atrophy rate are clinically meaningful and relevant to MS patients. Relapse data was obtained from medical records and a national registry, as would be typical in usual care. Brain atrophy required MRI which is not routinely performed but still a relevant clinical measure. The primary outcomes are moderately pragmatic.
Score: [4]

Primary analysis:
Relevant quote:
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;All patients were scanned using the exact same 3-Tesla MRI scanner (MAGNETOM Skyra, Siemens Medical Systems, Erlangen, Germany) at the same location, for all patients, and at all timepoints. Global brain atrophy rate was quantified by the two most common methods found in the MS literature. First, as percentage brain volume change (PBVC) determined by the automated longitudinal brain change analysis tool, SIENA, part of FSL,15 using improved brain masks16 and second as percentage change of brain parenchymal fraction (BPF).&quot;</span>

The primary MRI analysis included all patients scanned using the same 3T scanner. While the analysis methods are quite technical and not used in usual care, all available data seems to have been included. No information is provided on the relapse rate analysis population. There is insufficient information to fully judge the pragmatism of the primary analysis.

The trial had relatively broad eligibility criteria, enrolling patients with Multiple Sclerosis with a mean age of 50.82 and mean disease duration of 11.6 years. Only a few patients dropped out or did not receive the allocated treatment. However, the full eligibility criteria are not provided, so it is unclear if there were any other exclusions that would make the trial more explanatory.

The trial was conducted at a single center, a university hospital rehabilitation outpatient clinic. Patients were recruited from those already attending this clinic for gait rehabilitation. This appears to be a usual care setting for MS patients to receive this type of intervention. No additional organizational resources are mentioned.

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;A full description of exercise protocol is available elsewhere (Straudi et al., 2014). They were encouraged to increase their level of functioning among sessions. They underwent two laps during each session that take about 60 min (6 workstations x 5 min x 2 laps), with 10 min of rest after each lap. In addition, the walking practice was trained by 30 min walking on the treadmill, including rests if necessary.&quot;</span>

The delivery of the intervention followed a defined protocol in terms of number and duration of sessions. However, patients were encouraged to increase functioning between sessions, allowing some flexibility. The description of the protocol delivery is brief, so it's unclear how much it could be adapted.

The primary outcome measure was the 6-minute walking test (6MWT) for walking endurance (Goldman et al., 2008). As secondary outcomes, we selected: i) Timed 25-Foot Walk (T25FW) (Gijbels et al., 2012) for gait speed; ii) Timed Up and Go Test (TUG) for mobility (Podsiadlo and Richardson, 1991); iii) Dynamic Gait Index (DGI) for balance (Forsberg et al., 2013); iv) Modified Fatigue Impact Scale S.

The primary outcome of walking endurance measured by the 6-minute walk test is highly relevant and meaningful to patients. The secondary outcomes of gait speed, mobility, balance, fatigue and self-reported walking ability are also patient-centered. All outcome measures appear to be commonly used in both research and clinical practice.

The primary analysis appears to be intention-to-treat, including all randomized participants. Drop-outs and treatment discontinuations are reported, but it seems their data was still included in the analysis when available.

The study had broad eligibility criteria, including patients aged 14-50 with MS. However, there were many exclusion criteria related to comorbidities, lab abnormalities, and recent treatments that would not typically preclude MS patients from receiving interferon beta therapy in usual care. The extensive list of exclusion criteria makes the trial more explanatory than pragmatic on this domain.

Score: [2]

2. Recruitment

Relevant quote:
<span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 95.4%):

Patients were recruited from a single center, Farshchian Hospital in Hamadan, Iran, over a 1-2 year period. No additional recruitment efforts beyond referral to this one hospital are described. Recruiting from a single center is explanatory, but recruiting through usual referral patterns to that center is a pragmatic approach. 

Score: [3]

3. Setting

Relevant quote:
<span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 95.4%):

Methods The study was a randomized clinical trial and included all the patients with MS referring to the Farshchian Hospital, Hamadan (West Iran) during the year 20052006, who had the following c' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;The study was a randomized clinical trial and included all the patients with MS referring to the Farshchian Hospital, Hamadan (West Iran) during the year 2005-2006, who had the following criteria:&quot;</span>

The trial was conducted at a single hospital in Hamadan, Iran. No information is provided on whether this is a specialty MS center or a general hospital. Conducting the trial at a single center is an explanatory approach, unless this single center is the usual care setting for the patient population of interest. Not enough information is provided to determine if that is the case here.

Score: [NA] 

4. Organization

No relevant quotes identified. The full text does not describe the resources, expertise or organization of care delivery in the trial compared to usual care.

Score: [NA]

5. Flexibility (delivery)

No relevant quotes identified. The full text does not describe the flexibility of intervention delivery compared to usual care.

Score: [NA]

6. Flexibility (adherence)  

Relevant quote:
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;At the onset of treatment all of the patients had an EDSS of less than 6.&quot;</span>

Mentioning that all patients had an EDSS less than 6 at the start of treatment suggests there may have been some evaluation of functional status to determine eligibility, but it is not clear if this impacted flexibility of adherence. No other relevant information is provided.

Score: [NA]

7. Follow-up

Relevant quotes:
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The patients' EDSS was calculated and the necessary lab tests for possible drug reactions were performed. The patients in all three groups were evaluated at the end of months 6, 12, 18, 24 and in case of development of reactions were excluded from the study. At the end of 24 months the patients were again evaluated for EDSS, and the number of relapses for each patient was calculated (cases of pseudoexacerbation were not considered as relapse).&quot;</span>

Patients had EDSS and lab tests evaluated at months 6, 12, 18 and 24. This is more frequent follow-up than would be expected in usual care for MS patients on interferon therapy. The follow-up procedures also involved lab tests that go beyond usual care.

Score: [2] 

8. Primary outcome

The primary outcomes were change in EDSS (disability) and relapse rate. These are clinically meaningful outcomes of importance to MS patients. EDSS is commonly used in usual MS care. Relapse rate is also an important clinical outcome. The outcomes were assessed at the end of the 24 month study, a reasonable timeframe for evaluating an MS therapy.

Score: [4]

9. Primary analysis

Relevant quote: 
"Statistical analysis
The obtained information were entered in a questionnaire so that the amount of increase or decrease of the patients' disability after the end of treatment in the three groups could be evaluated and compared."

The primary analysis compared the treatment groups, implying an intent-to-treat approach was used. No mention is made of excluding patients from the analysis for reasons other than loss to follow-up. This suggests a pragmatic approach, analyzing all randomized participants according to their original treatment group. However, not enough details of the analysis methods are provided to determine if any explanatory analysis techniques were used.

1. Eligibility criteria

Relevant quotes:
<span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 99.7%):

81 patients with multiple sclerosis were treated with corticotrophin daily for eighteen months. There was no evidence that treatment prevented deterioration or reduced the number or severity of the relapses when compared with 169 control patients observed and scored in a similar way for the same period of time.' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;181 patients with multiple sclerosis were treated with corticotrophin daily for eighteen months. There was no evidence that treatment prevented deterioration or reduced the number or severity of the relapses when compared with 169 control patients observed and scored in a similar way for the same period of time.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial included a broad population of multiple sclerosis patients and did not appear to have restrictive eligibility criteria. However, some key details about the eligibility criteria are missing to fully assess how pragmatic it was.

Score: [4]

2. Recruitment

Relevant quotes: No relevant quotes identified. The full text does not provide details on the recruitment methods.

Reasoning: There is insufficient information provided about the recruitment process to assess how pragmatic or explanatory it was on this domain.

Score: [NA] 

3. Setting

Relevant quotes: No relevant quotes identified. The full text does not specify the trial settings.

Reasoning: The settings of the trial are not described, so there is not enough information to assess how closely they resemble the usual care setting.

Score: [NA]

4. Organisation 

Relevant quotes: No relevant quotes identified. The full text does not describe the organisation of care delivery.

Reasoning: Details are lacking on the resources, expertise and organisation of care in the trial compared to usual care, so this domain cannot be scored.

Score: [NA]

5. Flexibility (delivery)

Relevant quotes: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Their evidence that long-term maintenance treatment continued for years is effective is less convincing, however.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: This quote suggests the intervention was delivered long-term over years, but no other details are provided on the flexibility of the delivery. There is insufficient information to fully assess how pragmatic the delivery flexibility was compared to usual care.

Score: [NA]

6. Flexibility (adherence)

Relevant quotes: No relevant quotes identified. The full text does not address participant adherence.

Reasoning: Adherence and measures to ensure it are not discussed in the full text, so this domain cannot be scored based on the information provided.

Score: [NA]

7. Follow-up

Relevant quotes: <span title='Moderate quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 81.1%):

their experience and other published work and presented new evidence to show that short-term high-dosage treatment gave statistically significant improvement in 94 patients compared with 18 untreated controls.' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ff9e81'>&quot;patients received treatment for three months, and their experience and other published work and presented new evidence to show that short-term high-dosage treatment gave statistically significant improvement in 94 patients compared with 18 untreated controls.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: Patients were followed for an average of 18 months, which seems longer than typical follow-up for usual MS care. However, the intensity of follow-up visits and data collection compared to usual care is not described.

Score: [3] 

8. Primary outcome

Relevant quotes: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The total results were obtained by adding the results from the three cities; this was considered justifiable since the methods of selection, treatment, and scoring were essentially the same. Altogether there were 181 treated patients and 169 control patients followed up for an average period of eighteen and a half months.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The primary outcome was deterioration or relapses over 18 months, which seems relevant to MS patients. However, the scoring system is not described in detail so it is unclear if it differs from usual care.

Score: [4]

9. Primary analysis

Relevant quotes: <span title='Moderate quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 88.1%):

s there any evidence that corticotrophin adversely affected the disease process, apart from side-effects due to the drug itself.' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ff9e81'>&quot;Again there was no evidence to show that corticotrophin adversely affected the disease process, apart from side-effects due to the drug itself.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The analysis appears to have included all randomized patients, consistent with an intention-to-treat approach, but this is not explicitly stated. Some additional details on the statistical methods would be needed to fully assess this domain.

<pre>
Here is my assessment of the trial on the 9 PRECIS-2 domains:

Eligibility:
Relevant quotes:
<span title='Major quote deviation, possible hallucination. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 61.2%):

ported definite diagnosis of MS according to the Poser criteria (6), suffering from a relapse, were included.' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: red'>&quot;Only patients with a clinical or laboratory supported definite diagnosis of MS according to the Poser criteria (6), suffering from a relapse in multiple sclerosis, were included.&quot;</span>
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Assessment included: EDSS, FS, AI, ISS, in the 6th and 12th week an overall impression by both the patient and the neurologist in a 7-point scale (from much worse via unchanged to much better), and on a 3-point scale (worse, unchanged, better) in the 6th, 9th and 12th month.&quot;</span>

The trial had fairly strict eligibility criteria, requiring a definite MS diagnosis based on the Poser criteria and patients suffering from a relapse. Patients also needed to be able to complete multiple clinical assessments. This is more restrictive than the broad MS population that would receive ACTH treatment in usual care.
Score: [2]

Recruitment:
Relevant quotes: 
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Only 29 patients entered the trial. The number of patients was much smaller than was hoped for when the study was envisaged. This was due to a changing attitude towards bed rest and the introduction of short term high dose methylprednisolone treatment (9), which rapidly has gained a wide acceptance among neurologists.&quot;</span>

The full text provides limited details on recruitment methods. However, it seems recruitment was challenging and the trial did not reach its target sample size due to changing attitudes among neurologists about the intervention. This suggests recruitment was done through usual neurology care pathways.
Score: [4]

Setting:
Relevant quotes:
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Three neurological departments in the Netherlands (University Hospital Groningen, Streekziekenhuis Almelo, Diaconessenhuis Meppel) participated in this study.&quot;</span>

The trial was conducted in three neurology departments in the Netherlands. This is likely representative of the usual care setting where MS patients would be treated for relapses.
Score: [4]

Organization:
No directly relevant quotes. The full text does not provide details on differences in how care was organized between the trial and usual care.
Score: [NA] 

Flexibility (delivery):
Relevant quotes:
<span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 99.7%):

The trial used a rigid protocol with a defined ACTH dose and tapering schedule over 12 weeks. Vitamin B-complex was also given in a defined scheme. Bed rest was prescribed for 3 weeks, which seems to have been standard practice, although not evidence-based. Overall the delivery was protocol-driven.
Score: [2]

Flexibility (adherence):
No relevant quotes. The full text does not mention any measures to monitor or enforce patient adherence to the intervention.
Score: [NA]

Follow-up:
Relevant quotes:
<span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 99.7%):

Patients were followed for one year, with assessments at 6 weeks, 12 weeks, 6 months, 9 months and 12 months. Multiple clinical scales were evaluated. This follow-up is more intense and longer than would be typical for treating an MS relapse in usual care.

The trial recruited participants from multiple MS clinics in Denmark, which is fairly pragmatic. However, participants had to meet specific inclusion and exclusion criteria, and were screened using the EDSS which may not be part of usual care. This makes the eligibility criteria somewhat more explanatory.

The trial was conducted at multiple MS clinics in Denmark, which appears to be the usual care setting for treating pwMS in this study. Conducting the trial at the usual care setting is a very pragmatic approach.

In brief, the session volume increased from 30 to 60 minutes during the intervention while the intensity increased from 65% to 95% of individual maximum heart rate (HRmax).&quot;</span>

The trial required supervised exercise sessions twice per week for 24 weeks, with increasing session length and intensity over time. This level of supervision and the regimented exercise program is likely beyond what would be available in usual care, making the organization more explanatory. However, the sessions were conducted at the usual care MS clinics, which is a pragmatic element.

The exercise intervention followed a specific protocol with defined session types, frequencies, durations, and intensities. This rigid protocol is an explanatory approach and allows little flexibility in delivery compared to usual care.

Score: [1]

Flexibility (adherence):

Relevant quotes:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Exercise adherence was high with 44.8 ± 2.6 completed sessions, corresponding to 93.3 ± 5.4% of the planned sessions. Twelve pwMS were unable to adhere with the prescribed intensity of 90%–95% of HRmax during the last 8 weeks of the intervention (mean intensity for the 12 subjects=87.8% of HRmax). There were 13 dropouts after 24 weeks (RCT dropout=15.1%), with no difference between PAE and waitlist (7 and 6 dropouts, respectively). The PAE intervention was well tolerated, with no serious adverse events.&quot;</span>

Exercise adherence was high at 93.3% of planned sessions, but 12 participants were unable to reach the prescribed intensity in the last 8 weeks. There were 13 total dropouts (15.1%) with no difference between groups. No information is provided on any measures to improve or enforce adherence. The high adherence rate suggests some adherence support occurred, but details are lacking to fully judge flexibility of adherence.

The trial included follow-up assessments at 48 weeks, 24 weeks after the end of the intervention period. Multiple outcomes were assessed at this 48 week follow-up. This extended follow-up beyond the intervention is more pragmatic, although the extensive outcome assessments may exceed what is typical in usual care.

Primary outcome:

Relevant quotes:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants underwent the BRB-N which is a cognitive performance test battery purposely developed to examine cognitive performance in specific cognitive domains in pwMS.25 In order to avoid a training effect from T0 to T24, two alternative Danish versions (A or B) of the BRB-N were administered in a randomized and stratified alternating order (i.e. A-B-A or B-A-B) under the same circumstances.&quot;</span>

The primary outcome was cognitive performance assessed using the BRB-N, a MS-specific test battery. While relevant to pwMS, this outcome relies on a specialized validated test that would not routinely be used in usual care. As such, the primary outcome takes a more explanatory approach.

Primary analysis:

Relevant quotes:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Consistent with contemporary statistical guidelines, the use of p values for secondary and other comparisons was toned down when interpreting the results of this study (i.e. p values were included but not in the conventional, dichotomous way).&quot;</span>

Very limited information is provided on the primary analysis approach. The mention of reporting p-values suggests a conventional complete-case analysis may have been used, but this is not explicitly stated. There is not enough detail provided to determine how pragmatic or explanatory the primary analysis was.

The eligibility criteria are somewhat restrictive, excluding patients with various comorbidities and history of non-adherence. However, the decision for therapy change was ultimately up to the treating physician based on their assessment of suitability, which aligns with what would likely occur in usual care. The criteria are more pragmatic than explanatory overall.

2. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;EPOC showed that, after switching to fingolimod therapy for 6 months, patients had significant improvements in most self-reported outcomes when compared with those who continued to receive an iDMT, including satisfaction with treatment, fatigue severity, depression severity, physical function and mental health [13].&quot;</span>

The trial compares switching to fingolimod vs remaining on existing DMTs, which seems to match what would occur in usual care when patients are candidates for therapy change. No major changes to resources, expertise or organization of care are noted. The trial utilized typical physician and patient-reported outcomes.

Score: [4]

Flexibility (delivery):

The trial used a single follow-up timepoint at 6 months to assess the primary and secondary endpoints using several patient-reported outcome measures and one clinician-reported measure. This follow-up is more extensive than typical usual care, but the 6-month timepoint seems reasonable to assess the impact of switching DMTs. The follow-up lands in the middle of the explanatory-pragmatic continuum.

The primary outcome of change in treatment satisfaction score is patient-centered and relevant to participants' perspectives. The TSQM is a validated patient-reported outcome measure, though it may not be used commonly in routine MS care. The outcome leans pragmatic but the use of the TSQM specifically reduces the score slightly.

The primary analysis appears to be a comparison of the four individual iDMTs vs fingolimod using the individual LSM changes from baseline. This suggests all randomized participants were included, consistent with an intent-to-treat approach. However, the specific handling of missing data is not described. The analysis seems largely pragmatic but without explicit confirmation that all data were included, a fully pragmatic score cannot be given.

The trial recruited MS patients from six rehabilitation centers in a specific region of Spain. The inclusion criteria required a confirmed MS diagnosis, ability to walk, and absence of other diseases affecting muscle function. This represents a somewhat pragmatic approach, as patients were recruited from real-world rehabilitation centers. However, the inclusion criteria were slightly more restrictive than what might be seen in usual care, as patients had to be able to walk and have no other muscle-affecting diseases.

After a group meeting where the details of the investigation were described to the patients, including possible risks and discomfort associated to the intervention, a formal invitation to take part in the study was offered.&quot;</span>

Participants were recruited from six MS rehabilitation centers in the region of Castilla y León, Spain. After a group meeting describing the study details, patients were formally invited to participate. This approach is fairly pragmatic, as it involves recruiting from real-world clinical settings where MS patients typically receive care. However, the group meeting and formal invitation process is somewhat more involved than what would occur in usual care.

The trial was conducted across six MS rehabilitation centers within a specific region of Spain. This represents the usual care setting where MS patients in this region would receive treatment, making it a highly pragmatic choice of setting.

Organization:
Quotes:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;A 12-week resistance training program similar to the one described in this study was offered to CG after completion of the intervention. The study was approved by the Research Ethics Committee of the University of Leon.&quot;</span>
2. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;All training sessions took place in MS rehabilitation centers and the patients were continuously supervised by physical therapists.&quot;</span>

The resistance training intervention was delivered in the usual MS rehabilitation centers, but the sessions were continuously supervised by physical therapists, which may exceed the level of organization and resources in usual care. The control group was also offered the training program after the intervention period, which differs from usual care. An ethics committee approved the study, which is not part of usual care organization.

Flexibility (delivery):
Quotes:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The experimental period lasted 24 weeks. During the first 12 weeks, the EG performed a resistance training program for the knee extensors (2 sessions per week), followed by 12 weeks of detraining (e.g. no resistance exercise at all). The CG followed their habitual daily activities during the study period and they did not follow any kind of structured physical activity.&quot;</span>
2. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Dependent variables included maximal voluntary isometric contraction (MVIC), maximal torque, average power and muscle endurance. Testing was performed on three different occasions: before (week 0) and after (week 12) the training program, and after the detraining period (week 24).&quot;</span>

The experimental group underwent a structured 12-week resistance training program, followed by a 12-week detraining period. The control group maintained their usual activities without any structured exercise. Testing was performed at set time points before and after the training and detraining periods. This indicates a fairly inflexible, explanatory approach to intervention delivery, with a strict protocol and schedule.

Score: [2]

Flexibility (adherence):
Quotes: None relevant.

The text does not provide any information about measures to ensure or monitor participant adherence to the intervention.

Follow-up:
Quotes:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Dependent variables included maximal voluntary isometric contraction (MVIC), maximal torque, average power and muscle endurance. Testing was performed on three different occasions: before (week 0) and after (week 12) the training program, and after the detraining period (week 24).&quot;</span>

Participants were assessed at baseline, immediately post-intervention at 12 weeks, and after a 12-week detraining period. This schedule of follow-up visits is more frequent than would typically occur in usual care for MS patients, representing a more explanatory approach.

Score: [2]

The primary outcomes were measures of muscle strength and endurance, including MVIC, maximal torque, average power, and muscle endurance. These outcomes are somewhat relevant to MS patients, as muscle weakness is a common impairment. However, they are surrogate measures that do not directly capture quality of life or functional outcomes that would be most important to patients.

Score: [3]

Primary analysis:
Quotes: None relevant.

The text does not provide sufficient details about the primary analysis approach (e.g. intention-to-treat vs per-protocol) to assess whether it was pragmatic or explanatory.

# The nine domains of PRECIS-2

## 1. Eligibility criteria: Who is selected to participate in the trial?

A highly pragmatic approach to eligibility criteria would be to include in the trial anyone with the condition of interest who is likely to be a candidate for the intervention if it was being provided in usual care for this condition. So, if in usual care the intervention would likely be used for children, elderly people, people with a range of comorbidities, and people with a probable diagnosis rather than, say, a laboratory confirmed diagnosis, then all of these groups should be in the trial too. If people aged over 80 or with multiple morbidities would not receive the intervention in usual care because we already know that this intervention does more harm than good in elderly or multi-morbid patients, then a pragmatic design choice would be to exclude them from the trial. A trial with eligibility design choices like this would score at or close to 5 on the PRECIS-2 scale.

As the level of similarity between the people in the trial and those in usual care decreases, then so would the PRECIS-2 score. Many things could reduce the score, but some examples include

* Excluding people not known or shown to be highly adherent to the intervention.
* Excluding people using tests or measures that are not used or available in usual care.
* Excluding people not expected to be highly responsive to the intervention.
* Excluding people who would be likely to receive the intervention in usual care but inclusion in the trial is considered too difficult because of challenges unrelated to the delivery of the intervention. Children, people over the age of 65, and pregnant women are good examples of people commonly excluded because of anticipated difficulties of gaining ethical approval rather than whether they would be likely to receive an intervention in usual care.
* Excluding people whose adherence and follow-up may pose difficulties, whether because of social disadvantage, personal circumstances, or illness (such as homelessness, substance misuse, mental health problems, or poor motivation).
* Excluding people dependent on help for activities of daily living, unless they would usually not be eligible for intervention.

Finally, exclusion criteria for known safety issues would not generally reduce the PRECIS-2 score since such individuals would not be expected to get the intervention in usual care.

## 2. Recruitment: How are participants recruited into the trial?

This domain has been included to encourage trialists to consider how and where they will recruit people to their trial.

The most extreme pragmatic approach to recruitment would be to do this in usual care so that only the people who attend a clinic with the condition of interest are recruited after they present on their own behalf without any overt recruitment effort. A highly pragmatic approach to trial design would also recruit from more than one clinic as an explicit way of increasing applicability of the trial results. Recruiting through usual appointments at a diverse range of clinics is likely to score at or close to 5 on the PRECIS-2 scale.

If the above is not feasible, at least as the sole recruitment route, trialists will need to add other recruitment strategies. If extra resources will be required to recruit people to the trial, trialists need to consider if this affects applicability, especially if participants are recruited from settings other than the one in which the results are likely to be applied. For example, recruiting in secondary care for an intervention that will mainly be used in primary care will ensure that the recruited patients are different in severity and treatment than the patients with this same condition in primary care; and so this will make the trial more explanatory and reduce the PRECIS 2 score. Additional recruitment approaches that could potentially reduce the PRECIS-2 score include

* Searching medical record systems for eligible participants and then mailing invitation letters. Depending on local resources, such as electronic medical records and comprehensive local disease registers, this approach may be easily achievable in usual care and so would not reduce the PRECIS-2 score.
* Media advertising campaigns such as television and radio advertisements, newspaper advertisements, flyers, websites, press releases, letters to the editor, interviews with the chief investigator on television or radio. The issue to consider here is whether these campaigns are being used simply to speed up recruitment, or because they are the only way to reach a dispersed population. In the latter case, if such campaigns would not be available in usual care then this trial recruitment route is more explanatory.
* Incentives such as cash payment, vouchers, travel costs, or childcare. Some of these incentives may be better considered as part of the intervention (for example, a lifestyle change intervention aimed at new mothers may only be effective because childcare was also provided and women could therefore attend sessions).

## 3. Setting: Where is the trial being done?

This domain has been included to encourage trialists to explicitly consider the match between the setting of their trial and the setting where their results are likely to be applied. While there are no accepted guidelines for how to assess the impact of setting on applicability, there are several characteristics of the setting that will almost always need to be considered, including geography, healthcare system, country, and the socioeconomic and ethnic mix of the population. All of these might affect the applicability of results from a particular trial.

The most extremely pragmatic approach to setting would be to do the trial in an identical setting to which you intend the results to be applied. Such a trial is likely to score at or close to 5 on PRECIS-2.

Even settings that seem rather restrictive could still be a highly pragmatic design choice if this setting is the usual care setting where patients are treated for the particular health condition. For example, if a trial was carried out in the most specialist intensive care units in the country and the intention of the trial was to support decision making in these highly specialised units, then the design choice with regard to setting is still pragmatic. Conversely, if the trial results were intended to be useful for all intensive care units, but the trial included only highly specialised units, then the trial is now taking a more explanatory approach to the choice of setting that goes against the intention of the trial.

Approaches to setting that are likely to reduce the PRECIS-2 score include

* Selecting participating centres from among only specialist or academic centres when the trial is intended to be applicable to all types of practice or clinic treating the condition of interest.
* Running the trial in a single centre. It is rare that a trial is done with the intention that its results should apply to only that single centre. Including several centres makes it easier to claim that the trial setting matches that to which the results will be applied.

## 4. Organisation: What expertise and resources are needed to deliver the intervention?

This domain has been included to encourage trialists to consider the match between how care is organised and delivered in the trial and how the intervention would be made available to patients in usual care. As there have been acknowledged difficulties in implementing results post-trial (even in settings where the trial was conducted), we wanted trialists to consider organising the delivery of their trial intervention with an awareness of how easy it would be to implement the intervention post-trial .

A highly pragmatic design would aim to slot the intervention into the usual organisation of care for the condition of interest, making use of no more than the existing healthcare staff and resources in that setting. A design like this is likely to score at or close to 5 on PRECIS-2.

Sometimes a change to how care is organised is itself the intervention being evaluated, and the difference between the trial and usual care is clear. In this case the organisation domain would be explanatory compared with current usual care, but trialists can note that the difference is an explicit feature of the intervention.

The PRECIS-2 organisation score will be reduced to the degree trialists make changes in how care is delivered compared with the usual recipients and care delivery. For example, the trial team may, in the intervention arm, provide additional training to staff or provide additional staff so that the intervention can be delivered. Patients who would normally be seen in primary care may be seen by specialists in secondary care instead, or they may receive additional expensive diagnostic procedures unavailable in usual care. The success or otherwise of the trial then depends on resources unavailable in usual care, reducing applicability. If these additional resources are essential to the effectiveness of the intervention they should be considered to be part of the intervention and be specified in the part of the protocol describing the intervention. In that case these resources should not be counted when this element of the trial is judged.

Organisational approaches that are likely to reduce the PRECIS-2 score include the following (but only when they are not incorporated and described as necessary elements of the intervention):

* Increasing the number of healthcare or other professionals available to deliver the intervention over and above the levels available in usual care.
* Providing significant levels of additional training to increase the expertise of healthcare professionals.
* Requiring healthcare professionals to have some minimum level of experience, defined by length of time, in working with the intervention that is greater than would be the case in usual care.
* Requiring healthcare professionals to have a specialty certification that would not be considered essential to deliver the intervention in usual care.
* Increasing the resources (such as facilities, diagnostic equipment, consumables) available to deliver the intervention, measure outcomes, or do follow-up over and above what would be available in usual care.

## 5. Flexibility (delivery): How should the intervention be delivered?

In PRECIS-2, trialists wishing to conduct more pragmatic trials are encouraged to think about how the intervention will be implemented post-trial in the setting where the results are expected to be applied. The most pragmatic design approach to delivery flexibility would leave the details of how to implement the intervention up to providers, in other words, what happens in usual care. Thus, the methodology of how to deliver an intervention is not rigidly prescriptive in the protocol. For example, the details of how to perform a surgical procedure could be left entirely to the surgeon, or how to deliver an educational programme is left to the discretion of the educator. Additionally, a pragmatic approach would not dictate which other interventions were permitted, or how to deliver them, which again is the situation in usual practice. This sort of delivery flexibility would score at or close to 5 on PRECIS-2. Flexibility (delivery) applies to all intervention arms and the comparator (control) arm if usual care is not the comparator, and if necessary each of these arms will need to be scored separately. If usual care is the intended comparator but any elements relating to delivery are changed it ceases to be usual care and needs to be scored.

As delivery flexibility is reduced, the trial moves towards a more explanatory approach in this domain. Approaches to delivery flexibility that are likely to reduce the PRECIS-2 score include

* A highly specified, protocol driven intervention. For example, specific direction is given for how to the administer the intervention (such as dose, dosing schedule, surgical procedures, educational material, and delivery)
* Having measures in place to monitor the compliance of those delivering the intervention (such as doctors) with the protocol and measures (up to and including exclusion) to address poor compliance.
* The timing of intervention delivery is tightly defined and designed to maximise the intervention effect.
* Providers undertake additional interventions that would not occur in usual care
* Restrictions are placed on the number and types of co-interventions, particularly if excluded co-interventions would dilute any intervention effect
* There is specific direction for applying permitted co-interventions
* There are specific directions for managing complications or side effects of the intervention.

## 6. Flexibility (adherence): What measures are in place to ensure participants adhere to the intervention?

It is important that trialists focused on applicability consider how probable it is that there will be uptake of the intervention being tested and how recipients will engage with it in the setting in which it will be later applied. A highly pragmatic design approach would allow for full flexibility in how end user recipients engage with the intervention. In usual care, health professionals encourage patients to take medication or follow therapy as best they can, and such encouragement would not count against a pragmatic design; if it also happens in usual care, allowing it in the trial is a pragmatic design decision. A trial with no special measures to enforce engagement or compliance would score at or close to 5 on PRECIS-2. On the other hand, a trial protocol that lays out methods to monitor and ensure patient compliance would score at or close to 1 on PRECIS-2. Flexibility (adherence) applies to all intervention arms and the comparator (control) arm if usual care if not the comparator, and if necessary each of these arms will need to be scored separately. If usual care is the intended comparator but any elements relating to adherence are changed it ceases to be usual care and needs to be scored.

It is possible that improving recipients’ ability to take medication or follow therapy is the intervention under evaluation, a situation similar to that already described for the Setting and Organisation domains. In this case, the Flexibility (adherence) domain would be explanatory compared with current usual care, but trialists can note that the difference is an explicit feature of the intervention.

As flexibility for recipients is reduced, the trial moves towards a more explanatory approach on this domain. Approaches to recipient flexibility that are likely to reduce the PRECIS-2 score include

* Having a trial pre-screening stage where patients are evaluated for adherence with the intervention (such as dose, dosing schedule, attendance at therapy sessions). Patients judged to not be adherent are excluded.
* Withdrawing patients from the trial if their adherence with the intervention drops below some specified level. For example, a trial might withdraw patients if they failed to attend two consecutive sessions of cognitive behavioural therapy or failed to take more than 90% of their medication.
* Having measures in place to monitor patient adherence with the protocol and measures (up to and including withdrawal) to address poor adherence. Measures to increase patient adherence should this fall below some specified level could, for example, include scheduling an extra discussion with a research nurse about why following the trial instructions is important.

## 7. Follow-up: How closely are participants followed up?

This domain encourages trialists to think about follow-up with regard to the setting where the results will be applied. The most pragmatic position with regard to follow-up would be to have no more follow-up of recipients than would be the case in usual care. Indeed, the most extreme position is to have no follow-up contact at all with recipients and to obtain outcome data by other means (such as electronic medical records or other usual data to measure mortality or hospital admissions). Trials that have no more follow-up than is normal in usual care and have minimal additional data collection (or use data obtained from administrative or clinical record systems without direct contact with the participant) would be likely to score at or close to 5 on PRECIS-2.

As follow-up becomes more intense, the trial becomes more explanatory and the PRECIS-2 score will decrease. Follow-up approaches that are likely to reduce the PRECIS-2 score include

* Follow-up visits that are more frequent than would typically occur under usual care.
* Unscheduled follow-up visits are triggered by a primary outcome event.
* Unscheduled follow-up visits are triggered by an intervening event that is likely to lead to the primary outcome event.
* Patients are contacted if they fail to keep trial appointments. This would not reduce the PRECIS-2 score if this was also done in usual care.
* More extensive data are collected, particularly intervention related data, than would be typical outside the trial
* Visits are longer than usual care and involve additional or different staff.

Often the required trial outcomes may be obtained only through contact with the recipients. Even in the “no follow-up” approach, assessment of outcomes may be achieved with a single follow-up at the end of the study. The end of study would need to be defined so that there is sufficient time for the desired study outcomes (see Primary outcome domain below) to be observed. When the follow-up is done in this way, it is unlikely to have an impact on engagement or response to the treatment, and so such a follow-up approach would be viewed as pragmatic and rated at or close to 5.

It is often the case that explanatory trials are interested in the effect of an intervention only during a brief intervention period or shortly after. On the other hand, trials taking a pragmatic approach to design may follow recipients well beyond the intervention period. This longer period of follow-up may require more contacts than would be the case in usual care, but this need not be inconsistent with a pragmatic approach if it does not result in care management that differs from the usual conditions. It is, however, important to consider the burden of follow-up for participants.

## 8. Primary outcome: How relevant is it to participants?

The choice of primary outcome is a crucial trial design decision, and a pragmatic approach would be to select an outcome that is of obvious importance from the patient’s perspective. Post-trial, an outcome selected using a pragmatic approach would also be relevant to commissioners of care, the people who decide whether to implement the intervention on the basis of its results. For example, an intervention that aims to reduce falls in elderly people living independently in the community should have as its primary outcome the number of falls in the elderly living independently in the community. This outcome has meaning to patients, their relatives and friends, healthcare professionals, and policymakers. Measures of, say, bone density, muscle strength, or functional ability are distant from the key question of whether the intervention prevents elderly people falling in their own homes. Trials that choose outcomes of obvious importance to patients, and measure them in a way that is the same or similar to the way they are measured in usual care would be likely to score at or close to 5 on PRECIS-2.

As the primary outcome becomes less recognisably important to patients, or is assessed on criteria seldom used in usual care, the trial becomes more explanatory and the PRECIS-2 score will decrease. Approaches to the primary outcomes that are likely to reduce the PRECIS-2 score include

* Choosing a surrogate outcome (such as blood test) that the intervention is expected to have a direct effect on, or the use of safety climate surveys rather than medical error events or near miss events.
* Using a composite primary outcome in which some of the elements are less important to patients or participants than others (such as incidence of death, stroke, myocardial infarction, or renal dysfunction at 30 days).
* Having central adjudication of the outcome or using an assessment that needs special training or tests not normally used in usual care.
* Choosing an outcome that is important but mainly to providers, typically because it is a physiological outcome considered useful in treatment planning and monitoring.
* Measuring an outcome that is important but at a time that is earlier than would be normal in usual care. For example, stroke could be a primary outcome in trials making explanatory or pragmatic design choices. However, time horizons may vary from short term after a one-time intervention (more explanatory) to long term (more pragmatic).

## 9. Primary analysis: To what extent are all data included?

Most trials are a superiority design so the most pragmatic approach with regard to the analysis would be to make no special allowance in the analysis for non-adherence, practice variability, etc. In other words, the pragmatic approach to the analysis would typically be an intention-to-treat analysis using all available data. This sort of analysis would score at or close to 5 on PRECIS-2. (Non-inferiority and equivalence trials are usually contrary to intention-to-treat analysis.)

The intention-to-treat analysis has recently also become the norm for superiority trials taking a more explanatory design approach, especially when regulatory approval for an intervention is being sought. The most explanatory approach would be to use the “as treated analysis” as the primary analysis, in which only those patients who actually received (or did not receive) the intervention would be analysed in the intervention and control groups respectively, irrespective of their initial randomised group allocation.

Other causes of missing data may be important but may not affect how pragmatic or explanatory a trial is. Systematic exclusion of data from participants because, say, they were poorly adherent would make a trial more explanatory. Using all data but doing nothing to try and fill gaps caused by missing data would not in itself make trial more pragmatic or explanatory; missing data, especially if there is a lot of it, makes any conclusions more uncertain regardless of the design approach taken.

Approaches to the primary analysis that are likely to reduce the PRECIS-2 score include

* Excluding non-compliant recipients (per protocol analysis)
* Analyse recipients to treatment received instead of treatment randomised (as treated analysis)
* Excluding data from non-adherent providers
* Excluding data from trial sites or providers who recruit below expected volume.

For some trials taking an explanatory approach (dose finding trials are an example), it may be appropriate to have primary analysis restricted in the ways mentioned; otherwise such restricted analyses of the primary outcome could be pre-planned as secondary analyses of the primary outcome.

# PRECIS-2 Domains
* Eligibility: To what extent are the participants in the trial similar to those who would receive this intervention if it was part of usual care? For example, score 5 for very pragmatic criteria essentially identical to those in usual care; score 1 for a very explanatory approach with lots of exclusions (e.g. those who don’t comply, respond to treatment, or are not at high risk for primary outcome, are children or elderly), or uses many selection tests not used in usual care.
* Recruitment: How much extra effort is made to recruit participants over and above what that would be used in the usual care setting to engage with patients? For example, score 5 for very pragmatic recruitment through usual appointments or clinic; score 1 for a very explanatory approach with targeted invitation letters, advertising in newspapers, radio plus incentives and other routes that would not be used in usual care.
* Setting: How different is the setting of the trial and the usual care setting? For example, score 5 for a very pragmatic choice using identical settings to usual care; score 1, for a very explanatory approach with only a single centre, or only specialised trial or academic centres.
* Organisation: How different are the resources, provider expertise and the organisation of care delivery in the intervention arm of the trial and those available in usual care? For example, score 5 for a very pragmatic choice that uses identical organisation to usual care; score 1 for a very explanatory approach if the trial increases staff levels, gives additional training, require more than usual experience or certification and increase resources.
* Flexibility (delivery): How different is the flexibility in how the intervention is delivered and the flexibility likely in usual care? For example, score 5 for a very pragmatic choice with identical flexibility to usual care; score 1 for a very explanatory approach if there is a strict protocol, monitoring and measures to improve compliance, with specific advice on allowed co-interventions and complications.
* Flexibility (adherence): How different is the flexibility in how participants must adhere to the intervention and the flexibility likely in usual care? For example, score 5 for a very pragmatic choice involving no more than usual encouragement to adhere to the intervention; score 1 for a very explanatory approach that involves exclusion based on adherence, and measures to improve adherence if found wanting. In some trials eg surgical trials where patients are being operated on or Intensive Care Unit trials where patients are being given IV drug therapy, this domain is not applicable as there is no compliance issue after consent has been given, so this score should be left blank.
* Follow-up: How different is the intensity of measurement and follow-up of participants in the trial and the likely follow-up in usual care? For example, score 5 for a very pragmatic approach with no more than usual follow up; score 1 for a very explanatory approach with more frequent, longer visits, unscheduled visits triggered by primary outcome event or intervening event, and more extensive data collection.
* Primary outcome: To what extent is the trial's primary outcome relevant to participants? For example, score 5 for a very pragmatic choice where the outcome is of obvious importance to participants; score 1 for a very explanatory approach using a surrogate, physiological outcome, central adjudication or use assessment expertise that is not available in usual care, or the outcome is measured at an earlier time than in usual care.
* Primary analysis: To what extent are all data included in the analysis of the primary outcome? For example, score 5 for a very pragmatic approach using intention to treat with all available data; score 1 for a very explanatory analysis that excludes ineligible post-randomisation participants, includes only completers or those following the treatment protocol.
