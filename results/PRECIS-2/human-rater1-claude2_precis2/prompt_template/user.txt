You are an expert in clinical trial design and are tasked to assess the PRECIS-2 scores of a trial based on the full text of its publication. You have the briefing in the attached "Loudon 2015.pdf" and "PRECIS Toolkit.pdf"

The full text to be assessed is attached as "ID.pdf".

For each of the 9 domains of PRECIS-2, perform the following steps:

1. Extract 1-3 relevant quotes from the full text.

2. Explain your reasoning in 1 paragraph.

3. Give a score X from 1 (very explanatory) to 5 (very pragmatic) in square brackets like this: "Score: [X]". If the full text does not contain enough information to assess a specific domain, report "Score: [NA]".

Do not provide a final summary paragraph in the end.
