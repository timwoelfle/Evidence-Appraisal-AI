The purpose of this review was to determine the place of MIA in children. Methods: The authors conducted a systematic review of the pediatric and adult literature about MIA, focusing on the technique and indications. Results: Minimally invasive adrenalectomy appears superior to open adrenalectomy for small tumors. The potential advantages of MIA are appealing for postoperative pain, risk of intestinal obstruction, and quality of scars. The most common approach is the transperitoneal lateral laparoscopy, which allows for a large working space. For small tumors or for bilateral adrenalectomy, the prone retroperitoneoscopy is a promising new technique. In children, the learning curve is an issue because the indications are rare. The most common indication is neuroblastoma without image-defined surgical risk factors. The incidence of local recurrence is low, but the follow-up is short in most cases.

158,PRISMA,"Perhaps the most important issue to consider is that of patient selection. The authors were unable to extract enough data regarding tumor size, tumor location, or residual amount of healthy parenchyma to tease out their effects on patient selection. Previous studies by Cost et al. [15] and Ferrar et al. [42] suggest that only 25% of children with unilateral WT are candidates for NSS; however, only 1% of these children actually undergo NSS [34]. Thus, one of the goals of future research efforts should be to determine which children can safely undergo NSS. In a recent abstract, Ehrlich et al. reported on 39 patients with unilateral WT who underwent NSS. The authors found that 9/39 (23%) were found to have positive margins or intraoperative tumor spill; these patients thus would have received additional chemotherapy and radiation owing to surgical factors. Despite this, the 5-year overall survival in those patients was 96%. Although this study has to date only been reported in abstract form, the presented data seems to imply that at least some of these tumors may not have been appropriate candidates for NSS. Preoperative tumor weights in these patients ranged from 133 to 1,870 g, whereas 13 patients had Stage II or III disease. Further, based on the fact that 13/39 (33%) patients did not undergo formal lymphadenectomy as recommended, one can perhaps conclude that the surgeons involved in those cases may not have been fully up to date on standard COG guidelines [34]. NSS feasibility, however, can be aided by preoperative imaging and was associated with a sensitivity of 87%, specificity of 97%, and accuracy of 93% [43]. As noted previously, NSS is a technically demanding procedure that requires significant expertise both in patient selection and technical ability and experience.",fulltext,"Perhaps the most important issue to consider is that of patient selection.

Similar to the ALARA (As Low As Reasonably Achievable) principle adopted by radiologists [35], it will not be long before anesthesiologists, pediatricians and neonatologists adopt a similar mantra. Irrespective of some surgeon's current preference to use general anesthesia with flap closure, this technique represents the only reasonable method to close the abdominal defect without general anesthesia.",100.0

169,PRISMA,"While a previous investigation demonstrated no difference in surgical site infections (SSI) when comparing GS closures performed in the operating room versus the neonatal intensive care unit, concerns remain about the potential to increase infections at the site of closure if not performed under optimal conditions in the OR [30]. This meta-analysis revealed a decrease in SSI rates with the sutureless technique when compared to fascial closure. Several caveats require consideration when considering this conclusion: not all flap closures were performed in the NICU and the definition of an SSI was non-standardized across studies. Indeed, most closure sites appear erythematous and may grow skin flora if cultured; the diagnosis of a true infection is, therefore, challenging to make. Nonetheless, fascial cases act as internal controls within each study framework, suggesting that true differences likely exist favoring flap closure. This advantage may be because of the avoidance of surgical trauma to the area, although further mechanistic studies are required to clarify this issue.",fulltext,"While a previous investigation demonstrated no difference in surgical site infections (SSI) when comparing GS closures performed in the operating room versus the neonatal intensive care unit, concerns remain about the potential to increase infections at the site of closure if not performed under optimal conditions in the OR [30].

In comparison with SBTX, both procedures have less associated complications and are independent of the availability of donor organs [67]. The choice for one of both surgical options is essentially driven by feasibility of the procedures and the associated outcome. From the technical perspective STEP has many clear advantages over LILT (Table 4), as during STEP procedure the manipulation and dissection of the mesentery and vasculature are not necessary, which reduces the chance of vascular compromises in comparison with LILT [59]. STEP can be applied to reduce varying degrees of bowel dilatation and may be performed on short and asymmetrical segments of dilated bowel [36,60], which is not feasible with LILT. In intricate intestinal segments, such as the duodenum and adjacent jejunum, only STEP is feasible [34,38].",fulltext,"Therefore, LILT and STEP are complementary and supportive to further therapeutic approaches.

98,PRISMA,"Extensive mobilization of the spermatic vessels and the vas is one of the advantages of laparoscopy, which is very important for a successful orchiopexy [14, 31]. Conventional inguinal orchidopexy may not achieve adequate length of testicular vessels despite extensive retroperitoneal dissection and division of inferior epigastric vessels [31]. A literature review based on 64 articles containing 8,425 undescended testicles showed unsatisfactory success rates by the open procedure for intra-abdominal testes: 67% for Fowler–Stevens, 77% for staged Fowler–Stevens, 81% for transabdominal, and 84% for intravascular orchidopexy [19]. In contrast, the success rate of laparoscopic orchiopexy (either primary or staged orchopexy) for management of abdominal NPT was reported to be greater than 90% [32–37]. Abolyosr et al. [9] reported a very similar overall success rate between OO and LO in children with peeping testes. It has been believed that compared with OO, LO may have some advantages in children with high intra-abdominal testes, because the conventional open orchidopexy may not achieve an adequate length of testicular vessels [19]. In this meta-analysis, we found no significant difference in the overall success rate and recurrence between the LO and OO groups, and the success rates were well in the range of previous studies [9, 19, 28, 38]. Combined with the fact that the total operative cost was significantly higher when laparoscopy was performed, these results may suggest that the advantages of laparoscopy could be achieved by open surgery, with a favorable cost benefit ratio. However, we noted that earlier studies reported the unnecessary open surgery following diagnostic laparoscopy [5, 10, 12].
