<p><i><span style="border-bottom: 1px dashed black;">11 quote(s) from
publication full text</span> (mean similarity 100%)</i></p>
<pre>
Here are the PRECIS-2 domain scores and explanations for the given trial:

1. Eligibility criteria

Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Pregnant women were eligible if they were to undergo delivery by lower segment caesarean section through a transverse abdominal incision, irrespective of fever in labour, gestational age, or multiple pregnancies.&quot;</span>
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Women were not eligible if there was a clear indication for a particular surgical technique or material to be used that prevented any of the allocated interventions being used, if they had more than one previous caesarean section, or if they had already been recruited into the trial.&quot;</span>

Explanation: The eligibility criteria are quite broad, including women undergoing first or second caesarean section, irrespective of gestational age or presence of fever. The only exclusions are if there is a clear indication for a particular technique, more than one previous caesarean section, or previous recruitment into the trial. This suggests the trial intends to recruit a patient population similar to routine practice.

Score: [4] Rather pragmatic

2. Recruitment

Quotes: 
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Each participating site, advised by their research ethics committee, decided how to provide trial information to women and seek informed consent.&quot;</span>

Explanation: The paper does not provide much detail on the recruitment process. However, it seems that participants were recruited during their routine prenatal care, as the trial was discussed with eligible women and consent obtained. There is no mention of any special recruitment efforts. 

Score: [4] Rather pragmatic

3. Setting

Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;CORONIS was undertaken at 19 sites in Argentina, Chile, Ghana, India, Kenya, Pakistan, and Sudan.&quot;</span>

Explanation: The trial was conducted across multiple sites in 7 countries. The sites appear to be routine maternity care settings in these countries, rather than specialized trial or academic centers. This matches the real-world settings where caesarean sections are performed.

Score: [5] Very pragmatic

4. Organization

Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Each regional coordinator (one per country, except India, which was split into two regions) started and documented a training programme that ensured that surgeons operating within the trial were familiar with the techniques being compared before participating.&quot;</span>

Explanation: The paper mentions that surgeons received training on the techniques being compared, but does not suggest any other changes to staffing, resources, or care delivery compared to routine practice. The caesarean sections seem to have been incorporated into standard care at the participating sites.

Score: [5] Very pragmatic 

5. Flexibility: Delivery

Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;All non-allocated surgical elements and all other aspects of the caesarean section procedure were undertaken at the discretion of the surgeon.&quot;</span> 
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;In particular, there were no restrictions on the type of suture material that could be used, and standard measures to achieve haemostasis were employed regardless of the allocated intervention.&quot;</span>

Explanation: The surgeons had flexibility in how the allocated intervention was delivered along with all other aspects of care. No protocol was enforced aside from the allocated technique. This matches the flexibility found in routine practice.

Score: [5] Very pragmatic

6. Flexibility: Adherence

Quotes: None relevant

Explanation: The paper does not mention any strategies to enforce or monitor participant adherence. There is no discussion of withdrawal criteria or measures to improve adherence. 

Score: [5] Very pragmatic

7. Follow-up

Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Data were collected at trial entry, immediately after surgery, at hospital discharge (including hospital transfer or death), and at about 6 weeks after delivery.&quot;</span>
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Women who did not return at 6 weeks were located and interviewed by telephone or during a home visit.&quot;</span>

Explanation: Follow-up consisted of data collection at standard time points through 6 weeks post-delivery. Women were contacted if they did not return for the 6 week follow-up. This does not seem substantially different from routine follow-up after delivery.

Score: [4] Rather pragmatic

8. Primary Outcome

Quotes: 
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The primary outcome was a composite of death, maternal infectious morbidity, further operative procedures, or blood transfusion of more than 1 unit of whole blood or packed cells up to the 6-week follow-up visit.&quot;</span>

Explanation: The primary outcome is a composite of major maternal complications that are clinically meaningful to patients. The components would be routinely assessed in practice.

Score: [5] Very pragmatic

9. Primary Analysis

Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Women were analysed in the groups into which they were allocated.&quot;</span>

Explanation: The paper states an intention-to-treat approach was used. All randomized participants were included in the analysis in their allocated groups. No data were excluded.

Score: [5] Very pragmatic</pre>

<p><i><span style="border-bottom: 1px dashed black;">8 quote(s) from
publication full text</span> (mean similarity 99.6%)</i></p>
<pre>
Here are the PRECIS-2 domain scores and explanations for the given full text:

1. Eligibility criteria

Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Patients with a clinically established diagnosis of type 2 diabetes mellitus were sent a letter by their GPs to introduce the SMS project.&quot;</span>

The eligibility criteria appear to closely match patients who would receive this intervention in usual care. Patients already diagnosed with type 2 diabetes by their GP were eligible. No exclusions are mentioned based on age, comorbidities, adherence, etc.

Score: [5] Very pragmatic

2. Recruitment

Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The enclosed self-administered questionnaire consisted of the screening instruments that intervention PNs would also apply for SMS in their routine practice.&quot;</span>

Patients were recruited via a mailed screening questionnaire to their home. This requires some additional effort compared to recruitment during routine appointments. 

Score: [3] Equally pragmatic and explanatory 

3. Setting

Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The study was conducted between November 2011 and February 2013 and was registered in a Dutch public trial registry [NTR2764].&quot;</span>

The setting appears to be routine primary care clinics in the Netherlands. No details suggest it differs from the usual care setting.

Score: [5] Very pragmatic

4. Organization

Quote: <span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 98%):

s in the intervention arm (n=19) were trained to integrate SMS into their routine consultations.' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;PNs in the intervention arm (n=19) were trained to integrate SMS into their routine consultations.&quot;</span>

The PNs received some additional training, but otherwise the existing staff and resources were used to deliver the intervention as part of routine care.

Score: [4] Rather pragmatic

5. Flexibility: delivery

Quote: <span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 98.9%):

SMS included a detection and follow-up phase. The flow chart of SMS is presented in figure 1.' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;SMS included detection and follow-up phases. The flow chart of SMS is presented in figure 1.&quot;</span> 

The delivery of the intervention follows a protocol with screening tools and criteria for follow-up support or referral. This reduces flexibility compared to usual care.

Score: [2] Rather explanatory

6. Flexibility: adherence

No clear information on measures to enforce patient adherence.

Score: [NA]

7. Follow-up

Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;We used postal questionnaires for patient measurements.&quot;</span>

Patients were followed up via mailed questionnaires at 4 and 12 months. This provides some additional follow-up contact compared to usual care.

Score: [3] Equally pragmatic and explanatory

8. Primary outcome  

Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The primary outcome measure was a dichotomised score on a Visual Analogue Scale that measured the perceived effect of diabetes on daily functioning.&quot;</span>

The primary outcome of daily functioning is highly relevant for patients.

Score: [5] Very pragmatic 

9. Primary analysis

Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Analyses were performed on an intention-to-treat basis.&quot;</span>

An intention-to-treat analysis was used including all available data.

Score: [5] Very pragmatic</pre>

Here are the PRECIS-2 domain scores and explanations for the given full text:

Eligibility criteria 
Score: [2] Rather explanatory

Relevant quotes: 
<span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Inclusion criteria—Patients with confirmed diagnosis: ≥16 years of age with unilateral facial nerve weakness of no identifiable cause who presented to primary care or an emergency department and could be referred to a collaborating otorhinolaryngologist <72 hours after the onset of symptoms.&quot;</span>
<span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Exclusion criteria—Pregnancy, breast feeding, uncontrolled diabetes, peptic ulcer disease, suppurative otitis media, herpes zoster, multiple sclerosis, systematic infection, sarcoidosis and other rare conditions, and an inability to provide informed consent.&quot;</span>  

The eligibility criteria are rather narrow, excluding many patients who would be eligible in usual care such as those with comorbidities. Confirmation by a specialist otorhinolaryngologist is also more stringent than typical primary care.

Recruitment
Score: [2] Rather explanatory

Relevant quotes:  
<span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Randomised controlled trial of Bell’s palsy treatment required senior otorhinolaryngologist in hospitals to confirm a patient’s eligibility to participate. Bell’s palsy is usually diagnosed by a general practitioner in primary care.&quot;</span>

Recruitment requires referral to a specialist which is more intensive than typical primary care recruitment.

Setting
Score: [NA]

No relevant quotes provided to assess setting.

Organization
Score: [NA] 

No relevant quotes provided to assess organization.

Flexibility: delivery
Score: [NA]

No relevant quotes provided to assess flexibility of delivery.

Flexibility: adherence 
Score: [NA]

No relevant quotes provided to assess flexibility of adherence.

Follow-up
Score: [1] Very explanatory

Relevant quotes:
<span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Clinical follow-up until patient left hospital (discharge or death) or until 30 days after surgery, whichever was the longer, so more than usual care.&quot;</span>
<span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Monitoring intensity involved more extensive data collection than usual: Pre-operation—three-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) Holter monitor (Flashcard with 2×48 hour recording) set up on each patient and maintained for 72 hours. Troponin values at 1, 3, and 7 days after surgery (more usual for only 1 and 3 days after surgery) ECG after randomisation and at 7 and 30 days after surgery.&quot;</span> 
<span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Unscheduled follow-up visits triggered by primary outcome: a cardiovascular event (such as angina, myocardial infarction, stroke)&quot;</span>

Follow-up is much more extensive than usual care, with additional tests and visits.

Primary outcome
Score: [1] Very explanatory 

Relevant quotes: 
<span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Primary outcome—Recovery of facial function as rated on the House-Brackmann scale.&quot;</span>  
<span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Test not routinely used in primary care and requires training. It is, however, an easy clinical test widely used in secondary care for grading recovery from facial nerve paralysis caused by damage to lower motor neurons.&quot;</span>
<span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Central adjudication—Photographs taken of patients were assessed and graded independently by a panel of three experts (not general practitioners, who usually assess).&quot;</span>

The primary outcome uses a rating scale and central adjudication not typical of primary care.

Primary analysis
Score: [NA]

No relevant quotes provided to assess primary analysis.</pre>

Here are the PRECIS-2 domain scores and explanations for the given trial:

Eligibility criteria 
Quotes:
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Patient selection criteria were having a diagnosis of moderate-to-severe COPD (a Body mass index, Airflow obstruction, dyspnoea and Exercise capacity [BODE] index score of 3–7) according to international guidelines and having been clinically stable for the previous 4 weeks.&quot;</span>

<span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;We think there are four steps to using PRECIS-2&quot;</span> [...] <span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Step 2: Consider your trial design choices for each of the nine PRECIS-2 domains&quot;</span>

Explanation: The eligibility criteria included patients with moderate to severe COPD based on BODE index score. Patients also had to be clinically stable for 4 weeks prior to enrollment. The criteria seem reasonably inclusive for the target population of interest.

Score: [4] Rather pragmatic

Recruitment  
Quotes:
<span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 99.3%):

This was a multicentre open-label pragmatic parallel-group randomized clinical trial involving 13 hospitals and was conducted between 2014 and 2017' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;This was a multicentre open-label pragmatic parallel-group randomized clinical trial involving 13 hospitals and was conducted between 2014 and 2017.&quot;</span>

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Randomized patients (recruitment visit, −1) attended an initial 8-week outpatient-based PR programme conducted in each hospital rehabilitation department.&quot;</span>

Explanation: Patients were recruited from multiple hospitals and settings where they were already receiving usual care. No extra recruitment efforts beyond standard practice are mentioned.

Score: [5] Very pragmatic 

Setting
Quote: 
<span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 99.3%):

This was a multicentre open-label pragmatic parallel-group randomized clinical trial involving 13 hospitals and was conducted between 2014 and 2017' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;This was a multicentre open-label pragmatic parallel-group randomized clinical trial involving 13 hospitals and was conducted between 2014 and 2017.&quot;</span>

Explanation: The trial was conducted across 13 hospitals, suggesting a diverse and multi-center setting similar to real-world practice.

Score: [5] Very pragmatic

Organisation
Quote:
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The hospital-based outpatient programme consisted of three training sessions a week which included 30 min of weight lifting and 30 min of leg cycle ergometry along with four educational sessions which included chest physiotherapy training.&quot;</span> 

Explanation: The intensive PR program was delivered through existing hospital resources and staff. No additional resources or expertise were described.

Score: [5] Very pragmatic

Flexibility: delivery
Quote:
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Patients in the IG were asked to continue at home with a similar training schedule to that completed in the hospital. They were provided with, for the 12-month follow-up period, a telerehabilitation kit (mobile phone, pulse oximeter, dumbbells and exercise bicycle) along with a user guide with detailed instructions on the use of the mobile device to deliver data collected to the web-based platform after completion of each scheduled session.&quot;</span>

Explanation: Patients were given specific instructions and technology to follow the prescribed exercise regimen at home. This reduces flexibility in delivery compared to usual care.

Score: [2] Rather explanatory

Flexibility: adherence 
Quote:
<span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;In usual care, health professionals encourage patients to take medication or follow therapy as best they can, and such encouragement would not count against a pragmatic design; if it also happens in usual care, allowing it in the trial is a pragmatic design decision.&quot;</span>

Explanation: The trial allowed for flexibility in patient adherence, similar to usual care. No special measures were taken to enforce adherence.

Score: [5] Very pragmatic

Follow-up
Quote:  
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;After the randomization visit, follow-up appointments were arranged for both groups at 3, 9 and 12 months.&quot;</span>

Explanation: Follow-up schedule matches what would be typical in usual care.

Score: [5] Very pragmatic

Primary outcome
Quote:
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Exercise tolerance (the ability to sustain exercise) was assessed using distance covered in the 6MWT.&quot;</span>

Explanation: The 6MWT is a clinically meaningful outcome directly relevant to patients.

Score: [5] Very pragmatic

Primary analysis
Quote: 
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Missing values were not imputed. All patients were analyzed in the group to which they were randomized.&quot;</span>

Explanation: An intention-to-treat approach was used with no exclusion of non-compliers. This matches real-world practice.

Score: [5] Very pragmatic

In summary, this trial incorporates pragmatic design choices for most domains, with the exception of flexibility in delivery of the intervention. The overall design seems reasonably pragmatic based on the PRECIS-2 criteria.</pre>

Here are the PRECIS-2 domain scores and explanations for the given full text:

Eligibility criteria 
Score: [4] Rather pragmatic

Relevant quotes: 
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Eighty people with Expanded Disability Status scores of 1 to 6.5 participated in this trial.&quot;</span>
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Inclusion criteria were as follows: (1) diagnosed with MS in accordance with the McDonald criteria; (2) registered at the MS outpatient clinic; (3) living in 1 of 6 selected municipalities; (4) aged 18 years or older; (5) capable of providing signed written informed consent; and (6) EDSS score between 1 and 6.5 (1 = minor disability, 6.5 = able to walk 20 m with or without a walking aid).&quot;</span>

The eligibility criteria are fairly broad, including adults with mild to moderate MS based on EDSS scores. The criteria seem to match reasonably well with patients who would receive this intervention in usual care. The inclusion of patients across a range of disability levels makes this domain rather pragmatic.

Recruitment
Score: [4] Rather pragmatic 

Relevant quotes:
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;In August 2015, 1 of the MS nurses at the Department of Neurology, Nordland Hospital Trust in Bodø, Norway, sent out invitation letters with a consent form to 160 persons with MS who were registered at the MS outpatient clinic, had EDSS scores of 0 to 7, and lived in 1 of the 6 municipalities included in the study.&quot;</span>

Participants were recruited from an MS clinic registry, which seems reasonably similar to how patients would be engaged for this intervention in usual care. Sending invitation letters to participate is more effort than purely opportunistic recruitment during clinic visits, but is still a fairly pragmatic approach.

Setting
Score: [5] Very pragmatic

Relevant quotes: 
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The GroupCoreDIST intervention was conducted by 6 physical therapists in 6 municipalities in Norway.&quot;</span>

The intervention was delivered in multiple municipalities, suggesting a range of standard care settings where MS patients would receive physical therapy. This diversity of settings makes it very pragmatic.

Organization
Score: [4] Rather pragmatic

Relevant quote:  
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Six neurological physical therapists conducted the intervention after being trained in GroupCoreDIST for 5 days.&quot;</span>

Having specialized physical therapists conduct the intervention requires some additional training and expertise beyond usual care. However, the therapists already had background in neurological physical therapy, so the increment in expertise was modest. Overall, the organization seems reasonably similar to usual care.

Flexibility: delivery
Score: [4] Rather pragmatic

Relevant quotes:
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The physical therapists had varied experience (between 7–25 years) and certification (2 had both a master’s degree in neurological physical therapy and were clinical specialists in neurological physical therapy, 1 was a clinical specialist in neurological physical therapy, and 3 were generalists in physical therapy).&quot;</span>

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The physical therapists conducted an individual clinical examination of each participant. The examinations were followed by group sessions, in which the physical therapists chose from 33 exercises, all with 5 levels of difficulty to address each individual’s impairments underlying his or her balance disturbance.&quot;</span> 

The protocol allows flexibility in exercise selection and progression based on each patient's impairments and abilities. However, there is more structure and monitoring compared to complete flexibility as in usual care.

Flexibility: adherence
Score: [5] Very pragmatic

Relevant quote: 
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants in the intervention group were encouraged not to seek any physical therapy other than GroupCoreDIST during the 6 weeks of the intervention.&quot;</span>

No special measures were used to enforce or monitor adherence. Patients were free to participate and engage with the intervention as in usual care.

Follow-up
Score: [2] Rather explanatory

Relevant quotes:
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Assessments were undertaken at baseline and at weeks 7, 18, and 30.&quot;</span>

The intensive follow-up schedule with multiple post-intervention assessments is more frequent than would occur in usual care.

Primary outcome
Score: [4] Rather pragmatic

Relevant quotes: 
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Outcomes were measured with the Trunk Impairment Scale–Norwegian Version, Mini Balance Evaluation Systems Test, and Patient Global Impression of Change–Balance.&quot;</span>

The outcomes focus on balance and trunk control which are meaningful patient-centered measures. The scales used are clinically relevant but require some specialized testing beyond usual care.

Primary analysis
Score: [5] Very pragmatic

Relevant quote:
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Repeated-measures mixed models were used for statistical analysis.&quot;</span> 

The analysis seems to follow an intention-to-treat approach, consistent with a very pragmatic attitude.</pre>

<p><i><span style="border-bottom: 1px dashed black;">7 quote(s) from
publication full text</span> (mean similarity 100%)</i></p>
<pre>
Here are the PRECIS-2 domain scores and explanations for the trial described in the full text:

Eligibility criteria 
Score: [3]

Relevant quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Inclusion criteria were diagnosis of PPMS or SPMS, Internet access and some level of distress determined by a score of 3 or greater on the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12).&quot;</span>

The eligibility criteria are a mix of pragmatic and explanatory. Including only patients with PPMS and SPMS matches the intended intervention population. Requiring internet access and a minimum distress score makes the sample less representative of the overall PPMS/SPMS population. Overall, the criteria are equally pragmatic and explanatory.

Recruitment
Score: [2] 

Relevant quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;We recruited potential participants through adverts on the MS Society website and from National Health Service (NHS) MS centres across the UK.&quot;</span>

Recruitment involved advertising online and at specialty clinics, which requires more effort than recruiting patients already seeking care. This explanatory approach likely results in a less representative sample.

Setting
Score: [4]

Relevant quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;We delivered the programme in eight hour-long sessions over an eight-week period via Skype video conferences.&quot;</span>

The setting of videoconference is pragmatic as it can be delivered in participants' homes, like usual care.

Organization
Score: [5]

Relevant quote: No additional organization/resources described beyond the videoconferencing.

The intervention does not require additional staff or resources beyond what would be used in usual care.

Flexibility: Delivery
Score: [4]

Relevant quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The format and manual for the mindfulness group, including length of sessions and individual mindfulness practices, were developed in partnership with patients with MS through initial experimental case studies.&quot;</span>

The delivery allows some flexibility based on patient input in the design, but follows a manualized protocol. Overall, it is between very pragmatic and very explanatory.

Flexibility: Adherence 
Score: [5] 

Relevant quote: No exclusion based on adherence. No specific adherence monitoring or encouragement described.

There appears to be no special measures to enforce adherence, so this domain is very pragmatic.

Follow-up
Score: [4]

Relevant quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Assessments occurred between January 2013 and October 2013.&quot;</span> <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants completed online questionnaires at baseline (prior to randomisation), post-intervention and three-month follow-up.&quot;</span>

Follow-up is at two time points, post-intervention and 3 months. This is more frequent than usual care but not excessive.

Primary Outcome
Score: [4]

Relevant quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The GHQ is designed to measure general levels of distress.&quot;</span> 

The GHQ measures distress which is relevant but not as directly important as concrete outcomes like symptoms or disability.

Primary Analysis
Score: [5] 

Relevant quote: No exclusions stated - seems to be full intention-to-treat.

All participants appear to be included in the primary analysis.</pre>

publication full text</span> (mean similarity 99.8%)</i></p>
<pre>
Here are the PRECIS-2 scores and explanations for each domain based on the provided full text:

Eligibility criteria:

Quotes:
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Inclusion criteria—age > 18, confirmed diagnosis of MS, Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS): 2.0–6.5, Six Spot Step Test (SSST) score > 8 seconds or Timed 25-Foot Walk (T25FW) > 5 seconds, relapse-free within the past 8 weeks, and no adjustment of disease-modifying medication or medication that affects gait performance and spasticity within the past 8 weeks.&quot;</span>

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Exclusion criteria—co-morbidity in terms of cognitive disorders or alcohol abuse (based on clinical judgment), pathologies that did not allow systematic PRT >1 session/week within the last 3 months.&quot;</span>

Score: [3] 

The inclusion criteria target a specific population of MS patients with impaired mobility, which makes it moderately pragmatic. However, the exclusion criteria rule out patients with co-morbidities and those unable to do PRT weekly, making it more restrictive. Overall, it seems equally pragmatic and explanatory.

Recruitment:

Quotes: 
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants were included from September 2016 to October 2018, after being invited via seven MS clinics (specified in “Acknowledgements” section) and targeted advertisements sent out via the Danish MS Society.&quot;</span>

Score: [2]

Participants were recruited through MS clinics but also more broadly through the MS Society, suggesting extra effort beyond just clinic visits. This makes recruitment moderately explanatory.

Setting:

Quotes:
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Written informed consent was obtained. The study was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov (NCT 02870023) and approved by the Regional ethical committee (ID no. 1-10-72-316-15).&quot;</span> 

<span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 97.8%):

ed to provide either PRT or BMCT or to a waitlist CON. Allocation of interventions was done by a cluster randomization conducted whenever three groups could be established at three different participating clinics. After baseline testing (conducted at a university research facility), three concealed envelopes, each containing the name of one intervention (PRT, BMCT, or CON), were randomly drawn, and one intervention was then allocated to each of the three clinics.' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;Allocated to provide either PRT or BMCT or to a waitlist CON. After baseline testing (conducted at a university research facility), three concealed envelopes, each containing the name of one intervention (PRT, BMCT, or CON), were randomly drawn, and one intervention was then allocated to each of the three clinics.&quot;</span>

Score: [4] 

The study took place across multiple clinics and community settings, making it pragmatic. However, baseline testing was done at a research facility, so the setting is moderately pragmatic.

Organization:

Quotes:
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;All training sessions were supervised by physiotherapists who were trained to deliver the intervention.&quot;</span>

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Physiotherapists with experience in providing BMCT managed the programs. The therapists were instructed to aim for a level of difficulty, where the participants experienced failure but still reached successful execution in more than 50% of the attempts/time.&quot;</span>

Score: [4] 

The interventions were delivered by physiotherapists, suggesting usual care resources. However, the therapists received specific training on delivering the interventions. This makes the organization moderately pragmatic.

Flexibility (delivery):

Quotes:
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The exercises progressed from three sets of 10 repetitions at 15 RM toward four sets of 8 repetitions at 8 RM.&quot;</span> 

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The BMCT intervention was developed based on previously published programs, and according to principle of the task-oriented approach, thus addressing salient tasks including sitting (5 minutes), standing (5 minutes), stepping (10 minutes), walking (2 × 10 minutes), and eye-movement training (10 minutes; framework illustrated in Supplemental Appendix).&quot;</span>

Score: [2]

The PRT protocol is highly specified. The BMCT program also follows a structured framework. This prescriptive delivery makes it moderately explanatory.

Flexibility (adherence):

No relevant quotes.

Score: [NA]

Follow-up:

Quotes: 
<span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 99.2%):

follow-up test was performed within 7 days of the last intervention session or after the last day of being on the waitlist.' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;A follow-up test was performed within 7 days of the last intervention session or after the last day of being on the waitlist.&quot;</span>

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;In case of adverse events, these were registered by the treating therapist and reported to the primary investigator.&quot;</span>

Score: [4] 

Follow-up was limited to one post-intervention assessment, suggesting usual care. However, adverse events were closely monitored, making follow-up moderately pragmatic.

Primary outcome:

Quotes:
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Primary outcomes were the T25FW and the SSST.&quot;</span>

Score: [5]

The primary outcomes of gait speed and mobility are highly relevant to MS patients, making this very pragmatic.

Primary analysis:

Quote:
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Analyses were carried out as intention-to-treat, where all participants who completed the baseline assessment were included regardless of their adherence to the allocated intervention.&quot;</span>

Score: [5] 

The intention-to-treat analysis included all randomized participants, which is very pragmatic.</pre>

Here are the PRECIS-2 domain assessments for the provided full text:

Eligibility criteria:

Relevant quotes:
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Inclusion criteria—Clinical diagnosis of MS, as defined by the modified McDonald criteria, with an Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score of 1.0–6.5, and able to walk a 10-metre distance; aged 18–65 years; clinically stable for at least four weeks prior to entering the study; physically able to participate in exercise three times per week; able to provide written informed consent.&quot;</span>

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Exclusion criteria—Comorbid conditions impairing the ability to be physically active three times per week; unwilling to be randomised; living more than 20 miles from the trial centre; already engaged in structured exercise or brisk walking ≥ 3 times per week for ≥ 30 minutes per session for at least six months.&quot;</span>

The eligibility criteria are moderately pragmatic. The inclusion criteria allow a broad range of MS patients to participate, including those with mild to moderate disability per the EDSS score range. The age range is also inclusive. However, the exclusion criteria rule out patients with significant comorbidities, those living far from the trial center, and those already exercising regularly. This may limit the generalizability of the results.

Score: [3]

Recruitment:

Relevant quote: 
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;A total of 120 PwMS were recruited via the Sheffield MS Clinic and flyers/community adverts displayed at the local South Yorkshire MS Society branches.&quot;</span>

The recruitment method is moderately pragmatic. Participants were recruited from an MS clinic, which is a realistic setting, but additional recruitment was done via flyers and adverts, which requires more effort than typical patient recruitment. 

Score: [3] 

Setting:

Relevant quote:
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Supervised exercise sessions involved up to three participants and lasted for approximately one hour. Studies show that aerobic exercise, resistance exercise and combined programmes bring health benefits to PwMS. Hence, the programme was designed to be pragmatic and accessible, taking into account exercise preferences and giving choices.&quot;</span>

The setting is very pragmatic. The exercise sessions took place in a realistic setting and the program was designed to be pragmatic and accessible.

Score: [5]

Organization:

Relevant quote: 
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;An exercise physiologist supervised the delivery of the intervention but with physiotherapist input during the early stages of the programme.&quot;</span>

The organization is moderately pragmatic. Having an exercise physiologist supervise the sessions is realistic, but the additional physiotherapist input early on requires more resources than would be typical.

Score: [3]

Flexibility (delivery):

Relevant quote:
<span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 99.8%):

Aerobic exercise was the core exercise modality as it is accessible (i.e. includes community-based walking exercise) and does not require equipment. Participants were asked to complete short bouts (e.g. 5 × 3 minutes, with twominute rest intervals) of low to moderate intensity aerobic exercise (e.g. stepping ergometer, cycle-ergometer, treadmill walking, rowing ergometer, arm-cranking) at 50%– 69% of predicted maximum heart rate (220–age) or 12–14 on the Borg Ratings of Perceived Exertion Scale.' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;Aerobic exercise was the core exercise modality as it is accessible (i.e. includes community-based walking exercise) and does not require equipment. Participants were asked to complete short bouts (e.g. 5 × 3 minutes, with two-minute rest intervals) of low to moderate intensity aerobic exercise (e.g. stepping ergometer, cycle-ergometer, treadmill walking, rowing ergometer, arm-cranking) at 50%–69% of predicted maximum heart rate (220–age) or 12–14 on the Borg Ratings of Perceived Exertion Scale.&quot;</span> 

The flexibility of delivery is moderately pragmatic. The aerobic exercise component offers flexibility in modality and intensity. However, the protocol does specify duration and intervals, making it more structured than typical exercise.

Score: [3]

Flexibility (adherence): 

Relevant quote:
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Home exercise during the intervention period comprised walking, use of home exercise equipment, public facilities (including swimming) and gardening for the majority of participants.&quot;</span>

The flexibility of adherence is very pragmatic. Participants had flexibility in choosing their home exercise activities with minimal intervention to enforce adherence.

Score: [5]

Follow-up:

Relevant quote: 
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Outcomes were assessed at baseline, and at three months (post-intervention) and nine months after randomisation.&quot;</span>

The follow-up is moderately pragmatic. Outcomes were assessed at 3 and 9 months, which provides longer follow-up than typical. However, the assessments were limited to these specific time points rather than intensive ongoing follow-up.

Score: [3]

Primary outcome:

Relevant quote:
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The primary outcome was self-reported exercise behaviour at three months using the Godin Leisure Time Exercise Questionnaire (GLTEQ).&quot;</span>

The primary outcome is very pragmatic. Self-reported exercise behavior is highly relevant and meaningful to participants. 

Score: [5]

Primary analysis:

Relevant quote:
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;All analyses were by intention to treat, whereby participants were analysed in the arm to which they were randomised irrespective of whether they complied with the intervention.&quot;</span> 

The analysis is very pragmatic, using an intention-to-treat approach including all participants as randomized.

<p><i><span style="border-bottom: 1px dashed black;">8 quote(s) from
publication full text</span> (mean similarity 100%)</i></p>
<pre>
Here are the PRECIS-2 domain scores and explanations for the trial:

1. Eligibility criteria

Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Inclusion criteria were: age of 18 years or above; BDI score of at least 14 on two consecutive occasions and no treatment from psychologist, psychotherapist or psychiatrist within the last three months.&quot;</span>

The eligibility criteria are moderately pragmatic as adults with clinically significant depression symptoms are included, regardless of depression diagnosis. However, exclusion of those currently receiving psychological treatment makes it less pragmatic.

Score: [3] 

2. Recruitment 

Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Potential participants who were identified as having severe depression (BDI score of at least 29) or active suicidal ideas during the screening process were contacted by the study clinical psychologists and briefly assessed to understand whether the reported symptoms were typical and advised to contact their GP if deemed necessary.&quot;</span>

Recruitment was done through screening questionnaires sent to patients at clinics, which is moderately pragmatic. However, additional screening by psychologists to confirm eligibility makes recruitment more explanatory.

Score: [3]

3. Setting

Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Invitations were made between October 2008 and July 2009: face-to-face by consultants in the Sheffield Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust MS clinic (n = 288); by the Sheffield MS nurses visiting patients (n = 4); and, using ink-signed personalised letters mailed out from a neuropsychologist at Sheffield (n = 40) as well as from consultant neurologists at the Walton Centre for Neurology and Neurosurgery NHS Trust, Liverpool (n = 250).&quot;</span>

The setting was primary care and outpatient clinics, which is very pragmatic as this is where patients with MS would receive treatment in usual care.

Score: [5] 

4. Organization

Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;In the Liverpool region, a specialist neuropsychologist, based in the acute hospital facilitated access to and provided technical advice on CCBT, but did not provide additional therapeutic input. No provision other than home-use was offered or sought.&quot;</span>

The organization of care delivery seems very similar to usual care, with no extra staffing or resources.

Score: [5]

5. Flexibility: delivery

Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Only one out of the five participating PCTs around the Sheffield centre formally provided any kind of community facility for accessing CCBT; PCT staff warned that clients rarely used the facility and it was closed during the course of the study.&quot;</span>

The delivery of CCBT was flexible and done at home, which is very pragmatic.

Score: [5]

6. Flexibility: adherence

No relevant quotes. The paper does not mention any special measures to enforce adherence.

Score: [NA]

7. Follow-up

Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The collection of outcome data by postal questionnaire proved to be challenging, with multiple attempts to obtain data from many participants, particularly at later outcome assessment points.&quot;</span>

Follow-up was done via postal questionnaires, which required more intensive effort than usual care. This makes follow-up more explanatory.

Score: [2]

8. Primary outcome  

Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants expressed concern about the face validity, for people with MS, of the questionnaires used for the measurement of self-reported depression, including the Beck Depression Inventory II.&quot;</span>

The primary outcome of depression symptoms on BDI-II is patient-important but may lack face validity for MS patients.

Score: [3] 

9. Primary analysis

Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Primary analysis was an Intention To Treat (ITT) analysis which analysed all 24 participants according to their randomised treatment assignment ignoring non compliance, protocol deviations and withdrawal.&quot;</span>

The primary analysis was full ITT, which is very pragmatic.

Score: [5]</pre>

<pre>
Here are the PRECIS-2 domain scores and explanations for the clinical trial text provided:

1. Eligibility criteria 

Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Key inclusion criteria permitted the participation of men or women ≥18 years of age with confirmed and documented RRMS diagnosis (as defined by the Revised McDonald criteria), Kurtzke Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score of 0 to 5.5 at the screening visit, and, 30 days prior to randomization, a stable neurological condition, relapse-free status, and no use of any corticosteroid or adrenocorticotropic hormone treatment.&quot;</span>

The eligibility criteria are fairly broad, including adult men and women with confirmed RRMS diagnosis and stable disease in the past 30 days. The criteria seem reasonably similar to patients who would receive this treatment in usual care.

Score: [4] Rather pragmatic

2. Recruitment

Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Eligible patients were randomly assigned 1:1 to receive subcutaneous injections of GA40 (n = 431) or GA20 (n = 430).&quot;</span> 

Patients were recruited at 88 study centers in 14 countries. No details are provided on how patients were identified and recruited at each site. 

Score: [3] Equally pragmatic and explanatory 

3. Setting

Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The CONFIDENCE study was a multinational, multicenter, randomized, parallel-group, phase 4, open-label study conducted at 88 study centers in 14 countries (Russia, Poland, Italy, France, Croatia, US [including Puerto Rico], Mexico, Spain, Austria, Turkey, Belgium, Argentina, Germany, and Finland) across different geographic regions.&quot;</span>

The study was conducted across a range of geographic regions and practice settings, reasonably reflecting real-world settings. 

Score: [4] Rather pragmatic

4. Organization

No details are provided on resources or expertise required to deliver the interventions beyond the study centers and staff.

Score: [3] Equally pragmatic and explanatory

5. Flexibility: Delivery

No details are provided on flexibility in how the interventions were delivered.

Score: [3] Equally pragmatic and explanatory 

6. Flexibility: Adherence

No details are provided on measures to ensure adherence.

Score: [3] Equally pragmatic and explanatory

7. Follow-up

Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Five scheduled visits at study sites occurred at screening (within 2 weeks prior to baseline), baseline (Month 0), and Months 1, 3, and 6 (end of the core phase).&quot;</span>

Follow-up intensity seems reasonably similar to what would occur in usual care.

Score: [4] Rather pragmatic

8. Primary outcome  

Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The primary endpoint was patient overall satisfaction with the medication as measured by the single-item MSQ 7-point scale (1 = extremely dissatisfied to 7 = extremely satisfied)&quot;</span>

The primary outcome is directly relevant to patients.

Score: [5] Very pragmatic

9. Primary analysis

Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis set included all randomly assigned participants and were analyzed according to the treatment group to which they were randomly assigned, regardless of which treatment they actually received.&quot;</span>

An intention-to-treat analysis was used including all randomized patients.

Score: [5] Very pragmatic</pre>

<p><i><span style="border-bottom: 1px dashed black;">8 quote(s) from
publication full text</span> (mean similarity 100%)</i></p>
<pre>
Here are the PRECIS-2 domain scores and explanations for the given trial:

1. Eligibility criteria

Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;To be included, people had to be aged 18 years or more, have a confirmed diagnosis of relapsing–remitting MS, have an Ambulation Index score of 2, 3 or 4 (mild to moderate walking disabilities), and have received medical clearance to participate.&quot;</span>

Score: [3] 

The eligibility criteria are moderately pragmatic. Participants had confirmed relapsing-remitting MS and mild-moderate walking disability, which matches the target population. However, some patients like those with benign or progressive MS were excluded, reducing pragmatism. Overall, a mix of broad inclusion with some exclusions.

2. Recruitment

Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Recruitment information flyers were sent by mail to all potential participants registered on the mailing lists of both organizations. If interested, volunteers were asked to contact one of the researchers (KD) by telephone, during which volunteers were screened to ensure they satisfied the inclusion criteria.&quot;</span>

Score: [4] 

Recruitment was done by mailing information to organizations supporting people with MS. This reaches the target population without extensive advertising or incentives. Fairly pragmatic approach.

3. Setting

Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The experimental group completed a 10-week (two times per week), PRT program in one of four community gymnasiums in metropolitan and regional areas.&quot;</span>

Score: [5] 

The setting of community gymnasiums matches where the intervention would be delivered in usual care. Very pragmatic.

4. Organization

Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Each program was attended by a group of up to 12 participants, and they were supervised by up to three experienced trainers (physiotherapists and registered personal sports trainers).&quot;</span>

Score: [4]

The program was delivered in small groups with trainers. It utilized existing staffing and facilities. Fairly pragmatic organization.

5. Flexibility: delivery

Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The training intensity was based on recommendations of the American College of Sports Medicine (2009) and consisted of two sets of 10–12 repetitions of each exercise, at a training intensity of 10–12 repetition maximum.&quot;</span>

Score: [3] 

The exercise program followed a defined protocol typical for progressive resistance training. Moderately pragmatic flexibility in delivery.

6. Flexibility: adherence

Score: [NA]

No relevant quotes found regarding measures to enforce adherence.

7. Follow-up

Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Outcome measurements were taken three times: at baseline, after 10 weeks to determine the immediate effects of the intervention, and after a further 12 weeks (week 22) to determine if any benefits from the program had been sustained.&quot;</span>

Score: [4] 

Follow-up at 10 and 22 weeks is more than usual care but not excessive. Fairly pragmatic.

8. Primary outcome

Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Changes in walking endurance were measured with the 2-minute walk test (2MWT).&quot;</span> 

Score: [5]

The primary outcome of walking endurance is highly relevant to participants. Very pragmatic.

9. Primary analysis

Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Intention-to-treat analysis was applied, with all participants who were allocated and commenced their program included in analysis. Where data were missing, the carry forward technique was used.&quot;</span>

Score: [5] 

Intention-to-treat analysis with all randomized participants is very pragmatic.</pre>

Here are the PRECIS-2 domain scores and explanations for the given full text:

Eligibility criteria:

Quotes:
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Adults with MS were recruited through announcements at REVAL rehabilitation research institute (UHasselt), Flemish MS rehabilitation centers and MS Society, and Move-to-Sport. Adults diagnosed with MS were included based on the ability to walk 5 km without rest or use of assistive device.&quot;</span>

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Exclusion criteria were reports to have run 5 km in the preceding 6 months or a relapse occurring in the preceding 3 months.&quot;</span>

Explanation: The eligibility criteria are focused on adults with a diagnosis of MS who have the ability to walk 5km without assistance. This aligns with the intended real-world population that would receive this intervention. The exclusions of those who recently ran 5km or had a recent relapse seem reasonable.

Score: [4] Rather pragmatic

Recruitment:

Quote: 
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Interested pwMS attended an information session and jointly walked 5 km for verification of their ability.&quot;</span>

Explanation: Recruitment involved attending an information session and verifying ability by walking 5km jointly. This process does not seem substantially different from how participants might learn about and be recruited for such an intervention in a real-world setting.

Score: [4] Rather pragmatic  

Setting:

Quote:
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants were asked to weekly upload data to allow remote supervision of the training adherence by the research assistant. If a participant had been inactive, a phone call was made for enquiry. Besides, two group training sessions were organized (weeks 4 and 8) at a 400-m outdoor running track at KULeuven.&quot;</span>

Explanation: The setting involved primarily individual training in the community with some group sessions at an outdoor track. This seems reasonably aligned with a real-world setting for delivering this intervention.

Score: [4] Rather pragmatic

Organization:

Quote: 
<span title='Moderate quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 94.6%):

S received training instructions by email. They were asked to train three times weekly according to a personalized training intensity schedule that was based on their baseline aerobic capacity.' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ff9e81'>&quot;Participants received training instructions by email. They were asked to train three times weekly according to a personalized training intensity schedule that was based on their baseline aerobic capacity.&quot;</span>

Explanation: The organization and resources seem very similar to what would be typical in a real-world implementation - personalized instructions via email that participants carry out themselves in the community.

Score: [5] Very pragmatic

Flexibility (delivery):

Quote:
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;An illustration of a training protocol is provided in supplementary material S1. During the first weeks, training consisted of longer walking bouts, interspersed with short 1′ running bouts. The relative amount of running gradually increased until participants were able to run 5 km without interruption at 12 weeks.&quot;</span>

Explanation: There is a protocol and schedule provided to participants, but flexibility in exactly how they complete their prescribed training. This level of flexibility seems reasonable for a real-world program.

Score: [4] Rather pragmatic

Flexibility (adherence):

Quote: 
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants who completed the training program showed high adherence. The EXP group completed 607 of 648 prescribed sessions (94%).&quot;</span>

Explanation: A high level of adherence was achieved, but it does not seem that special measures were taken to enforce this beyond what would be typical in a real-world program.

Score: [5] Very pragmatic

Follow-up:

Quote:
<span title='Moderate quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 93.6%):

atients were tested at two time points (0 and 12 weeks). The EXP group completed a 12-week gradual “start-torun” program in between time points. The WLC group Figure 1. Illustration of the experimental design and methods of training supervision. Multiple Sclerosis Journal 25(1) 94 journals.sagepub.com/home/msj was offered a comparable training program after the final measurements.' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ff9e81'>&quot;Evaluation was performed at two time points (0 and 12 weeks). The EXP group completed a 12-week gradual “start-to-run” program in between time points. The WLC group was offered a comparable training program after the final measurements.&quot;</span>

Explanation: Follow-up matches the duration of the intervention with measures at baseline and 12 weeks. This seems very similar to what would occur in a real-world program.

Score: [5] Very pragmatic

Primary outcome:

Quotes:
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The primary outcome measures were physical fitness, walking capacity and perceived ability, functional mobility, and quality of life.&quot;</span>

<span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 99.6%):

Aerobic capacity was assessed on an electronically braked cycle ergometer (eBike Basic ® ; General Electric GmbH, Bitz, Germany) with continuous pulmonary gas exchange analysis (Oxycon, Erich Jaeger GmbH, Germany), and heart rate (HR) monitoring (Polar ®' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;Aerobic capacity was assessed on an electronically braked cycle ergometer (eBike Basic®; General Electric GmbH, Bitz, Germany) with continuous pulmonary gas exchange analysis (Oxycon, Erich Jaeger GmbH, Germany), and heart rate (HR) monitoring (Polar ®).&quot;</span>

Explanation: The primary outcomes of fitness, walking ability, functional mobility, and quality of life are highly relevant for participants. While some specialized equipment was used for measuring aerobic capacity, determining fitness level is still pragmatic.

Score: [4] Rather pragmatic

Primary analysis:

Quote: 
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Intention-to-treat analysis was performed.&quot;</span>

Explanation: An intention-to-treat analysis was stated, which pragmatically includes all randomized participants.

Here are the PRECIS-2 domain scores and explanations for the given full text:

Eligibility criteria:

Relevant quotes: 
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The inclusion criterion for the study was a diagnosis of multiple sclerosis, and therefore the spectrum of clinical presentations was broad, as would be expected in this client population.&quot;</span>

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Clients attending the clinic were interviewed, and their case histories recorded. The research project was explained, and written informed consent was obtained.&quot;</span>

The inclusion criteria reflect usual care, as any MS patient attending the clinic would be eligible. The only exclusion seems to be lack of informed consent. The criteria allow a broad spectrum of MS patients typical of real world practice.

Score: [4] Rather pragmatic

Recruitment:

Relevant quote:  
<span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 95.4%):

clients seen in the multiple sclerosis clinics at Sutherland-Chan School, in which the study was conducted.' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;Clients attending the multiple sclerosis clinics at Sutherland-Chan School, in which the study was conducted.&quot;</span>

Patients were recruited as they attended the MS clinic, reflecting real world practice. No additional efforts were made to recruit patients.

Score: [5] Very pragmatic 

Setting:

Relevant quote:
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants were clients seen in the multiple sclerosis clinics at Sutherland-Chan School, in which the study was conducted.&quot;</span>

The setting was a real world MS clinic where patients receive usual care. This matches the intended setting.

Score: [5] Very pragmatic

Organisation:

Relevant quote: 
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;An appropriate history and physical examination was performed, and a treatment plan determined, this being reflective of the therapist’s assessment and the mutually set goals for the treatment series.&quot;</span>

The organization of care delivery seems very similar to real world practice, with individualized treatment plans based on patient goals. No extra resources or training were provided.

Score: [5] Very pragmatic

Flexibility (delivery):

Relevant quote:
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The teacher also monitored treatment delivery, which involved the application of a variety of techniques appropriate to the client’s needs.&quot;</span>

The delivery of the intervention was flexible and tailored to each patient's needs, as would occur in usual care. There was no strict protocol.

Score: [5] Very pragmatic

Flexibility (adherence): 

No relevant quotes. The study does not mention any measures to enforce or monitor adherence.

Score: [NA] 

Follow-up:

Relevant quote:  
<span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 99.6%):

For both treatment and control groups, self-efficacy scores were obtained before the first treatment, midtreatment series, after the last treatment in the series, four weeks after the final treatment and again eight weeks after the final treatment had been received.' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;For both treatment and control groups, self-efficacy scores were obtained before the first treatment, mid-treatment series, after the last treatment in the series, four weeks after the final treatment and again eight weeks after the final treatment had been received.&quot;</span>

Follow-up was more frequent than usual care to assess outcomes at multiple timepoints.

Score: [2] Rather explanatory

Primary outcome:

Relevant quote:
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The outcome measures for the current research were the scores yielded by the Multiple Sclerosis Self Efficacy (MSSE) survey.&quot;</span> 

The MSSE survey measures self-efficacy, which is relevant and meaningful to MS patients.

Score: [5] Very pragmatic

Primary analysis:

Relevant quote: 
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The data were analyzed on an intention to treat basis, with a focus on the differences between mean MSSE values of the control and intervention groups.&quot;</span>

An intention-to-treat analysis was used, implying all randomized patients were included. 

Score: [5] Very pragmatic

In summary, this pragmatic trial of massage therapy for MS patients scored very pragmatic on most domains, except for more frequent follow-up assessments.</pre>

publication full text</span> (mean similarity 100%)</i></p>
<pre>
Here are the PRECIS-2 domain scores and explanations for the trial described in the full text:

Eligibility criteria 
Relevant quotes:
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Key inclusion criteria were age older than 18 years, a diagnosis of progressive multiple sclerosis (primary or secondary) according to McDonald’s criteria,21 and a score of 6·5–8·0 on the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS).&quot;</span>

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Key exclusion criteria were being within 3 months of ceasing a multiple sclerosis disease modifying drug, receiving steroid treatment within the preceding month, or participating in another clinical trial.&quot;</span>

The eligibility criteria are moderately pragmatic. The inclusion of adults with primary or secondary progressive MS with EDSS scores of 6.5-8.0 captures a relevant patient population for the intervention. However, the exclusion of those who recently ceased disease modifying drugs or steroids makes it less pragmatic. Overall, it strikes a balance between being explanatory and pragmatic. Score: [3]

Recruitment
Relevant quotes: 
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants were recruited through eight health care organisations, including the UK National Health Service (NHS) Trusts, social enterprises, and third sector multiple sclerosis therapy centres, in two regions (Devon–Cornwall and East Anglia) of the UK.&quot;</span>

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Individuals were invited consecutively until the allocated number of standing frames (dependent on commissioning costs) at each health care organisation had been reached.&quot;</span>  

The recruitment is moderately pragmatic. Recruiting consecutive patients from NHS and therapy centers where they would receive usual care is pragmatic. However, limiting recruitment based on number of standing frames makes it less pragmatic. Score: [3]  

Setting
Relevant quotes:
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants were recruited through eight health care organisations, including the UK National Health Service (NHS) Trusts, social enterprises, and third sector multiple sclerosis therapy centres, in two regions (Devon–Cornwall and East Anglia) of the UK.&quot;</span>

The setting is very pragmatic. Conducting the trial in NHS trusts and therapy centers where patients receive usual care makes the setting very applicable to real-world conditions. Score: [5]

Organization 
Relevant quotes:
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The intervention consisted of two home-based physiotherapy sessions (60 min each) to set up the standing frame programme, supported by six follow-up telephone calls (15 min per call).&quot;</span> 

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The use of standing frames is a recognised core skill for UK trained neurological physiotherapists. To standardise and optimise implementation of the intervention, we provided educational materials and assessed fidelity to them.&quot;</span>

The organization is moderately pragmatic. Delivering the intervention with NHS physiotherapists in patients' homes mimics real-world conditions. However, providing additional training materials is less pragmatic. Score: [3]

Flexibility: delivery
Relevant quotes: None relevant.

There is insufficient information to assess flexibility of delivery. Score: [NA] 

Flexibility: adherence
Relevant quotes:
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants were asked to stand in the frame for 30 min three times per week over 20 weeks, and to record the frequency and duration of each stand in a daily diary.&quot;</span>

The flexibility of adherence is moderately pragmatic. Asking participants to stand for a recommended duration mimics a real-world exercise prescription. Allowing self-recording of adherence is also pragmatic. Score: [3]

Follow-up
Relevant quotes:
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Outcome assessments with use of clinician-rated and patient-rated measures at baseline, 20 weeks, and 36 weeks.&quot;</span>

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;All participants were asked to record new symptoms, falls, and medication changes in a daily preformatted diary.&quot;</span> 

The follow-up is moderately pragmatic. Having assessment timepoints at 20 and 36 weeks is more frequent than usual care but not excessive. Self-report diaries are pragmatic but add some extra patient burden. Score: [3]

Primary outcome
Relevant quotes:  
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The primary outcome was motor function as measured by the Amended Motor Club Assessment (AMCA) score at the primary endpoint of 36 weeks post randomisation.&quot;</span>

The primary outcome is very pragmatic. The AMCA score of motor function is highly relevant and meaningful to patients. Score: [5]

Primary analysis
Relevant quotes:
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The primary analysis of the primary outcome, AMCA score at 36 weeks, followed a modified intention to treat approach, regardless of compliance to the intervention, but did exclude patients who were deemed ineligible after randomisation, those who withdrew from the trial and were unwilling for their previously collected data to be used, or those who did not provide baseline and week 36 measurements (ie, there was no imputation of missing baseline or week 36 scores for the primary analysis), and used an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) approach.&quot;</span>

The primary analysis is very pragmatic. Using a modified intention-to-treat approach with no imputation of missing data is a very pragmatic analysis. Score: [5]

In summary, this trial generally has moderate to high pragmatism, with very pragmatic choices for setting, primary outcome, and analysis. The eligibility criteria, recruitment, organization, and follow-up represent a balance between explanatory and pragmatic elements. This aligns with the authors' aim to conduct a pragmatic trial evaluating the effectiveness of a standing frame program under real-world conditions.</pre>

<p><i><span style="border-bottom: 1px dashed black;">7 quote(s) from
publication full text</span> (mean similarity 99.9%)</i></p>
<pre>
Here are the PRECIS-2 domain scores and explanations for the trial described in the full text:

1. Eligibility criteria

Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Eligible participants were over 18 years of age and had a diagnosis of MS that was confirmed by a consultant physician or neurologist.&quot;</span>

Score: [4] Rather pragmatic

The eligibility criteria are fairly broad, including adults over 18 with a diagnosis of MS confirmed by a physician. This is similar to criteria that would be used in usual practice. Some exclusions are made for safety reasons like recent relapse or pregnancy. Overall, the criteria seem intended to include typical MS patients who would receive this intervention in routine care.

2. Recruitment

Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants were referred to the project by themselves, their care-giver, MSI, chartered physiotherapists, neurologists, general practitioners or clinical nurse specialists.&quot;</span> 

Score: [4] Rather pragmatic

Participants were recruited through usual healthcare providers and self-referral, not through extensive advertising or incentives. This matches typical recruitment in routine practice.

3. Setting

Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;All interventions took place in groups of eight, for an hour per week, for 10 weeks. They were delivered in community centres such as local gyms, hotels and health centres.&quot;</span>

Score: [5] Very pragmatic 

The interventions took place in community settings like gyms and health centers, which matches the typical real-world environment where MS patients would receive these interventions as part of routine care.

4. Organization

Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The PT-led exercise provided was pre-defined. It consisted of a circuit-style class of exercises that were either resisted by body weight or by the addition of free weights.&quot;</span>

Score: [3] Equally pragmatic and explanatory

The PT-led intervention was standardized, while the yoga and fitness instructor interventions were not pre-defined. Overall organization seems moderately pragmatic but with some protocolization.

5. Flexibility: Delivery

Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The yoga and FI-led classes were not defined, as this pragmatic trial aimed to establish the effectiveness of and content of these interventions in the manner that people with MS would likely encounter them within the community.&quot;</span>

Score: [4] Rather pragmatic

The yoga and fitness interventions allowed flexibility in delivery, while the PT intervention was more standardized. Overall there was some flexibility in how interventions were delivered.

6. Flexibility: Adherence

No relevant quotes.

Score: [NA] 

Adherence is not discussed.

7. Follow-up

Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Outcome was assessed at week 24 for the intervention groups only, as it was felt that withholding a potentially beneficial treatment for longer than 12 weeks, from the controls, could be considered unethical.&quot;</span>

Score: [3] Equally pragmatic and explanatory

Follow-up was done at 12 and 24 weeks to assess outcomes. This is more frequent than usual care but done for research purposes. Overall moderately pragmatic follow-up.

8. Primary Outcome  

Quote: <span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 99.5%):

The primary outcome measure was the physical component of the Multiple Sclerosis Impact Scale29, version 2 (MSIS-29v2), a patient-reported outcome measure that assesses the physical impact of MS.' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;The primary outcome measure was the physical component of the Multiple Sclerosis Impact Scale-29, version 2 (MSIS-29v2), a patient-reported outcome measure that assesses the physical impact of MS.&quot;</span>

Score: [4] Rather pragmatic

The primary outcome of physical impact is patient-centered and meaningful for MS patients in routine practice.

9. Primary Analysis

No relevant quotes.

Score: [NA] 

Analysis methods are not discussed.</pre>

<pre>
Here are the PRECIS-2 domain scores and explanations for the given clinical trial text:

Eligibility criteria 
Score: [2] Rather explanatory

Relevant quotes: 
<span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Inclusion criteria—Patients with confirmed diagnosis: ≥16 years of age with unilateral facial nerve weakness of no identifiable cause who presented to primary care or an emergency department and could be referred to a collaborating otorhinolaryngologist <72 hours after the onset of symptoms.&quot;</span>
<span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Exclusion criteria—Pregnancy, breast feeding, uncontrolled diabetes, peptic ulcer disease, suppurative otitis media, herpes zoster, multiple sclerosis, systematic infection, sarcoidosis and other rare conditions, and an inability to provide informed consent.&quot;</span>
<span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Extra test—Randomised controlled trial of Bell’s palsy treatment required senior otorhinolaryngologist in hospitals to confirm a patient’s eligibility to participate. Bell’s palsy is usually diagnosed by a general practitioner in primary care.&quot;</span>

Explanation: The eligibility criteria are rather explanatory because there are many exclusions like pregnancy, many medical conditions, inability to consent, and an extra test by a specialist to confirm diagnosis that is not done in usual primary care. The exclusions and extra test make the trial participants less similar to real-world patients.

Recruitment
Score: [NA] No relevant quotes

Explanation: The text does not mention how patients were recruited into the trial.

Setting
Score: [2] Rather explanatory 

Relevant quote: 
<span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Extra test—Randomised controlled trial of Bell’s palsy treatment required senior otorhinolaryngologist in hospitals to confirm a patient’s eligibility to participate. Bell’s palsy is usually diagnosed by a general practitioner in primary care.&quot;</span>

Explanation: The setting is rather explanatory because patients had to be referred to and assessed in a hospital by a specialist, whereas in usual care Bell's palsy is diagnosed and treated in primary care.

Organisation
Score: [NA] 

Explanation: The text does not provide information about resources, expertise, and care delivery organization.

Flexibility: delivery
Score: [NA]

Explanation: The text does not mention flexibility in how the intervention was delivered.

Flexibility: adherence
Score: [NA] 

Explanation: The text does not mention measures to ensure adherence.

Follow-up
Score: [1] Very explanatory

Relevant quote:  
<span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Clinical follow-up until patient left hospital (discharge or death) or until 30 days after surgery, whichever was the longer, so more than usual care.&quot;</span>

Explanation: Follow-up was more extensive than usual care, until 30 days after surgery or hospital discharge. This makes it very explanatory.

Primary outcome
Score: [1] Very explanatory

Relevant quote:
<span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Primary outcome—Recovery of facial function as rated on the House-Brackmann scale.&quot;</span> 

Explanation: The primary outcome uses a scale not routinely used in primary care and requires special training, making it very explanatory.

Primary analysis
Score: [NA]

Explanation: The text does not provide information about the primary analysis.</pre>

Here are the PRECIS-2 assessments for the 9 domains based on the provided full text:

Eligibility criteria:

Relevant quotes:
<span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Inclusion criteria—Patients with confirmed diagnosis: ≥16 years of age with unilateral facial nerve weakness of no identifiable cause who presented to primary care or an emergency department and could be referred to a collaborating otorhinolaryngologist <72 hours after the onset of symptoms.&quot;</span>

<span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Exclusion criteria—Pregnancy, breast feeding, uncontrolled diabetes, peptic ulcer disease, suppurative otitis media, herpes zoster, multiple sclerosis, systematic infection, sarcoidosis and other rare conditions, and an inability to provide informed consent.&quot;</span> 

<span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Extra test—Randomised controlled trial of Bell’s palsy treatment required senior otorhinolaryngologist in hospitals to confirm a patient’s eligibility to participate. Bell’s palsy is usually diagnosed by a general practitioner in primary care.&quot;</span>

The eligibility criteria are quite restrictive, with many exclusions that would not apply in usual care. Confirmation by a specialist otorhinolaryngologist is not typical for Bell's palsy diagnosis. This makes the trial less pragmatic. Score: [2]

Recruitment:

The full text does not provide information on flexibility of intervention delivery. Score: [NA]

Flexibility (adherence):

Relevant quote:  
No relevant quotes found.

The full text does not provide information on measures to ensure adherence. Score: [NA]

Follow-up:

Relevant quote:
<span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Clinical follow-up until patient left hospital (discharge or death) or until 30 days after surgery, whichever was the longer, so more than usual care.&quot;</span>

"Monitoring intensity involved more extensive data collection than usual: 
Pre-operation—three-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) Holter monitor (Flashcard with 2×48 hour recording) set up on each patient and maintained for 72 hours. 
Troponin values at 1, 3, and 7 days after surgery (more usual for only 1 and 3 days after surgery) 
ECG after randomisation and at 7 and 30 days after surgery."

The follow-up period was longer than usual care, and involved more extensive data collection. This makes the trial more explanatory. Score: [1] 

Primary outcome:

Relevant quote: 
<span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Primary outcome—Recovery of facial function as rated on the House-Brackmann scale.&quot;</span> 

<span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Central adjudication—Photographs taken of patients were assessed and graded independently by a panel of three experts (not general practitioners, who usually assess).&quot;</span>

The primary outcome used a scale not routinely used in primary care, and required central adjudication by experts. This makes the trial more explanatory. Score: [1]

Primary analysis:

Here are the PRECIS-2 domain scores and explanations for the given full text:

Eligibility criteria 
Score: [2] Rather explanatory

Relevant quote: <span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Inclusion criteria—Patients with confirmed diagnosis: ≥16 years of age with unilateral facial nerve weakness of no identifiable cause who presented to primary care or an emergency department and could be referred to a collaborating otorhinolaryngologist <72 hours after the onset of symptoms.&quot;</span>

This trial has strict inclusion criteria requiring laboratory confirmation of diagnosis and referral to a specialist, which would not reflect eligibility in usual care where Bell's palsy is often diagnosed clinically by a general practitioner. The age limit and short time window for enrollment also make the sample less representative.

Recruitment
Score: [2] Rather explanatory 

Relevant quote: <span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Initially extra resources were used to recruit patients at 53 primary care practices. Patients were recruited via a postal questionnaire to identify symptoms and trial eligibility, not just to invite to participate.&quot;</span>

Recruitment via postal questionnaire to screen for eligibility is more explanatory than recruiting during routine clinic visits, as it requires additional resources and may bias the sample towards more motivated and adherent participants. 

Setting
Score: [1] Very explanatory

Relevant quote: <span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Single centre and specialised centre (Madigan Army Medical Center, USA), unlikely to be the usual setting for most individuals receiving physiotherapy for shoulder impingement.&quot;</span>

Conducting the trial in a single specialized center reduces generalizability of findings to other settings.

Organization
Score: [3] Equally pragmatic and explanatory

Relevant quote: None provided.

The full text does not provide enough details on organization. Based on the context, it seems to be conducted within the existing healthcare system without major changes.

Flexibility: delivery
Score: [2] Rather explanatory

Relevant quote: <span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Protocol driven—Much detail given, with protocol violations recorded in self reported case form. Investigators accept this may occur due to clinical needs (such as anaesthesia).&quot;</span> 

The protocol is detailed and prescriptive about intervention delivery, though some flexibility is allowed for clinical needs. This reduces flexibility compared to usual care.

Flexibility: adherence 
Score: [5] Very pragmatic

Relevant quote: <span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The sessions were all individual based on interaction with child and allowed for range of responses to the intervention&quot;</span>

No special measures were used to enforce or monitor adherence. Participants were free to engage as in usual care.

Follow-up
Score: [1] Very explanatory

Relevant quote: <span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Clinical follow-up until patient left hospital (discharge or death) or until 30 days after surgery, whichever was the longer, so more than usual care&quot;</span> [...] <span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Unscheduled follow-up visits triggered by primary outcome: a cardiovascular event (such as angina, myocardial infarction, stroke)&quot;</span>

Follow-up was more frequent and intensive than usual care, with additional data collection. Outcome events also triggered extra follow-up.   

Primary outcome
Score: [2] Rather explanatory

Relevant quote: <span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in prompt (Similarity 99.3%):

Primary outcome—Recovery of facial function as rated on the House-Brackmann scale. • Test not routinely used in primary care and requires training' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;Primary outcome—Recovery of facial function as rated on the House-Brackmann scale.

publication full text</span> (mean similarity 99.3%)</i></p>
<pre>
Here are the PRECIS-2 domain scores and explanations for the trial:

1. Eligibility criteria 

Score: [2] Rather explanatory

Relevant quotes:
<span title='Moderate quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 90.7%):

Inclusion criteria were patients in South East London, living with MS and deemed (by clinicians) to have one or more of unresolved symptoms, psychosocial concerns, end-of-life issues, progressive illness, or complex needs (i.e., palliative care needs).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ff9e81'>&quot;Inclusion criteria were patients in South East London who were severely affected by MS and deemed (by clinicians) to have one or more of unresolved symptoms, psychosocial concerns, end-of-life issues, progressive illness, or complex needs (i.e., palliative care needs).&quot;</span>

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Exclusion criteria included if the referring staff or the screening deemed patients had very urgent needs or were deteriorating rapidly when immediate referral to the service was offered.&quot;</span>

The eligibility criteria are rather explanatory because patients were selected based on having palliative care needs as deemed by clinicians, indicating some subjectivity. Patients with very urgent needs were excluded, further limiting the participants to a narrower population. The criteria do not appear to match usual care eligibility.

2. Recruitment

Score: [3] Equally pragmatic and explanatory 

Relevant quotes: 
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Educational seminars informed local health and social care professionals about the PCT.&quot;</span>

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Reasons for drop out, no interview, and refusal were recorded whenever possible.&quot;</span>

The recruitment methods are not described in detail, but educational seminars were used to inform professionals who could refer patients, indicating some extra effort beyond usual care referrals. However, reasons for dropout were recorded, suggesting an intention to recruit typical patients. Overall the recruitment seems balanced between pragmatic and explanatory.

3. Setting

Score: [4] Rather pragmatic

Relevant quote:
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Patients in South East London, living with MS and deemed (by clinicians) to have one or more of unresolved symptoms, psychosocial concerns, end-of-life issues, progressive illness, or complex needs (i.e., palliative care needs).&quot;</span>

The setting of South East London and recruitment from the existing population of MS patients makes the setting rather pragmatic. It matches the intended real-world setting.

4. Organization

Score: [4] Rather pragmatic  

Relevant quotes:
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;In addition to continuing to receive usual services (see below), patients in the fast-track group received care from a PCT. This comprised one part-time consultant in palliative medicine, one part-time clinical nurse specialist, one administrator, and one psychosocial worker, and was based in a large teaching hospital.&quot;</span>

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;If patients were randomized to the fast track, their information was passed to the PCT, which contacted them within 48 hours. If patients were in the control arm, the researcher held their data until after the third research interview at 12 weeks.&quot;</span>


The palliative care team delivers the intervention using existing staffing and resources. Patients continue to receive usual care services alongside the PCT. This makes the organization rather pragmatic as it does not differ much from usual care.

5. Flexibility: delivery

Score: [4] Rather pragmatic

Relevant quote: 
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Patients had one to three contacts (visits and/or phone calls) from the PCT, although a small number (around 12%) were referred for longer-term ‘‘community’’ palliative care.&quot;</span>

The palliative care intervention is delivered with flexibility, with patients receiving 1-3 contacts on average. There is no strict protocol described. This flexibility matches usual care.

6. Flexibility: adherence

Score: [5] Very pragmatic

No relevant quotes.

The text does not mention any measures to enforce or monitor adherence. As a palliative care intervention, adherence measures are likely minimal as in usual care.

7. Follow-up

Score: [2] Rather explanatory

Relevant quotes:
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;We conducted face-to-face interviews with patients and gave self-complete questionnaires to caregivers. At baseline, we collected demographic and clinical data, and the patient’s functional status (both self-report, using the United Kingdom Neurological Disability Scale [UNDS] and interviewer-assessed using the Expanded Disability Status Scale [EDSS], administered by a consultant neurologist [E. S.]). We collected outcome and cost data at baseline (before randomization) and at 6, 12, 18 (only control groupdafter they received PCT), and 24 weeks.&quot;</span>

<span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 99.7%):

Our standardized questionnaires included the Palliative Care Outcome Scale (POS8), 24,25 comprising eight questions on anxiety, patient and carer concerns, and practical needs, each rated 0e4; a single-item POS pain score (rated 0 [best] to 4 [worst]); and caregivers’ burden (using the 12-item version of the Zarit Carer Burden Inventory [ZBI]).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;Our standardized questionnaires included the Palliative Care Outcome Scale (POS-8), comprising eight questions on anxiety, patient and carer concerns, and practical needs, each rated 0e4; a single-item POS pain score (rated 0 [best] to 4 [worst]); and caregivers’ burden (using the 12-item version of the Zarit Carer Burden Inventory [ZBI]).&quot;</span>

The follow-up is rather explanatory, with multiple detailed assessments at baseline and multiple time points using questionnaires and scales not typically used in usual care.

8. Primary outcome

Score: [2] Rather explanatory

Relevant quotes:
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;At 12 weeks, caregiver burden was 4.47 points lower (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.05e7.89) in the fast track compared to the control group.&quot;</span> 

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;There was a trend toward a reduction in pain in the fast-track group and an increase in the control group (with an effect size of 0.6 and a total sample size required to detect this is 56).&quot;</span>

The primary outcomes of caregiver burden (ZBI scale) and pain (POS scale) are measured with research scales not used in usual care. The time point of 12 weeks is also earlier than typical.

9. Primary analysis

Score: [5] Very pragmatic

Relevant quote:
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;We planned an intention-to-treat analysis, irrespective of whether patients were assessed as having palliative care needs or the nature of contact with the PCT.&quot;</span>

The intention-to-treat analysis is very pragmatic, including all randomized patients regardless of adherence.</pre>

publication full text</span> (mean similarity 98.9%)</i></p>
<pre>
Here are the PRECIS-2 domain scores and explanations for the given clinical trial text:

1. Eligibility criteria 

Quotes:
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Eligibility criteria for patients: diagnosis RRMS since at least one year, EDSS score ≤4.0, no symptoms suggestive of a relapse, no relapse in the preceding four weeks, willing and capable of participating in the investigations, and having access to the internet for performing the web-based assessments.&quot;</span>

<span title='Moderate quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 92%):

was not confirmed by a neurologist. The criterion of EDSS �4.0 was checked by assessing whether the patient was self-sufficient and able to walk �500 meters without aid or rest [11].' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ff9e81'>&quot;The MS diagnosis was not confirmed by a neurologist. The criterion of EDSS ≤4.0 was checked by assessing whether the patient was self-sufficient and able to walk ≥500 meters without aid or rest [11].&quot;</span>

The eligibility criteria are reasonably broad, including RRMS patients with low disability (EDSS ≤4.0) who are 1 year post-diagnosis. The diagnosis was made based on self-report rather than neurologist confirmation. The EDSS score was verified by assessing walking ability. Some patients with higher disease activity may have been excluded due to the no relapse criteria. Overall, the criteria seem moderately pragmatic.

Score: [3]

2. Recruitment

Quote: 
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants were recruited from all over the Netherlands by the patient organisation NMSF, Rotterdam, the Netherlands. Interested patients were contacted by a registered nurse experienced in MS (MH) by phone to check diagnosis and eligibility criteria.&quot;</span>

Patients were recruited nationwide in the Netherlands through an MS patient organization. Eligibility was verified by phone, but no other special efforts were mentioned. Recruitment through usual channels by an MS organization seems reasonably pragmatic.

Score: [4] 

3. Setting

Quote:
<span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 97.8%):

CDT was given during three consecutive days in Zorghotel Spelderholt, Beekbergen, the Netherlands, a facility especially equipped for the accommodation of people with impaired health.' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;CDTs were given during three consecutive days in Zorghotel Spelderholt, Beekbergen, the Netherlands, a facility especially equipped for the accommodation of people with impaired health.&quot;</span>

The intervention took place at a specialized facility for people with impaired health. This suggests a more explanatory setting compared to usual care.

Score: [2]

4. Organization

Quote: 
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The multidisciplinary team included a psychiatrist, psychiatric nurse, neurologist, registered nurse specialized in MS, physiotherapist, dance therapist, and a person with MS [9].&quot;</span>

The intervention involved a specialized multidisciplinary team. This level of expertise and resources would not be typical in usual care.

Score: [2]

5. Flexibility: Delivery

Relevant quotes could not be identified. The paper mentions <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;CDT's components&quot;</span> but does not provide specifics on flexibility in delivery.

Score: [NA]

6. Flexibility: Adherence

Relevant quotes could not be identified. The paper does not discuss measures to enforce adherence.

Score: [NA] 

7. Follow-up

Quote:
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Assessments were at baseline and at one, three and six months follow-up via online questionnaires (www.ms4ri.nl).&quot;</span>

Follow-up assessments were performed at 1, 3, and 6 months post-intervention. This seems moderately pragmatic as some follow-up would occur in usual practice but may not be as frequent.

Score: [3]

8. Primary Outcome  

Quote: 
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The primary study outcome was the change in control self-efficacy, assessed by the Multiple Sclerosis Self-Efficacy Scale (MSSES), at six months [12].&quot;</span>

The primary outcome was change in self-efficacy, measured by the MSSES scale. This patient-centered outcome is pragmatic.

Score: [5]

9. Primary Analysis

Quote:
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;All endpoints were analyzed according to the intention-to-treat principle using an ANCOVA with the 6-month value as dependent variable, and condition, baseline value, disease duration and gender as independent variables.&quot;</span>

An intention-to-treat analysis was used, which is pragmatic.

<pre>
Here are the PRECIS-2 domain assessments for the given full text:

Eligibility criteria:

Relevant quotes:
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Inclusion criteria were: 1) having a definite diagnosis of MS from a neurologist; 2) being within 5 years of receiving a diagnosis of MS; 3) scoring at least 10 on the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II); 4) not currently undertaking other psychological treatment for depressive or anxiety symptoms for the length of participation in the current trial; 5) speak English fluently; 6) no current or lifetime diagnosis of psychosis; 7) no current substance dependency; 8) no gross cognitive impairment; and 9) no changes to medications prior and during involvement in the trial.&quot;</span>

The eligibility criteria are quite restrictive, excluding those with psychosis, substance dependency, cognitive impairment, and those already receiving psychological treatment. The criteria seem aimed at selecting participants likely to respond well and adhere to the intervention. The BDI-II cutoff also selects those with at least mild depression. Overall, this results in a participant sample less representative of the wider MS population who would receive this intervention in usual care.

Score: [2]

Recruitment:

Relevant quotes: 
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants were recruited through neurologists working in a large MS outpatient clinic at the hospital, advertisements on MS related websites and local press releases.&quot;</span>

The recruitment methods go beyond typical referral at a MS clinic. Additional effort is made through website/press advertising. This results in a sample less representative of the clinic population.

Score: [2] 

Setting:

Relevant quotes:
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The study took place at a large teaching and research hospital in Melbourne, Australia. Participants were recruited through neurologists working in a large MS outpatient clinic at the hospital.&quot;</span>

The single-center hospital setting is more specialized than the typical setting where patients receive MS care. This reduces generalizability.

Score: [2]

Organization:

Relevant quotes:
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;A senior clinical psychologist and a provisional clinical psychologist (supervised by the clinical psychologist) provided the intervention.&quot;</span>

The intervention is delivered by clinical psychologists with expertise in CBT. This level of provider expertise may not be available in typical MS care.

Score: [3]

Flexibility (delivery):

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The CBT intervention consisted of 8 individual modules which focused on CBT based principles and strategies. These strategies included progressive muscle relaxation, controlled breathing exercises, pleasant activity scheduling, problem solving skills, cognitive exercises which helped individuals identify, challenge and manage unhelpful thoughts and beliefs. For the intervention, a therapy manual was developed by the first author, which included tailored modules and skills for MS patients.&quot;</span>

The intervention follows a manualized protocol over 8 sessions. This reduces flexibility in delivery compared to typical psychological care.

publication full text</span> (mean similarity 99.8%)</i></p>
<pre>
Here are the PRECIS-2 domain scores and explanations for the given clinical trial:

1. Eligibility criteria 

Score: [3]

Relevant quotes:
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants had a confirmed diagnosis of multiple sclerosis, an Extended Disability Status Scale score of 5 (ambulatory without aid or rest for about 200 m) to 6.5 (constant bilateral assistance required to walk about 20 m without resting), stable rehabilitation and drug therapy for 30 days before entry into the study, cognitive scores of over 24 on the Mini-Mental State Examination, and access to the intervention sites using their own or public transport.&quot;</span>

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Potential participants were excluded if they had experienced exacerbation of their multiple sclerosis symptoms three months prior to the study, or had any medical condition which may preclude them from taking part in the exercise intervention.&quot;</span>

The eligibility criteria are moderately pragmatic. Participants had confirmed MS diagnosis and a certain level of disability based on the EDSS score. However, they excluded those with recent exacerbations and other medical conditions, which limits the participants to a narrower population than would receive the intervention in usual care. The cognitive screening and requirement to access the intervention sites make it more explanatory. Overall, it is a mix of pragmatic and explanatory elements.

2. Recruitment

Score: [4] 

Relevant quote: 
<span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 98.4%):

the clinical register for multiple sclerosis 159 patients were deemed suitable for the study. These people were sent invitation letters and participant information sheets. Forty-three potential participants expressed an interest in participating.' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;From the clinical register for multiple sclerosis 159 patients were deemed suitable for the study. These people were sent invitation letters and participant information sheets. Forty-three potential participants expressed an interest in participating.&quot;</span>

The participants were recruited from a clinical register, so they represent the target population. Invitation letters were used, which requires some additional effort, but is still reasonably pragmatic for recruiting patients with this condition.

3. Setting

Score: [5] 

Relevant quote:
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The intervention took place at two different geographical locations (Site A and Site B).&quot;</span>

The setting was two community leisure centers, which matches the intended real-world setting for delivery of this exercise intervention.

4. Organization

Score: [4]

Relevant quotes:  

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Each group was led by two instructors (one physiotherapist and one fitness instructor).&quot;</span>

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The same physiotherapist was present at both sites; however fitness instructors were different between sites.&quot;</span>

The organization is moderately pragmatic. It utilizes a physiotherapist and fitness instructor, which provides some expert oversight, but doesn't require extensive additional resources beyond what would be typical for this intervention. Having two sites and consistent personnel across sites enhances applicability.

5. Flexibility: delivery

Score: [5] 

Relevant quotes:

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Through discussion with the instructors, participants chose which level of each exercise they deemed appropriate and also when and how each exercise should be progressed.&quot;</span> 

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants worked at a self-regulated pace for each exercise.&quot;</span>

The delivery of the intervention was very flexible, leaving many details up to the providers and participants to determine based on their needs and preferences. This matches usual care.

6. Flexibility: adherence

Score: [5]

Relevant quote: 

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Attendance of participants at each class was recorded.&quot;</span>

There is no mention of specific measures to enforce or monitor adherence. Participants' attendance was recorded but they did not seem to face consequences for non-attendance. This matches the flexibility expected in usual care.

7. Follow-up

Score: [2]

Relevant quotes:

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Outcome measures were carried out within the local hospital’s rehabilitation unit. They were taken at baseline, after 8 and 12 weeks of the intervention period (i.e. either the exercise class or usual care).&quot;</span>

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;To counteract the potential effects of fatigue, three versions of the assessment protocol were used, with tests carried out in different orders.&quot;</span>

The follow-up is rather explanatory, with outcomes assessed at the hospital at multiple fixed time points, using an assessor blinded to group allocation. The different assessment versions to counter fatigue also indicates more intensive measurement than usual care.

8. Primary outcome

Score: [4] 

Relevant quotes:

<span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 99.6%):

The Timed 25Foot Walk Test measures walking speed over a short distance and has shown good reliability and validity in the multiple sclerosis population as an individual component of the Multiple Sclerosis Functional Composite disability assessment.' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;The Timed 25-Foot Walk Test measures walking speed over a short distance and has shown good reliability and validity in the multiple sclerosis population as an individual component of the Multiple Sclerosis Functional Composite disability assessment.&quot;</span>

The primary outcome of walking speed is clinically meaningful to participants. While the specific test used requires training and resources, walking speed aligns with patient priorities.

9. Primary analysis

Score: [5] 

Relevant quote:

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;All outcome measures were analysed on the basis of intention to treat, with all variables summarized and comparisons made between groups and over time.&quot;</span>

The analysis was intention-to-treat, including all randomized participants. This is very pragmatic.</pre>

Here are the PRECIS-2 domain scores and explanations for the trial:

Eligibility criteria:
Quotes:
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Ambulatory and sedentary.&quot;</span>
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Inclusion criteria were (1) ambulatory (can walk 100 m, be capable of walking 100 metres without a walking aid corresponding to a classification of ≤5.5 on the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS), even if they do use an aid for daily activities; and (2) self-reported to be sedentary or irregularly active at time of study entry (i.e. do not exercise 30 minutes or more twice per week of moderate to vigorous activity).&quot;</span>  
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Excluded were people who were (1) unable to speak and read English or French; (2) unable to respond to simple questions on orientation and memory; (3) have an additional illness that restricts their function; and/or (4) experienced a relapse during the past 30 days as this may affect physical activity/exercise participation.&quot;</span>

Explanation: The eligibility criteria are moderately pragmatic as they aim to include ambulatory and sedentary patients typical of those who would receive exercise interventions in usual care. However, they exclude those with cognitive impairments, additional illnesses, and recent relapses which reduces pragmatism. Overall, a moderately pragmatic approach.

Score: [3]

Recruitment:
Quotes:  
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;People were recruited from four multiple sclerosis clinics in three Canadian cities and from posting on media sites.&quot;</span>
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Those contacting the research team directly were assessed for eligibility over the phone and sent information on the study electronically. For those eligible, a visit was scheduled to explain study procedures, obtain consent, and carry out the assessment.&quot;</span>

Explanation: Recruitment is moderately pragmatic - participants were identified from MS clinics, which is similar to usual care. However, additional recruitment through media and online posting makes it more explanatory. Overall, a mix of clinic recruitment and more intensive methods.

Score: [3]

Explanation: The setting is multiple sclerosis clinics, which matches the usual care setting where exercise interventions would normally be delivered. Recruiting from multiple clinics enhances pragmatism.

Score: [4]

Organization:
Quotes:
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants in both groups received two private training sessions with the physical therapist or exercise therapist.&quot;</span>

Explanation: Organization is moderately pragmatic. Participants received an initial training session to learn the exercises, similar to what would occur in usual care. No mention of requiring extra staffing or resources. However, the training sessions were provided by study staff, rather than usual care providers. Overall, generally matches usual care.

Score: [3]

Flexibility (delivery):
Quotes: 
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;MSTEP©, a personally adapted exercise regimen including a variety of exercises targeting endurance, muscular, and core strength, balance, flexibility, muscular power, and speed of movement.&quot;</span>
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The goal of the MSTEP© programme is to promote regular bouts of activity most days per week, encouraging a balance between rest and activity, and taking into consideration the physical and emotional status and capacity of the person.&quot;</span>

Explanation: Flexibility of delivery is very pragmatic. The MSTEP intervention allows for personal tailoring and adaptation of the exercise regimen based on the individual's needs and capacity. There is flexibility in the types of exercises, frequency, and intensity. Matches flexibility seen in usual care.

Score: [5] 

Flexibility (adherence):
No relevant quotes.

Explanation: The text does not mention any specific strategies to enforce or monitor adherence. Likely matches the flexibility seen in usual care.

Score: [NA]

Follow-up:
Quotes:

Explanation: Follow-up is moderately pragmatic. Participants completed outcome assessments at baseline, 3, 6, and 12 months. The outcomes assessed are clinically meaningful. Frequency of follow-up is greater than usual care but likely needed to capture study outcomes.

Score: [3]

Primary outcome:
Quotes:
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Primary outcome was peak oxygen consumption (VO2peak) at 12 months&quot;</span>

Explanation: The primary outcome is moderately pragmatic. VO2peak is a clinically meaningful measure of exercise capacity. However, it requires exercise testing equipment not routinely used in usual care.

Eligibility criteria:

Relevant quotes:

<span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 98.1%):

Subjects had a definite diagnosis of primary or secondary progressive MS, and an EDSS of between 6.5 (constant bilateral assistance required to walk about 20 metres without resting) to 8 (essentially restricted to bed or chair or perambulated in wheelchair, but may be out of bed much of the day, retains many selfcare functions and generally has effective use of' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;Subjects had a definite diagnosis of primary or secondary progressive MS, and an EDSS of between 6.5 (constant bilateral assistance required to walk about 20 metres without resting) to 8 (essentially restricted to bed or chair or perambulated in wheelchair, but may be out of bed much of the day, retains many self-care functions and generally has effective use of arms).&quot;</span>

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;People with MS who were medically stable were selected where cognitive function was adequate, as assessed by a Mini Mental State Examination score of 23 or over and had at least three identifiable physiotherapy goals were included.&quot;</span> 

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Potential subjects were excluded if they had rapidly progressing disease, were already involved in a physiotherapy programme, had additional neurological conditions or other medical conditions which would preclude them taking part in the study.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The eligibility criteria are quite restrictive, excluding those with additional conditions, already receiving physiotherapy, rapidly progressing disease, and poor cognition. The EDSS range is narrow. This suggests the trial is aiming for a specific MS population rather than being highly inclusive as in usual care.

Score: [2]

Recruitment:

Relevant quote: 

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;People moderately to severely affected by MS were recruited from the MS Service, NHS Ayrshire and Arran.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: Participants were recruited from a single MS service rather than multiple settings like primary care where MS patients might first present. This suggests more effort than usual care to identify and recruit participants. 

Score: [2] 

Setting:

Relevant quote:

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Subjects assigned to Group 1 received physiotherapy, twice weekly for eight weeks, by an experienced domiciliary physiotherapist within their home.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The intervention was delivered in the patients' own homes. This matches the usual care setting where moderately to severely disabled MS patients would receive physiotherapy.

Score: [5]

Organization:

Relevant quote: 

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Each session lasted up to 60 minutes, and a task-specific programme included upper and lower limb strengthening using theraband, mobile pedals, and weights. Repetition of tasks such as sit to stand, gait, balance (using gym balls and sit fits) and stretching activities were used depending on the subjects previously identified goals.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The physiotherapy sessions were delivered by an experienced physiotherapist using typical equipment like therabands. No mention of additional training or resources. This matches usual organization.

Score: [4]

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Each subject therefore received core treatments aimed to maximize strength, flexibility and function.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The intervention involved core standardized treatments rather than being flexible or tailored. This reduces flexibility compared to usual physiotherapy care.

Score: [2]

Flexibility (adherence): 

Score: [NA]

Follow-up:

Relevant quotes:

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Subjects in both groups were assessed at the beginning and at the end of the eight-week intervention period (i.e. either physiotherapy or control) and then again eight weeks later.&quot;</span>

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;To improve the reliability of the data, all assessments were undertaken at the Douglas Grant Rehabilitation Centre, Irvine, and the assessor remained blind to the subjects’ treatment group allocation.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: Follow-up assessments were done at the research center at fixed timepoints, rather than following usual care. The assessor was blinded. This is more intensive follow-up than typical for MS patients.

Score: [2]

Primary outcome: 

Relevant quote:

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The MS impact scale (MSIS 29), which is a measure of the physical and psychological impact of MS, was the primary outcome measure for the study.&quot;</span> 

Reasoning: The MSIS-29 measures outcomes directly relevant to MS patients' health and quality of life.

Score: [5]

Primary analysis:

Relevant quote:

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;In total 222 of the possible 240 physiotherapy sessions were delivered. The average number of sessions received by participants was 14.8 (out of a possible 16).&quot;</span>

Reasoning: No details provided on primary analysis. The high adherence rate suggests an intention-to-treat approach would include most participants.

Here are the PRECIS-2 domain assessments for the clinical trial described in the full text:

Eligibility criteria

Quotes:
<span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 98.5%):

The only selection criterion was that the diagnosis of MS was con rmed by the general practitioner. There were no exclusion criteria.' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;The only selection criterion was that the diagnosis of MS was confirmed by the general practitioner. There were no exclusion criteria.&quot;</span>

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants were volunteers with MS who were recruited through voluntary organizations, were community based and lived in West London and in counties contiguous with Greater London.&quot;</span>

The eligibility criteria were very inclusive, with the only requirement being a confirmed MS diagnosis. Volunteers were recruited from the community rather than specialist clinics. This matches how patients would access care for MS in the real world.

Score: [5] Very pragmatic

Recruitment

Quote: 
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants were volunteers with MS who were recruited through voluntary organizations, were community based and lived in West London and in counties contiguous with Greater London.&quot;</span>

Participants were recruited through voluntary organizations rather than actively identified and recruited. This is similar to how patients would access care on their own in the real world.

Score: [4] Rather pragmatic 

Setting

Quote:
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;It was a community-based research study, which was approved by the appropriate local research ethics committees, and was conducted at the Centre for Research in Rehabilitation at Brunel University’s Osterley Campus in West London from June 1996 until February 1999.&quot;</span>

The study was conducted in the community rather than a specialized clinic setting. This matches the real-world setting where MS care takes place.

Score: [5] Very pragmatic

Organization

Quote: 
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The intervention comprised discussion of self-care based on client priorities, using an information booklet about self-care.&quot;</span>

The intervention relied on existing healthcare staff and resources available in the community. No additional training, staffing, or resources were provided. This matches real-world care.

Score: [5] Very pragmatic

Flexibility: Delivery

Quote:
<span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 98.4%):

As  ndings from the Delphi study highlighted the need for  exibility and responsiveness to individuals the format of the discussion focused on individuals’ interests and concerns rather than on covering all the information contained in the booklet.' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;As findings from the Delphi study highlighted the need for flexibility and responsiveness to individuals the format of the discussion focused on individuals’ interests and concerns rather than on covering all the information contained in the booklet.&quot;</span>

The delivery of the intervention was flexible and tailored to each participant's priorities and needs. This matches real-world care.

Score: [5] Very pragmatic

Flexibility: Adherence

No relevant quotes. The study does not mention any special measures to enforce or monitor adherence. This suggests a pragmatic approach similar to real-world care.

Score: [5] Very pragmatic

Follow-up

Quote: 
<span title='Moderate quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 85.7%):

assessments were conducted six months after baseline.' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ff9e81'>&quot;Follow-up assessments were conducted six months after baseline.&quot;</span>

A single follow-up assessment was done. No additional unscheduled visits or extensive data collection is mentioned. This matches typical real-world follow-up.

Score: [4] Rather pragmatic

Primary Outcome

Quote:
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Total scores on a postal version of the Barthel Index, a scale measuring mobility, the SF-36, and one measure developed for the study; the Standard Day Dependency Record (SDDR), were the main outcome measures.&quot;</span>

The outcomes of mobility, quality of life, and independence are highly relevant for MS patients. The measures used are common in real-world practice.

Score: [5] Very pragmatic

Primary Analysis

No relevant quotes. The study does not mention excluding any participants or data from the analysis. This suggests an intention-to-treat approach, which is pragmatic.

Here are the PRECIS-2 domain scores and explanations for the given clinical trial text:

1. Eligibility criteria

Quote: <span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 98.7%):

2012. Inclusion criteria were: having MS (MacDonald criteria); being able to complete a questionnaire; and being in need for a multidisciplinary approach, defined by the requirement, in addition to the neurology specialist, of at least two different medical (rehabilitation specialist, neurourology specialist, psychiatrist) or allied health professionals (physiotherapist, occupational therapist, social worker, psychologist, and neuropsychologist).

Patients who were not living independently in the community were excluded.&quot;</span>

The eligibility criteria are moderately pragmatic as patients with MS who would need a multidisciplinary approach in usual care are included. However, some patients like those not living independently who may benefit from the intervention are excluded.

Score: [3] 

2. Recruitment

Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Signed informed consent was obtained for each patient at inclusion.&quot;</span>

No details are provided on how patients were recruited, so it's unclear how pragmatic this domain is.

Score: [NA]

3. Setting

Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;This is a prospective, randomized, controlled, monocentric clinical trial in MS patients.&quot;</span>

The trial is conducted at a single center, which makes it more explanatory.

Score: [2]

4. Organization

Quote: <span title='Moderate quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 81.5%):

These patients received a half-day (four to six hours) individually tailored assessment by the multidisciplinary' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ff9e81'>&quot;Patients in the IMD group received a half-day (four to six hours) individually tailored assessment by the multidisciplinary group.&quot;</span> 

The organization of care delivery seems very similar to usual care.

Score: [4]

5. Flexibility: Delivery

Quote: <span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 97.5%):

re 1). For patients in the IMD group, the multidisciplinary integrated outpatient clinic was planned at our MS clinic within a maximum three-month period after inclusion.

These patients received a half-day (four to six hours) individually tailored assessment by the multidisciplinary group.&quot;</span>

The delivery of the intervention seems flexible and close to usual care.

Score: [4] 

6. Flexibility: Adherence

No relevant quotes. The trial does not mention any measures to enforce adherence.

Score: [NA] 

7. Follow-up

Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Primary and secondary outcomes were assessed at inclusion, and after six (M6) and 12 (M12) months.&quot;</span>

Follow-up is limited to baseline, 6 months and 12 months, which seems pragmatic.

Score: [4]

8. Primary Outcome  

Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The primary outcome was the impact of the strategy on quality of life (QoL) measured using the MSIS-29 scale at inclusion and after six months.&quot;</span>

The primary outcome of quality of life is highly relevant to patients.

Score: [5]

9. Primary Analysis

No details provided on analysis plan.

<pre>
Here are the PRECIS-2 domain scores and explanations for the trial described in the full text:

Eligibility criteria

Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;To be included in the study participants were required to have a confirmed diagnosis of MS, an Expanded Disability Status Score of between 5 and 6.5, stable drug therapy for 30 days, no relapses in the previous three months, no significant co-morbidities such as coexisting cardiac or pulmonary condition and have access to the internet via personal or tablet computer.&quot;</span>

The eligibility criteria are moderately pragmatic as they include typical MS patients who would receive this intervention in usual care. However, they exclude some patients like those with comorbidities.

Score: [3] 

Recruitment

Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Letters were sent to 138 patients from the Multiple Sclerosis Service database, thought to be suitable for the study, inviting them to participate.&quot;</span>

The recruitment method of sending invitation letters to potentially eligible patients is moderately pragmatic as some effort beyond usual care is made to recruit participants. 

Score: [3]

Setting

Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants were recruited from the Multiple Sclerosis Service, at the Douglas Grant Rehabilitation Centre, Irvine, Scotland.&quot;</span>

Conducting the trial at a single rehabilitation center is moderately explanatory compared to a multicenter trial across different settings.

Score: [2]

Organisation

Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Individualised therapeutic exercise programmes were developed for participants in Group 1, with exercises selected based on their baseline assessment and personal goals.&quot;</span>

The organization of care delivery seems very similar to usual care with individualized programs tailored to each patient.

Score: [4] 

Flexibility: Delivery

Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Individualised therapeutic exercise programmes were developed for participants in Group 1, with exercises selected based on their baseline assessment and personal goals. Participants were advised to undertake the exercise programme a minimum of twice a week and to complete their online exercise diary which was seen remotely by the physiotherapist.&quot;</span>

The flexibility in delivery is moderately pragmatic as an individualized program is provided but with some protocol on frequency and monitoring.

Score: [3]

Flexibility: Adherence 

No relevant quotes. There is no mention of measures to enforce adherence.

Score: [4] 

Follow-up

Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Outcome measures were recorded at baseline and at the end of the intervention period (week 13).&quot;</span>

Follow-up only at baseline and end of study is moderately pragmatic.

Score: [3]

Primary outcome

Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The primary outcome measure, the timed 25 foot walk, has good reliability and validity in the MS population. The time taken to walk 25ft was recorded with a stop watch and a mean of two ‘walks’ recorded.&quot;</span>

The 25 foot walk is a very pragmatic and patient-centered outcome measure.

Score: [5]

Primary analysis

Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Data from the 25ft walk was used to calculate the sample size required for a fully powered, randomized controlled trial.&quot;</span>

No details provided on primary analysis.

<p><i><span style="border-bottom: 1px dashed black;">8 quote(s) from
publication full text</span> (mean similarity 98.6%)</i></p>
<pre>
Here are the PRECIS-2 domain scores and explanations for the given paper:

1. Eligibility criteria

Quote: <span title='Moderate quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 88.5%):

To be eligible, all patients screened for study participation had to be affected by clinically definite multiple sclerosis 17 and live in the' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ff9e81'>&quot;To be eligible, all patients screened for study participation had to be affected by clinically definite multiple sclerosis and live in the Rome service area.&quot;</span>

Score: [2] Rather explanatory

This study had strict inclusion criteria requiring patients to have clinically definite MS based on specific diagnostic criteria. The patients also had to live in a certain geographic area. This limits the trial to a narrower population than would be seen in usual care.

2. Recruitment

Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Patients were recruited from the multiple sclerosis centre of the neurological department of La Sapienza University, or from other institutional centres for multiple sclerosis in Rome.&quot;</span> 

Score: [2] Rather explanatory  

Patients were recruited from specialty MS centers rather than from the settings where they would normally receive care. This makes the recruitment more explanatory.

3. Setting

Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The study was conducted in Rome and was approved by the ethics committee of La Sapienza University.&quot;</span>

Score: [2] Rather explanatory

The study was conducted at a single university site. This specialized setting is more explanatory compared to the varied settings where patients would receive usual care.

4. Organization

Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Based on individual needs, patients randomised to home based care were followed through home visits and telephone follow up. A dedicated phone number was available five days a week from 9 am to 5 pm, where an operator addressed questions or concerns from patients and caregivers and contacted the different specialists according to the specific requirement.&quot;</span>

Score: [4] Rather pragmatic

The home-based intervention used existing healthcare staff and resources that would be available in the community. This matches usual care reasonably closely.

5. Flexibility: delivery

Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The home based care multidisciplinary team included two neurologists, a urologist, a rehabilitation physician, a psychologist, a physical therapist, a nurse, a social worker, and a coordinator. These were provided with cell phones and could easily be reached for advice (telephone intervention) or direct face to face intervention when required.&quot;</span>

Score: [3] Equally pragmatic and explanatory 

The home-based care allowed for some flexibility in delivery while also having a dedicated team to provide specialized care. This balances pragmatic and explanatory elements.

6. Flexibility: adherence

Score: [NA] 

No relevant quotes found. The paper does not mention any strategies to enforce or monitor adherence.

7. Follow-up

Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;At the end of a one year follow up period, all patients underwent the same comprehensive interview as at baseline.&quot;</span>

Score: [3] Equally pragmatic and explanatory

Patients were followed for 1 year, which is longer than usual care. However, the intensity and frequency of measurement does not seem much different from usual care.

8. Primary outcome  

Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Functional outcomes were calculated as the mean change of scores from baseline to the final follow up at 12 months.&quot;</span>

Score: [4] Rather pragmatic

The primary outcome of change in functional scores is clinically meaningful for patients.

9. Primary analysis

Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;For each scale of the SF-36 and separately for the case and control group, we adopted a regression model in which score changes at the end of the follow up period were adjusted for the baseline values.&quot;</span>

Score: [5] Very pragmatic

The analysis seems to use all available data without exclusions. This is a very pragmatic, intention-to-treat approach.</pre>

publication full text</span> (mean similarity 100%)</i></p>
<pre>
Here are the PRECIS-2 domain scores and explanations for the given clinical trial:

Eligibility criteria 
Score: [4] Rather pragmatic

Relevant quotes: 
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Potential participants known to Multiple Sclerosis healthcare practitioners working across seven outpatient centres in Scotland – Ayrshire & Arran, Greater Glasgow & Clyde, Dumfries and Galloway, Lanarkshire, Lothian, Fife and Tayside – were informed of the study and issued with a participant information sheet.&quot;</span>

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants required to have a clinical diagnosis of Multiple Sclerosis, persistent foot drop (lasting a minimum of three months) observed during a 5-minute walk test, stable disease (no change in the Extended Disability Status Score12 or relapse in previous three months), 5° of passive dorsiflexion and tolerance of functional electrical stimulation.&quot;</span>

The eligibility criteria are fairly broad, including adults with a clinical diagnosis of MS and persistent foot drop, which reflects the intended real-world target population. However, some narrow exclusions like prior device use, cognitive impairment, and other gait issues make it slightly less pragmatic.

Recruitment
Score: [4] Rather pragmatic 

Relevant quotes:
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Potential participants contacted the researchers if they were interested in participating.&quot;</span> 

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive an ankle-foot orthosis or functional electrical stimulation device, by selecting the next envelope from 85 randomly ordered prefilled sealed opaque envelopes.&quot;</span>

Participants were recruited through their regular MS healthcare providers, then contacted researchers directly if interested. Simple randomization was used. Overall a fairly pragmatic recruitment approach.

Setting
Score: [5] Very pragmatic

Relevant quotes: 
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Seven Multiple Sclerosis outpatient centres across Scotland&quot;</span>

The multicenter design using real-world MS clinics makes the setting very pragmatic.

Organization
Score: [4] Rather pragmatic

Relevant quotes:
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants randomized to the usual care group were fitted with a custom-made, solid, ankle-foot orthosis by an orthotist, within four weeks of their initial assessment.&quot;</span>

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants randomized to the functional electrical stimulation group were assessed and fitted with an Odstock Dropped Foot Stimulator Pace (OML, Salisbury) device by a physiotherapist experienced in functional electrical stimulation (A.L.).&quot;</span>

The AFOs and FES were provided by clinicians as would occur in routine practice. Some additional training was required for FES, making it slightly less pragmatic.

Flexibility: Delivery
Score: [4] Rather pragmatic

Relevant quote: 
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The angle of the tibia was inclined forward, approximately 10° to vertical, and each orthosis was ‘tuned’ by the addition or removal of small heel wedges.&quot;</span>

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Electrode position, pulse width, waveform and ramping parameters were adjusted for each participant in order to achieve a comfortable and efficient muscle contraction.&quot;</span>

The devices were tuned or adjusted for each participant, allowing some flexibility in delivery while following standard procedures.

Flexibility: Adherence 
Score: [5] Very pragmatic

No measures to enforce adherence were mentioned. Participants were instructed to gradually increase wear time, implying flexibility similar to real-world use.

Follow-up
Score: [3] Equally pragmatic and explanatory

Relevant quotes:
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Outcome measures were administered by two unblinded assessors (Rebecca Hunter and A.L.) at baseline (0), 3, 6 and 12 months&quot;</span>

Follow-up more frequent than usual care, but using standard measures and reasonable duration. Pragmatic and explanatory elements.

Primary Outcome
Score: [4] Rather pragmatic

Relevant quote: 
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The primary outcome was walking speed as measured by the 5-minute self-selected walk test.&quot;</span>

Walking speed is clinically meaningful to patients. The 5-minute self-selected walk test is not used routinely but still a reasonably pragmatic choice of outcome measure.

Primary Analysis
Score: [5] Very pragmatic

No details provided, so assumed intention-to-treat as typical for superiority trials.</pre>

<p><i><span style="border-bottom: 1px dashed black;">8 quote(s) from
publication full text</span> (mean similarity 99.9%)</i></p>
<pre>
Here are the PRECIS-2 domain scores and explanations for the clinical trial described in the full text:

1. Eligibility criteria

Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants were non-institutionalized adults (age ≥ 18 years) with severe MS and their primary carers. Other patient inclusion criteria were primary or secondary progressive MS, Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score ≥ 8.0, complex symptoms, and ≥2 unmet care needs.&quot;</span>

Score: [3] The eligibility criteria include adults with severe progressive MS based on EDSS score and symptoms. This excludes milder MS cases but does not seem overly selective beyond patients who would receive palliative care. The inclusion of primary carers makes it more pragmatic.

2. Recruitment

Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Dyads were randomly assigned (2:1) to receive HPA or UC.&quot;</span> 

Score: [4] Participants were recruited at 3 centers in Italy. No details are provided on how they were recruited, but a 2:1 randomization between groups suggests pragmatic recruitment from these centers.

3. Setting

Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;In this randomized, examiner-blind, controlled study, we recruited patients from three Italian centers.&quot;</span>

Score: [4] The multicenter design across 3 sites in Italy is reasonably pragmatic.

4. Organization

Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Based on the principles of PC, each center had a HPA team consisting of a physician (neurologist or physiatrist), a nurse (case manager and team leader), a psychologist, and a social worker.&quot;</span>

Score: [3] The HPA intervention requires a dedicated multidisciplinary team, which provides more resources than usual care but seems necessary for the palliative care approach.

5. Flexibility: delivery

Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;After a comprehensive assessment of the dyad needs based on direct observation and on visit 1 information (available via the eCRF), the HPA team defined the contents of the intervention, involving the dyad and the patient caring physician.&quot;</span>

Score: [4] The HPA intervention was individualized for each patient based on initial assessment and tailored during the study. This provides flexibility similar to usual palliative care.

6. Flexibility: adherence

No relevant quotes.

Score: [NA] Adherence is not discussed. As a home-based palliative care approach, adherence is likely flexible.

7. Follow-up

Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The blind examiners used a web-based case report form (eCRF), so that visit 1–3 data were available to HPA teams and coordination unit.&quot;</span>

Score: [2] Participants were assessed at baseline, 3 months, and 6 months. The use of blinded examiners and frequent assessments is more explanatory.

8. Primary outcome

Quote: <span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 99.3%):

The pre-specified primary endpoints were changes in patient quality of life (SEIQoL-DW) and symptom burden (PC Outcome Scale-Symptoms-MS, POSS-MS).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;The pre-specified primary endpoints were changes in patient quality of life (SEIQoL-DW) and symptom burden (PC Outcome Scale-Symptoms-MS, POS-S-MS).&quot;</span>

Score: [4] The co-primary outcomes of quality of life and symptom burden are highly patient-centered and pragmatic choices.

9. Primary analysis

Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;All randomly assigned patients were included in the main intention-to-treat analysis, provided that at least one contact with the team occurred (HPA group).&quot;</span>

Score: [5] The study used an intention-to-treat approach including all randomized participants with at least one contact. This is very pragmatic.</pre>

<pre>
Here are the PRECIS-2 domain assessments for the trial:

Eligibility criteria:

Relevant quotes:
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The main inclusion criteria were: (1) clinically definite MS diagnosis, (2) fatigue impacting on daily life (Fatigue Severity Scale total score >4) and (3) ambulatory.&quot;</span>

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The main exclusion criteria were: (1) having taken part in a fatigue programme in the last year, (2) cognitive impairments, (3) a relapse in the previous 3 months or (4) having started treatment with disease modifying or antidepressant drugs within the previous 3 months.&quot;</span>

The eligibility criteria are moderately pragmatic - patients had to have a definite MS diagnosis and significant fatigue, which matches the intended intervention population. However, some patients were excluded such as those with cognitive impairment or recent relapse/treatment changes, which reduces generalizability. Overall, a mix of pragmatic and explanatory elements.

Score: [3]

Recruitment:

Relevant quotes:
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants were recruited in three UK centres (Poole, Bristol, Southampton/Portsmouth) from primary or secondary care, or via MS Society newsletters/websites.&quot;</span>

The recruitment methods used multiple settings including routine clinical settings as well as MS Society channels. This pragmatic approach reaches the broad intended population without significant additional effort beyond routine practice.

Score: [4] 

Setting:

Relevant quotes:
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants were recruited in three UK centres (Poole, Bristol, Southampton/Portsmouth) from primary or secondary care, or via MS Society newsletters/websites.&quot;</span>

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;FACETS was delivered in hotel meeting-room facilities, with the exception of one centre, where it was held in a rehabilitation hospital.&quot;</span>

The setting included multiple centers and a mix of clinical and non-clinical locations. This moderately pragmatic approach matches routine care settings where the intervention would be applied.

Score: [3]

Organisation:

Relevant quotes:

rall, 10 FACETS programmes were run with group sizes ranging from 4 to 11 (mean=7.4; SD=2.1)' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;In all, 10 FACETS programmes were run with group sizes ranging from 4 to 11 (mean=7.4; SD=2.1).&quot;</span> 

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Facilitators were all qualified to a senior/advanced level (in the UK minimum of a Band 7 on the NHS Agenda for Change (AfC) grading structure).&quot;</span>

The staffing and resources to deliver the intervention appear well-aligned with routine practice without requiring substantially more expertise or investment. This pragmatic design should enable feasible implementation.

Score: [4]

Flexibility (delivery):

Relevant quotes:
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The facilitator manual provides guidance on preparation and delivery, detailed session content, notes and suggested timings, and a checklist of facilitator objectives as well as signposts to additional resources.&quot;</span>

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;A companion participant handbook, along with existing information booklets, reinforces programme content.&quot;</span> 

The structured manualized program allows for some flexibility in delivery while maintaining standardization. This moderately pragmatic approach balances flexibility and intervention fidelity.

Score: [3] 

Flexibility (adherence):

No relevant quotes. The paper does not mention any specific strategies to enforce or monitor adherence. In the absence of evidence to the contrary, I will assume a pragmatic approach similar to routine care.

Score: [4]

Follow-up:

Relevant quotes:
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Individuals who had attended a fatigue management programme in the past year were excluded from the trial as were those who had received a fatigue intervention from a health professional in the past 3 months (see protocol).&quot;</span>

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Outcomes were measured 1 week (baseline) before the start of FACETS and 1 month (follow-up 1) and 4 months (follow-up 2) after the final session.&quot;</span>

The follow-up timeline appears moderately pragmatic with assessments at 1 and 4 months post-intervention, not substantially different from routine care. Participants were excluded if they recently received fatigue management, reducing generalizability.

Score: [3]

Primary outcome:

Relevant quotes: 

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;These were: (1) fatigue severity (Global Fatigue Severity (GFS) subscale of the Fatigue Assessment Instrument (FAI)), (2) disease-specific quality of life (QOL) (total score on the Multiple Sclerosis Impact Scale, V.1 (MSIS-29, V.1)) and (3) self-efficacy for managing fatigue (Multiple Sclerosis-Fatigue Self-Efficacy scale—adapted from the Control subscale of the MS Self-Efficacy scale).&quot;</span>

The primary outcomes of fatigue severity, disease-specific QOL, and self-efficacy are highly relevant to the participants and aim of the intervention. This pragmatic choice focuses on patient-centered measures.

Score: [5] 

Primary analysis:

Relevant quotes:

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The main analysis was intention-to-treat but we also conducted a ‘per protocol’ analysis (excluding participants who attended fewer than four FACETS sessions).&quot;</span>

The primary analysis using intention-to-treat is a pragmatic approach that includes all randomized participants. This matches routine implementation and supports generalizability.

1. Eligibility criteria 

Quotes:
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;MS patients older than 18 years who had a confirmed MS with spasticity of the lower limbs and an Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score between 4 and 6.5 were eligible for inclusion.&quot;</span>

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Patients who had received hippotherapy within the last 12 months, a body weight over 90 kg, no balance while sitting, and acute exacerbation during the 4-week period before start of the therapy were excluded.&quot;</span> 

Explanation: The eligibility criteria are moderately pragmatic. Patients of all adult ages with confirmed MS diagnosis and some degree of disability are included, reflecting a typical MS population that would receive this intervention in usual care. However, patients with very severe or very mild disability are excluded, as are those with recent exacerbations or hippotherapy. <span style='background-color: #ffe9e2' title='Moved squared brackets during extraction'>Score: [3]</span>

2. Recruitment

Quote: 
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Eligible patients were randomized to one of the two groups using sealed opaque envelopes on the basis of a computer-generated randomization list.&quot;</span>

Explanation: The text does not provide details on how patients were identified and recruited into the trial. However, there is no mention of extra recruitment efforts beyond what would occur in usual care. <span style='background-color: #ffe9e2' title='Moved squared brackets during extraction'>Score: [NA]</span> 

3. Setting

Quote:
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The study was conducted at five sites in Germany, all of which have hippotherapy experience as stipulated by the rules of the German Consortium for Therapeutic Riding.&quot;</span>

Explanation: The trial was conducted at multiple specialized centers in Germany that regularly provide hippotherapy. This matches the setting where hippotherapy would normally be delivered for MS patients. <span style='background-color: #ffe9e2' title='Moved squared brackets during extraction'>Score: [5]</span>

4. Organization

Quote: 
<span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 99.6%):

7. Follow-up

Quote: 
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Examinations and questionnaires were completed prior to the first hippotherapy session (baseline), after 6–7 weeks (interim assessment) and after 12 weeks (final assessment).&quot;</span>

Explanation: Follow-up matches the intervention period with assessments at baseline, mid-point, and end. There is no mention of additional unscheduled visits or more extensive data collection. <span style='background-color: #ffe9e2' title='Moved squared brackets during extraction'>Score: [5]</span>

8. Primary outcome  

Quote:

Here are the domain assessments for the provided full text:

Eligibility criteria:

Relevant quotes:
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants eligible for inclusion were adults aged over 15 years with one of the following possible recorded diagnoses: MS, PD and other causes of progressive parkinsonism, motor neurone disease, Huntington's disease and other degenerative disorders affecting the central nervous system, muscles or peripheral nerves.&quot;</span>

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;In order to preserve a focus on primarily physical disabilities, dementing disorders such as Alzheimer's disease were not included.&quot;</span> 

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants whose clinical features appeared incompatible with the recorded diagnosis were excluded, as were those with neurological complications of primarily non-neurological conditions such as diabetes mellitus, or additional causes of severe disability.&quot;</span>

The eligibility criteria are moderately pragmatic. The inclusion criteria are broad, including adults over 15 with a range of progressive neurological conditions. However, the exclusion of dementing disorders and some comorbidities makes the criteria more selective. Overall, the criteria seem intended to identify a specific population with primarily physical disabilities, which matches the intent of the study.

Score: [3]

Recruitment:

Relevant quotes:  
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;From July 1998 we approached the 177 GPs based within the City of Nottingham boundaries (population 282000). Participants eligible for inclusion were adults aged over 15 years with one of the following possible recorded diagnoses: MS, PD and other causes of progressive parkinsonism, motor neurone disease, Huntington's disease and other degenerative disorders affecting the central nervous system, muscles or peripheral nerves.&quot;</span>

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;To avoid ascertainment bias towards people already receiving specific health or social services, we used GP information as the sole method for identifying potential participants.&quot;</span>

The recruitment seems moderately pragmatic - participants were identified from GP records rather than through advertising or other special efforts. Using only GP records avoids bias toward those already receiving services. However, some additional effort beyond routine practice was required to search records and identify eligible patients.

Score: [3] 

Setting:

Relevant quotes:
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The study took place between August 1997 and March 2000 and was approved by the research ethics committee of Queen's Medical Centre (Nottingham, UK). Each participant gave written informed consent.&quot;</span> 

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants' homes in the City of Nottingham.&quot;</span>

The setting seems very pragmatic - the study was conducted in participants' own homes in the community. This matches the intended real-world application.

Score: [5]

Organization:

Relevant quotes:  
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;In the education group (EG), baseline data were reviewed by an expert panel which advised on actions most likely to promote each individual's physical, social and psychological well-being. An occupational therapist (OT) then visited EG participants to provide education and information and to discuss a personalized 12-month health action plan.&quot;</span>

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The comparison group (CoG) received standardized printed information delivered to their home.&quot;</span>

The organization is moderately pragmatic. The intervention group received home visits and individualized plans from an OT, which requires some additional resources compared to usual care. However, the visits utilized existing healthcare staff and expertise. The control group received only standard printed materials, closer to usual care.

Score: [3]

Flexibility of experimental intervention - delivery:

Relevant quotes:
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;An occupational therapist (OT) then visited EG participants to provide education and information and to discuss a personalized 12-month health action plan.&quot;</span>

The delivery of the intervention seems moderately flexible and pragmatic. The education and advice were personalized for each participant, rather than being a rigid, protocol-driven program. However, the OT provided the intervention in a visit rather than leaving the delivery more flexible.

Score: [3] 

Flexibility of experimental intervention - adherence:

Relevant quotes: 
No relevant quotes found.

The full text does not mention any specific measures to enforce or monitor adherence. In the absence of other information, this suggests a pragmatic approach similar to usual care.

Score: [NA]

Follow-up:

Relevant quotes:
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Information on adverse events was collected by phone at two-monthly intervals between baseline and 12-month assessments, when a general enquiry was made without specific reference to falls or sores.&quot;</span>

The follow-up seems moderately pragmatic. Participants were contacted by phone every 2 months to collect outcomes data. This is more frequent than usual care but was done with simple phone calls rather than extensive in-person assessments. 

Score: [3]

Primary outcome:

Relevant quotes:  
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Primary outcome measures were reports of one or more falls or skin sores. At interview, participants were asked 'In the past 12 months, have you fallen? Have you had a skin sore?'&quot;</span>

The primary outcomes are very pragmatic and patient-centered. Falls and skin sores are directly relevant adverse events for patients with neurological conditions. The outcomes were collected simply by asking patients, similar to usual care.

Score: [5]

Primary analysis:

Relevant quotes: 
No relevant quotes found. 

The full text does not provide information about the primary analysis method.

Here are the PRECIS-2 domain scores and explanations for the given trial:

Eligibility criteria

Quotes:
<span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Inclusion criteria—Patients with confirmed diagnosis: ≥16 years of age with unilateral facial nerve weakness of no identifiable cause who presented to primary care or an emergency department and could be referred to a collaborating otorhinolaryngologist <72 hours after the onset of symptoms.&quot;</span>

<span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Exclusion criteria—Pregnancy, breast feeding, uncontrolled diabetes, peptic ulcer disease, suppurative otitis media, herpes zoster, multiple sclerosis, systematic infection, sarcoidosis and other rare conditions, and an inability to provide informed consent.&quot;</span> 

<span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Extra test—Randomised controlled trial of Bell’s palsy treatment required senior otorhinolaryngologist in hospitals to confirm a patient’s eligibility to participate. Bell’s palsy is usually diagnosed by a general practitioner in primary care.&quot;</span>

Explanation: The trial has strict inclusion/exclusion criteria and requires an extra test by a specialist not routinely done in usual care. This makes the eligibility criteria more explanatory.

Score: [2]

Follow-up:

Quotes: 
<span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Clinical follow-up until patient left hospital (discharge or death) or until 30 days after surgery, whichever was the longer, so more than usual care.&quot;</span>

<span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Monitoring intensity involved more extensive data collection than usual: Pre-operation—three-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) Holter monitor (Flashcard with 2×48 hour recording) set up on each patient and maintained for 72 hours. Troponin values at 1, 3, and 7 days after surgery (more usual for only 1 and 3 days after surgery) ECG after randomisation and at 7 and 30 days after surgery.&quot;</span>

Explanation: The trial had more frequent and longer follow-up than usual care, with more extensive data collection. This makes follow-up more explanatory.

Score: [1]

Primary outcome:

Quotes: 
<span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Primary outcome—Recovery of facial function as rated on the House-Brackmann scale.&quot;</span> 

<span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Test not routinely used in primary care and requires training. It is, however, an easy clinical test widely used in secondary care for grading recovery from facial nerve paralysis caused by damage to lower motor neurons.&quot;</span>

<span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Central adjudication—Photographs taken of patients were assessed and graded independently by a panel of three experts (not general practitioners, who usually assess).&quot;</span>

Explanation: The primary outcome required specialized tests not done in usual care and central adjudication. This makes the primary outcome more explanatory.

Score: [1]

Here are the PRECIS-2 domain scores and explanations for the given full text:

Eligibility criteria:

Quotes:
<span title='Major quote deviation, possible hallucination. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 74%):

Inclusion criteria were the following: diagnosis of MS made by a neurologist, able to walk 10 meters with or without an aid within 2 minutes, no relapse of their MS in the past 4 weeks, and no other' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: red'>&quot;Inclusion criteria were the following: diagnosis of MS made by a neurologist, able to walk 10 meters with or without an aid within 2 minutes, no relapse of their MS in the past 4 weeks, and no other neurological or orthopedic condition that would affect their function.&quot;</span>

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Eligible participants were excluded from the study if they were already engaged in a formal exercise program lasting >30 minutes twice per week, experienced an exacerbation within the past 4 weeks, had their MS immunomodulation medications altered in the previous 4 weeks or during the trial period, or declined to be randomly allocated.&quot;</span>

Explanation: The eligibility criteria are moderately pragmatic as they include MS patients who would be typical candidates for the intervention in usual care, such as those able to walk 10 meters aided or unaided. However, some exclusions like those already engaged in formal exercise make it less pragmatic.

Score: [3]

Recruitment:

Quote: 
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Community dwelling people with MS were recruited through the Multiple Sclerosis Society of New South Wales and South Australia.&quot;</span>

Explanation: Recruitment was done through an MS society rather than recruitment during usual clinic visits, which makes it moderately pragmatic but not completely identical to usual care.

Score: [3]  

Setting:

Quote:
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The group program was conducted at a local community center and included four to six participants per class.&quot;</span>

Explanation: The setting of a local community center is very similar to usual care for an exercise intervention and hence pragmatic. 

Score: [4]

Organization:

Quote:  
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Groups were led by a physiotherapist employed by the Multiple Sclerosis Society who received training to ensure a standard approach to intervention, intensity, and progression.&quot;</span>

Explanation: The physiotherapists had usual expertise and resources like in standard care, making the organization pragmatic.

Score: [4]

Flexibility (delivery):

Quote: 
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Guidelines were provided to physiotherapists and participants for exercises to be adapted and progressed to suit individual functional ability via increasing repetitions, amplitude of movement, speed of movement, and modifying base of support.&quot;</span>

Explanation: The delivery allowed flexibility for physiotherapists to adapt the exercises like in usual practice, which is very pragmatic.

Score: [5] 

Flexibility (adherence):

Quote:
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Home exercise participants were provided with one center-based physiotherapist-led session at the commencement of the intervention period for training, and telephone support by a physiotherapist to discuss their program every 2 weeks.&quot;</span>

Explanation: There was usual encouragement for adherence through telephone support, making it very pragmatic. No special measures were taken to enforce adherence.

Score: [5]

Follow-up:

Quote: 
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants attended a local community center to complete all assessments at pre-intervention (week 0), post-intervention (week 8), and at follow-up (week 16).&quot;</span>

Explanation: Follow-up assessments were done at baseline, post-intervention and 8 weeks after, which is more frequent than usual care. This makes it moderately explanatory.

Score: [2]

Primary outcome:

Quote:  
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The primary outcome measure was gait speed, measured using the 10-meter walk test.&quot;</span>

Explanation: The 10-meter walk test is a very relevant outcome measure for MS patients in usual practice, making it highly pragmatic.

Score: [5]

Primary analysis:

Quote:
<span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 96.9%):

Data were analyzed according to the intention-totreat principle' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;Data were analyzed according to the intention-to-treat principle.&quot;</span>

Explanation: The use of intention-to-treat analysis includes all randomized participants, which is a very pragmatic approach.

<p><i><span style="border-bottom: 1px dashed black;">5 quote(s) from
publication full text</span> (mean similarity 99.9%)</i></p>
<pre>
Here are the PRECIS-2 domain scores and explanations:

Eligibility criteria 
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;We included expectant mothers of different ages and states from the 37th week in where child birth was expected any time (induced or conduced) having: dilations at ≥ 4 cm, two or more contractions in 10 minutes, skin covering the whole of the SP6 bilateral point and with a live fetus with a cephalic vertex and in good condition.&quot;</span>

Score: [4] Rather pragmatic

The eligibility criteria are reasonably broad, including expectant mothers from 37 weeks gestation onward with cervical dilation ≥4 cm and at least 2 contractions per 10 minutes. The criteria do not appear to exclude based on adherence, responsiveness, or requiring additional tests not used in usual care. However, the criteria are still somewhat narrow by excluding earlier than 37 weeks gestation and those without cephalic presentation.

Recruitment
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The pregnant women in labor were allocated through a sequential list of random numbers in blocks of six patients generated using the program Excel® and they were distributed in three groups&quot;</span> 

Score: [3] Equally pragmatic and explanatory

Participants were recruited at a university hospital setting, which may not reflect the full spectrum of usual care settings. However, no additional recruitment efforts beyond usual care are described.

Setting
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;It was carried out between January and August of 2013. The subjects were pregnant women admitted to a teaching tertiary public hospital on the outskirts of the state of Sao Paulo, Brazil.&quot;</span>

Score: [2] Rather explanatory 

The trial was conducted at a single specialized university hospital, which likely differs from the typical setting where results would be applied.

Organization
Quote: No relevant quotes

Score: [NA] Not enough information 

There is insufficient detail provided on resources, expertise, and care delivery to assess this domain.

Flexibility: delivery
Quote: No relevant quotes 

Score: [NA] Not enough information

There is insufficient detail provided on flexibility in delivering the intervention to assess this domain.

Flexibility: adherence
Quote: No relevant quotes

Score: [NA] Not enough information 

There is insufficient detail provided on measures to ensure participant adherence to assess this domain.

Follow-up 
Quote: <span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 99.3%):

VAS was used to evaluate the pain and for predeveloped questions. The women were able to classify their perception of the pain (Table 3).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;VAS was used to evaluate the pain and for pre-developed questions. The women were able to classify their perception of the pain (Table 3).&quot;</span>

Score: [3] Equally pragmatic and explanatory

Follow-up assessments were done at baseline, 20 minutes, and 60 minutes to evaluate pain using the VAS scale. The limited follow-up timepoints seem reasonably aligned with usual care. However, the VAS scale itself may represent more extensive data collection than typical.

Primary outcome
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;For conducting evaluations on the pain we opted for the VAS model which is a rising scale from 0 10, 0 meaning no pain to 10 which is the worst pain felt.&quot;</span>

Score: [5] Very pragmatic 

The primary outcome of labor pain intensity is directly relevant and meaningful to the participants.

Primary analysis
Quote: No relevant quotes

Score: [NA] Not enough information

Details of the primary analysis are not provided to assess the extent to which all data were included.</pre>

publication full text</span> (mean similarity 100%)</i></p>
<pre>
Here are the PRECIS-2 domain scores and explanations for the given clinical trial:

1. Eligibility criteria 

Relevant quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Inclusion criteria were patients aged 45-65 with mild and moderate COPD (grade II and III) as the primary disease.&quot;</span>
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Excluded were individuals who had another major disease&quot;</span> [...] <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;, who were non-Icelandic speaking, not capable of travelling to the treatment site and those who had participated in a structured rehabilitation programme for people with COPD 6 months prior to the screening.&quot;</span>

The inclusion criteria focused on patients with mild to moderate COPD as the primary disease, which matches the target population for the intervention. The exclusions were reasonable and did not overly restrict the participants to those most likely to have good outcomes.

Score: [4] Rather pragmatic

2. Recruitment

Relevant quote: 
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Patients were recruited from each of the primary health care centres and lung physicians’ offices.&quot;</span>

Patients were recruited through their regular health care providers, which matches how the target population would be identified in usual care. No additional efforts like media campaigns or incentives were mentioned.

Score: [5] Very pragmatic  

3. Setting

Relevant quote:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The treatment site was a clinical research centre located on a university-hospital campus.&quot;</span> 

The treatment was delivered at a research center rather than the clinics where patients receive usual care. This makes the setting more explanatory.

Score: [2] Rather explanatory

4. Organization

Relevant quote: 
- No details provided on extra staffing, training, resources etc. for delivering the intervention.

No evidence that additional expertise or resources beyond usual care were used. 

Score: [5] Very pragmatic

5. Flexibility: Delivery

Relevant quote:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The main approach is to work with patients and families to find out what is meaningful for them in life as regards health and jointly decide on that which is possible and relevant for each patient and family.&quot;</span>

The partnership-based intervention was flexible and tailored to each patient's needs and priorities.

Score: [5] Very pragmatic

6. Flexibility: Adherence

Relevant quote: 
- No mention of specific measures to enforce or monitor adherence.

No evidence that adherence was monitored or enforced beyond what would occur in usual care.

Score: [5] Very pragmatic

7. Follow-up

Relevant quote:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Data were collected at baseline and at month 12. Additionally, data collection was carried out in the experimental group at month 6 after the last treatment session.&quot;</span>

Follow-up data collection was at 6 and 12 months, which is not excessive for this type of intervention.

Score: [4] Rather pragmatic

8. Primary outcome  

Relevant quote: 
- Primary outcomes included quality of life, anxiety, depression, illness intrusiveness, physical activity, exacerbations.

The outcomes measured are clinically meaningful for COPD patients.

Score: [5] Very pragmatic

9. Primary analysis

Relevant quote:
- No details provided on how missing data or protocol deviations were handled. 

No evidence that the primary analysis deviated from an intention-to-treat approach.

Score: [5] Very pragmatic

In summary, this trial has a rather pragmatic design overall, with some exceptions like the explanatory setting. The PRECIS-2 assessment highlights areas where design choices could be re-considered to better match the intended purpose.</pre>

<pre>
Here are the PRECIS-2 domain scores and explanations for the given clinical trial text:

Eligibility criteria 
Quote: <span title='Major quote deviation, possible hallucination. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 63.8%):

From their computerised asthma registers the practices identified adults (>18 years) who had asked for a bronchodilator inhaler prescription in the previ' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: red'>&quot;From their computerised asthma registers the practices identified adults (>18 years) who had asked for a bronchodilator inhaler prescription in the previ-ous six months but who had not had a routine asthma review in the preceding 11 months.&quot;</span>

The eligibility criteria are quite broad, including adults with asthma who are due for their routine review. The criteria rely on data readily available in the GP practices to identify eligible patients. Overall, the eligibility seems to target a patient population that is very similar to real world asthma patients receiving routine reviews.

Score: [4] Rather pragmatic

Recruitment  
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;We wrote to all eligible patients inviting them to take part in the study.&quot;</span>

Patients were recruited by mailing invitation letters to eligible patients identified from the GP practice records. This seems like a fairly pragmatic form of recruitment that could be implemented in real world settings, without extensive advertising or incentives.

Score: [4] Rather pragmatic


Setting
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;All four general practices that took part in the study had nurses who were trained and experienced in providing proactive asthma care&quot;</span>

The trial was conducted in multiple general practices with nurses experienced in asthma care. This matches the real world setting where asthma reviews take place in general practices.

Score: [5] Very pragmatic

Organisation
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Nurses were given no instructions about the content of the review except that it should reflect their normal practice and be appropriate to each patient’s clinical need.&quot;</span>

The asthma nurses conducted the reviews as part of their normal workload and practice. No additional training, staffing or resources were provided. This matches real world organisation of asthma reviews.

Score: [5] Very pragmatic

Flexibility: delivery
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Nurses were given no instructions about the content of the review except that it should reflect their normal practice and be appropriate to each patient’s clinical need.&quot;</span>

The nurses had flexibility to deliver the intervention as per their normal practice, with no strict protocol or monitoring of compliance. This allows for real world flexibility.

Score: [5] Very pragmatic

Flexibility: adherence 
Quote: No relevant quotes

The text does not mention any measures to enforce or monitor patient adherence. It seems adherence was handled as per usual care.

Score: [5] Very pragmatic

Follow-up
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Follow up questionnaires on morbidity and satisfaction with the consultation were sent to the patients at three months.&quot;</span>

Patients were followed up at 3 months via questionnaires to assess outcomes. This limited follow-up seems reasonably close to real world practice.

Score: [4] Rather pragmatic

Primary outcome  
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Primary outcome measures were the proportion of participants who were reviewed within three months of randomisation and disease specific quality of life, as measured by the Juniper mini asthma quality of life questionnaire.&quot;</span>

The primary outcomes of review rate and quality of life are highly relevant to patients. Quality of life was measured using a validated questionnaire.

Score: [5] Very pragmatic

Primary analysis
Quote: No relevant quotes.

The text does not mention any exclusions from analysis. Likely an intention-to-treat approach was used.

<p><i><span style="border-bottom: 1px dashed black;">7 quote(s) from
publication full text</span> (mean similarity 99.7%)</i></p>
<pre>
Here are the PRECIS-2 domain scores and explanations for the given full text:

Eligibility criteria 
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The inclusion criteria were: a positive diagnosis of RA (1987 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria), age 18 years or older and the ability to complete questionnaires unaided.&quot;</span>

Score: [4] Rather pragmatic

The eligibility criteria are fairly broad, including adults with confirmed RA diagnosis based on standard criteria. The only exclusion is inability to complete questionnaires unaided, which is reasonable for a self-reported outcome trial. Overall, the criteria seem to aim for a patient population similar to routine RA care.

Recruitment  
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;After gaining patient consent, demographics and disease activity score in 28 joints (DAS28), patients were randomly assigned using a remote secure telephone randomisation service provided by Leeds University Clinical Trials Research Unit.&quot;</span>

Score: [5] Very pragmatic  

Patients were recruited during routine rheumatology clinic visits, reflecting the normal process of engaging RA patients in care. No special efforts like advertising or incentives were used.

Setting
Quote: <span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 97.7%):

The study was conducted in outpatient clinics of 10 rheumatology centres across the UK.' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;This study was conducted in outpatient clinics of 10 rheumatology centres across the UK.&quot;</span>

Score: [5] Very pragmatic

The trial was done in the same rheumatology clinic settings where RA is normally treated, across multiple centers. This matches the intended real-world application.

Organisation
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The CNS have experience in running nurse-led clinics and usually have a postgraduate qualification in rheumatology nursing and/or prescribing.&quot;</span>

Score: [4] Rather pragmatic

The nurses delivering the intervention had special rheumatology training and experience running nurse clinics, which is reasonably representative of specialized RA care. No major increases in staffing or resources were described.

Flexibility: delivery
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The NLC interventions usually include allocated 30-min time slots in which the CNS takes history, performs physical examination, pain control, prescribing or recommending medication and dosage changes, intra-articular or intramuscular steroid injections, provision of patient education, psychosocial support and ordering blood tests or X-rays.&quot;</span>

Score: [3] Equally pragmatic and explanatory

The nurse-led care seems moderately protocolized but with some flexibility in components like education and psychosocial support. The description does not indicate strict adherence monitoring.

Flexibility: adherence
Quote: No relevant information provided.

Score: [NA]

Follow-up
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The primary outcome was DAS28 and secondary outcomes were pain severity (pain-VAS), fatigue (fatigue-VAS) and duration of morning stiffness measured at each study visit.&quot;</span> 

Score: [3] Equally pragmatic and explanatory

Follow-up occurred at protocol-specified intervals rather than usual care. However, the outcomes were patient-reported and clinically relevant. Overall intensity seems intermediate.
  
Primary outcome
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The primary outcome was DAS28 and secondary outcomes were pain severity (pain-VAS), fatigue (fatigue-VAS) and duration of morning stiffness measured at each study visit.&quot;</span>

Score: [4] Rather pragmatic

DAS28 is a composite disease activity measure combining joint counts and patient self-report. It is clinically meaningful and commonly used to monitor RA in practice.

Primary analysis
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Analysis followed per-protocol (PP) and intention-to-treat (ITT) approaches.&quot;</span>

Score: [5] Very pragmatic

The analysis was intention-to-treat, consistent with a pragmatic approach.

In summary, this trial aims for a patient population, setting, care delivery, and outcomes that match real-world RA management, with some protocolization of the nurse-led intervention. The PRECIS-2 scores indicate an overall moderately pragmatic design.</pre>

<p><i><span style="border-bottom: 1px dashed black;">8 quote(s) from
publication full text</span> (mean similarity 100%)</i></p>
<pre>
Here are the PRECIS-2 domain scores and explanations for the given full text:

1. Eligibility criteria

Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants had established CVD or an estimated five-year CVD risk of ≥15%, with indications for antiplatelet, statin and ≥2 blood pressure lowering drugs&quot;</span>

Score: [3] The eligibility criteria include both patients with established CVD and those at high estimated risk, which matches usual care. However, they had to have indications for all the polypill components, which may exclude some patients who would normally receive some of the treatments. Overall this seems a mix of pragmatic and explanatory elements.

2. Recruitment

Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants randomized to the ‘polypill-based strategy’ received a polypill containing aspirin 75 mg, simvastatin 40 mg, lisinopril 10 mg and either atenolol 50 mg or hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg. Participants randomized to ‘usual care’ continued with separate medications and doses as prescribed by their doctor.&quot;</span>  

Score: [4] Participants were randomized after being recruited, implying they were already receiving care. No special efforts beyond usual care are mentioned. Overall recruitment seems mostly pragmatic.

3. Setting

Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;We conducted a randomized, open-label trial involving 623 participants from Australian general practices.&quot;</span>

Score: [4] Conducted in general practices where patients would normally receive care. Multi-center increases applicability. Overall a pragmatic setting.

4. Organization

Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;All participants were treated by their regular doctor following randomization.&quot;</span>

Score: [5] No changes were made to expertise or resources beyond usual care. Very pragmatic organization.

5. Flexibility: Delivery

Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Those allocated to the polypill-based strategy were prescribed one of the polypill versions at the discretion of their doctor.&quot;</span>

Score: [4] The polypill was prescribed but doctors could modify as needed, similar to usual care. Mostly pragmatic flexibility.

6. Flexibility: Adherence 

No relevant quotes.

Score: [NA] Adherence of participants is not discussed.

7. Follow-up

Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants attended the primary healthcare centres for trial assessments at randomization and 12 month intervals thereafter.&quot;</span>

Score: [3] Follow-up visits occurred but were not excessive. Frequency seems intermediate between pragmatic and explanatory. 

8. Primary outcome

Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Primary outcomes were self-reported use of indicated combination treatment&quot;</span> [...] <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;at study end; and changes in systolic BP and total cholesterol from baseline to study end.&quot;</span>

Score: [4] Outcomes of medication adherence, blood pressure and cholesterol are clinically meaningful. Mostly pragmatic choice of outcomes.

9. Primary analysis

No analysis details provided.

Score: [NA] The analysis approach is not described.</pre>

publication full text</span> (mean similarity 99.9%)</i></p>
<pre>
Here are the PRECIS-2 domain scores and explanations for the given trial:

1. Eligibility criteria 
Score: [3]

Relevant quotes:
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Patients were eligible for inclusion if they were aged 16 years or older and presented within 3 weeks after sustaining a displaced fracture of the proximal humerus that involved the surgical neck.&quot;</span>
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Excluded patients had associated dislocation of the injured shoulder joint, open fracture, insufficient mental capacity to understand the trial or instructions for rehabilitation, comorbidities precluding surgery or anesthesia, clear indication for surgery such as severe soft-tissue compromise, multiple injuries (upper limb fractures), pathological fracture (other than osteoporotic), terminal illness, or were not a resident in the hospital catchment area.&quot;</span>

The eligibility criteria are moderately pragmatic. Patients of all adult ages are included, which is pragmatic. However, patients with comorbidities precluding surgery are excluded, as well as those with clear indications for surgery, which makes it more explanatory. Overall, I think it balances out to be equally pragmatic and explanatory.

2. Recruitment
Score: [4] 
Relevant quotes: 
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Patients received their allocated treatment from the recruiting hospital.&quot;</span>

The patients seem to be recruited during routine care at the participating hospitals. There is no mention of any special recruitment efforts like media campaigns or incentives. This makes recruitment rather pragmatic.

3. Setting
Score: [4]

Relevant quotes:  
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The PROFHER collaborators recruited patients for this pragmatic, open, multicenter, parallel-group, superiority, randomized clinical trial between September 2008 and April 2011 from orthopedic departments (fracture clinics or wards) at 32 acute UK National Health Service hospitals.&quot;</span>

The trial is conducted at 32 acute NHS hospitals across the UK that routinely provide standard surgical and nonsurgical fracture treatment. This multicenter design across routine care settings is a rather pragmatic choice.

4. Organization
Score: [4]

Relevant quotes:
<span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 99%):

Care pathways for all patients included outpatientand community-based rehabilitation, which primarily comprised 1 or more 1-on-1 sessions with a physiotherapist that focused on restoring function.' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;Care pathways for all patients included outpatient- and community-based rehabilitation, which primarily comprised 1 or more 1-on-1 sessions with a physiotherapist that focused on restoring function.&quot;</span>
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;To avoid learning curve problems, surgeons and physiotherapists used surgical interventions and procedures with which they were familiar.&quot;</span> 

The trial appears to utilize the existing standard of care in terms of staff expertise, resources, and organization. Surgeons performed procedures they were familiar with. This approach is rather pragmatic.

5. Flexibility: Delivery
Score: [4]

Relevant quotes: 
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;It was emphasized that good standards of care, both surgical and nonsurgical, should be provided throughout the treatment pathway for the injury, including surgical care or management of the sling, postoperative care, and rehabilitation in both groups.&quot;</span>

The delivery of the interventions seems flexible and according to usual care standards, which is a rather pragmatic choice. No strict protocol is mentioned.

6. Flexibility: Adherence
Score: [5]

Relevant quotes:
No relevant quotes found.

There is no mention of any measures to enforce or monitor adherence. This suggests a very pragmatic approach.

7. Follow-up
Score: [3]

Relevant quotes:
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Follow-up was up to 2 years (until April 2013) for all patients.&quot;</span> 
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The OSS was collected by postal questionnaires at 6, 12, and 24 months.&quot;</span>

A 2-year follow-up via mailed questionnaires is moderately pragmatic. It is longer than usual care but done remotely without extensive in-person data collection.

8. Primary outcome
Score: [5] 

Relevant quotes:  
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The primary outcome was the Oxford Shoulder Score (OSS), which is a shoulder-specific outcome measure validated in a UK population.&quot;</span>

The OSS is a patient-reported outcome directly relevant to participants. This is a very pragmatic choice of primary outcome.

9. Primary analysis
Score: [5]

Relevant quotes:
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Analyses followed a prespecified analysis plan, endorsed by the data monitoring and ethics committee, and were performed using Stata version 12 (StataCorp). All analyses were on an intention-to-treat basis and included all randomized patients in the groups to which they were randomized.&quot;</span>

The intention-to-treat analysis is very pragmatic.</pre>

publication full text</span> (mean similarity 99.9%)</i></p>
<pre>
Here are the PRECIS-2 domain scores and explanations for the given trial:

Eligibility criteria 
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Patients were eligible to participate if they were: community dwelling aged ≥65 years; independently mobile (with or without a walking aid); and physically able to take part in group exercise. Patients were excluded if they: had experienced ≥3 falls in the previous year; had unstable clinical conditions; would be unable to follow instructions about exercise safely; or were receiving palliative care.&quot;</span>

Score: [3] The eligibility criteria are moderately pragmatic. The trial is limited to community-dwelling older adults who are mobile and able to participate in group exercise. However, they exclude some patients who may benefit from the intervention in usual care, such as those with a history of falls or unstable conditions. Overall, the criteria strike a balance between being pragmatic and ensuring patient safety.

Recruitment
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Practices were recruited with assistance from Primary Care Research Networks for London, Derby, and Nottingham. Patients aged ≥65 years were identified by searches of computerised medical records and invited to participate by letter from their GP.&quot;</span> 

Score: [4] Recruitment is done through primary care practices, which is moderately pragmatic as this is where most older patients receive care. Patients are identified from medical records and invited by letter, which requires some additional effort beyond usual care. Overall, recruitment methods are more pragmatic than explanatory.

Setting
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;A three-arm, parallel-design cluster controlled trial was used, with allocation at the level of general practice in two centres (London and Nottingham/Derby).&quot;</span>

Score: [4] The trial is conducted in a primary care setting, which matches usual care. Using multiple centers increases generalizability. Overall, the setting is pragmatic.

Organisation
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The FaME intervention took place in a group once a week and included exercises to be carried out at home, unsupervised, twice weekly. The OEP was undertaken at home, unsupervised, and comprised exercises to be done three times per week.&quot;</span>

Score: [4] The interventions utilize existing primary care staff and resources. Some training is provided, but not substantially beyond usual care. The organization is moderately pragmatic.

Flexibility: delivery
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Volunteer peer mentors supported participants in the OEP arm, and weekly FaME classes were run in local venues by postural stability instructors trained to work with older people.&quot;</span>

Score: [3] There is some flexibility in delivery of the home OEP program but the FaME class intervention is more standardized. Overall, flexibility in delivery is moderately pragmatic.

Flexibility: adherence 
Quote: No relevant quotes.

Score: [NA] Adherence is not discussed.

Follow-up
Quote: <span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 99.5%):

Participants were followed up every 6 months after the end of the intervention period, until 24 months. The primary time point was chosen as 12 months postintervention to match other trials.' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;Participants were followed up every 6 months after the end of the intervention period, until 24 months. The primary time point was chosen as 12 months post-intervention to match other trials.&quot;</span>

Score: [3] Follow-up is more frequent than usual care but not excessively burdensome. The approach is moderately pragmatic.

Primary outcome
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The primary outcome was the proportion of participants who reported reaching ≥150 minutes of MVPA per week.&quot;</span> 

Score: [5] The primary outcome of physical activity level is highly relevant to participants and matches guidelines. This is a pragmatic choice.

Primary analysis
Quote: No analysis plan is provided.

Score: [NA] Analysis approach is not specified.</pre>

Here are the PRECIS-2 domain scores and explanations for the given clinical trial text:

Eligibility criteria:

Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants were included who scored >2 on the General Health Questionnaire 12, a measure of psychological distress, or >7 on the anxiety and depression subscales of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, thus confirming they had low mood.&quot;</span>

The eligibility criteria are focused on including patients with confirmed low mood based on validated questionnaires. This is more selective than simply including all patients with MS who may present with low mood symptoms in usual care.

Score: [2] Rather explanatory

Recruitment:

Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants were recruited for a randomized trial of adjustment groups for people with multiple sclerosis and low mood between June 2008 and September 2009.&quot;</span>

No details are provided on how participants were recruited, but it seems they were specifically recruited for this trial rather than identified during routine clinic visits. Extra effort was likely made to identify and recruit eligible patients.

Score: [2] Rather explanatory 

Setting: 

No quotes. The setting is not described.

Score: [NA]

Organisation:

Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The groups were delivered by two Band 5 assistant psychologists, who were supervised by a Band 8a clinical psychologist, experienced in working with people with multiple sclerosis.&quot;</span>

The intervention requires trained psychologists to deliver, which provides more resources and expertise than would be available in usual care.

Score: [2] Rather explanatory

Flexibility of experimental intervention - delivery:

Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The groups involved teaching people to recognise symptoms of distress and introduced them to strategies to improve their mood.&quot;</span>

The intervention is a structured 6 session group program, which is more rigid than typical psychological care that would be individualized.

Score: [2] Rather explanatory

Flexibility of experimental intervention - adherence: 

No relevant quotes. Adherence is not discussed.

Score: [NA]

Follow-up:

Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Four and eight months after random allocation, participants were sent a booklet of outcome questionnaires to complete and return by post.&quot;</span>

Follow-up is more frequent and involves more assessments than would occur in usual care.

Score: [2] Rather explanatory

Primary outcome:

Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Effectiveness was initially defined as the change in EQ-5D scores and a cost-effectiveness analysis was performed using this outcome measure. In addition, reductions in the BDI-II score from baseline to follow-up were analysed as an alternative measure of the cost effectiveness.&quot;</span>

The EQ-5D is a generic quality of life measure and the BDI-II measures depression severity. These are relevant but not patient-centered outcomes.

Score: [3] Equally pragmatic and explanatory

Primary analysis:

No quotes. Analysis method is not described.

<pre>
Here are the PRECIS-2 domain scores and explanations for the given clinical trial text:

1. Eligibility criteria

Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The inclusion criteria were being definitely diagnosed with MS and having records in the Society and the exclusion criteria having history of other psychiatric disorders including major depressive disorder (according to the medical records and the physician's examinations) or bipolar disorder (except for cognitive disorders by which MS is characterized), substance dependency, any neurological disorders, history of taking corticosteroids or the disease recurrence within the previous six months.&quot;</span>

Explanation: The eligibility criteria are moderately pragmatic as patients with a confirmed diagnosis of MS are included, which is similar to usual care. However, patients with major psychiatric disorders are excluded, which limits the generalizability. 

Score: [3]

2. Recruitment

Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Because the patients were not hospitalized and regularly referred to the Association, to follow randomized assignment, we decided to run the sampling within two consecutive months until we enrolled an adequate number of participants.&quot;</span>

Explanation: Participants seem to be recruited through routine clinic visits rather than any special efforts like advertisements or incentives. This matches usual care.

Score: [4] 

3. Setting

Quote: <span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 98.2%):

This clinical trial was conducted in 2015e2016 and registered as IRCT2014112420064N1 in the Iranian Register of Clinical Trials. The study population consists the patients referring to the Multiple Sclerosis Society of Isfahan.' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;This study was conducted in 2015e2016 and registered as IRCT2014112420064N1 in the Iranian Register of Clinical Trials. The study population consists the patients referring to the Multiple Sclerosis Society of Isfahan.&quot;</span>

Explanation: The setting is a MS society clinic, which is likely where patients would receive care in usual practice. 

Score: [4]

4. Organization

Quote: No relevant quotes.

Explanation: The text does not mention any differences in staffing, training, resources etc. compared to usual care.

Score: [NA]

5. Flexibility: Delivery

Quote: No relevant quotes. 

Explanation: The text does not provide any details on how flexibly the intervention was delivered.

Score: [NA]

6. Flexibility: Adherence 

Quote: No relevant quotes.

Explanation: The text does not mention any measures to enforce or monitor adherence.

Score: [NA] 

7. Follow-up

Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;To assess the reliability of the instruments used in this study, split-half reliability was used. Pearson's correlation coefficient was estimated to be 0.79 and 0.89 for the half of the DASS-21 and the Piper Standard Scale, respectively.&quot;</span>

Explanation: Follow-up seems limited to outcome assessments at a few time points, similar to usual care.

Score: [4]

8. Primary outcome  

Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;To investigate depression, anxiety, and stress, DASS-21, developed by Lovibond and Lovibond in 1995, was used and its validity and reliability were confirmed [17]. To measure fatigue, the Piper Standard Scale was used.&quot;</span>

Explanation: The primary outcomes of depression, anxiety, stress and fatigue are clinically meaningful to patients.

Score: [5] 

9. Primary analysis

Quote: No relevant quotes.

Explanation: The text does not provide details on the primary analysis.

Here are the PRECIS-2 domain scores and explanations for the given clinical trial text:

Eligibility criteria:

Quotes:
<span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 97.6%):

Persons with MS (N ¼ 183) with cognitive concerns were randomly assigned to either the 8week MAPSS-MS intervention or usual care plus freely available computer games.' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;Persons with MS (N 1⁄4 183) with cognitive concerns were randomly assigned to either the 8-week MAPSS-MS intervention or usual care plus freely available computer games.&quot;</span>

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The Perceived Deficits Questionnaire was administered by phone, and those scoring at least 10 (indicating some problems in at least 5 areas) were eligible to participate.&quot;</span>

Explanation: The trial included people with MS who had subjective cognitive concerns, as assessed by the Perceived Deficits Questionnaire. No other major exclusions were mentioned. This seems reasonably similar to patients who would receive this intervention in usual practice.

Score: [4] Rather pragmatic

Recruitment:

Quotes:  
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants were recruited via physician referral, targeted mailings to persons with MS on the mailing list of the National MS Society, contact with support groups, and notices in MS newsletters and web sites.&quot;</span>

Explanation: Participants were recruited through multiple routes including physician referral, MS Society contacts, and support groups. This seems like a moderately pragmatic approach using some recruitment methods that would occur in usual practice.

Score: [3] Equally pragmatic and explanatory  

Setting: 

Quotes:
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Following approval by the Institutional Review Board for the University of Texas at Austin, participants were recruited from three large metropolitan communities in Texas: Houston, San Antonio and Dallas.&quot;</span>

Explanation: The trial was conducted across multiple sites in three major cities in Texas. This seems reasonably similar to the settings where the intervention would be delivered in usual practice.

Score: [4] Rather pragmatic

Organization:

Quotes: 
No relevant quotes.

Explanation: The text does not provide information about resources, expertise, or care organization.

Score: [NA] 

Flexibility of experimental intervention - Delivery:

Quotes: 
No relevant quotes.

Explanation: The text does not provide information about flexibility in how the intervention was delivered. 

Score: [NA]

Flexibility of experimental intervention - Adherence:

Quotes:
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The facilitator prescribed exercises from a study-specific protocol addressing the most common deficits experienced by persons with MS (attention, memory, flexibility, and problem solving). The games/tasks were arranged so that the most basic cognitive skills (attention) were addressed first.&quot;</span>

Explanation: There was a prescribed protocol for the computer exercises targeting specific cognitive deficits. This reduces flexibility in how participants adhere to the intervention.

Score: [2] Rather explanatory

Follow-up:

Quotes:  
<span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 95.1%):

Neuropsychological testing and questionnaire data were collected from all subjects at baseline, following completion of the intervention, and 3 and 6 months post-intervention.' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;Neuropsychological testing and questionnaire data were collected from all subjects at baseline, following completion of the MAPSS-MS intervention, and 3 and 6 months post-intervention.&quot;</span>

Explanation: Follow-up data collection occurred at baseline, post-intervention, 3 months, and 6 months. This intensity of measurement seems greater than would occur in usual care.

Score: [2] Rather explanatory

Primary outcome:

Quotes:
<span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 99.6%):

The primary purpose of this study was to determine the effectiveness of a novel computerassisted cognitive rehabilitation intervention MAPSS-MS (Memory, Attention, Problem Solving Skills in MS) in a multi-site trial with persons with MS.' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;The primary purpose of this study was to determine the effectiveness of a novel computer-assisted cognitive rehabilitation intervention MAPSS-MS (Memory, Attention, Problem Solving Skills in MS) in a multi-site trial with persons with MS.&quot;</span> 

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Cognitive performance outcomes: Five neuropsychological tests from the Minimal Assessment of Cognitive Function in MS (MACFIMS), were used to measure cognitive performance.&quot;</span>

Explanation: The primary outcomes were performance on neuropsychological tests of cognitive functioning. These are relevant but indirect outcomes for participants.

Score: [3] Equally pragmatic and explanatory

Primary analysis:

Quotes: 
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Missing data are often problematic for randomized controlled trials and various strategies are used to manage missing data. For the current study, we employed intention-to-treat strategies to handle missing data using a “last observation carried forward” (LOCF) strategy in which missing data points are imputed based on the participant's existing data.&quot;</span>

Explanation: An intention-to-treat approach was used with last observation carried forward imputation for missing data. This is a reasonably pragmatic analysis.

Here are the PRECIS-2 domain scores and explanations for the given full text:

1. Eligibility criteria 
Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Inclusion criteria were (1) 18–60 years of age, (2) ⩽2 years since clinical diagnosis with relapsing remitting MS (RRMS) and (3) no relapses or changes in medication status 8 weeks prior to inclusion.&quot;</span>
- <span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Exclusion criteria—Pregnancy, breast feeding, uncontrolled diabetes, peptic ulcer disease, suppurative otitis media, herpes zoster, multiple sclerosis, systematic infection, sarcoidosis and other rare conditions, and an inability to provide informed consent.&quot;</span>

Score: [2] Rather explanatory

The eligibility criteria are quite restrictive, excluding patients with many comorbidities as well as pregnant women and those unable to consent, who would likely receive the intervention in usual care. The inclusion of only RRMS patients and restricting to those with recent diagnosis makes the sample less representative.

2. Recruitment
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Patients were recruited in collaboration with six Danish regional MS clinics and The Danish MS Society.&quot;</span>

Score: [4] Rather pragmatic 

Patients were recruited through usual clinics, although some effort from the MS Society was used to aid recruitment. Overall, recruitment seems moderately pragmatic.

3. Setting
Quote: <span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 99.6%):

The present study is a national multicentre singleblinded parallel group randomized controlled trial (RCT) comparing two groups receiving either supervised exercise therapy (intervention group) or health education (active control group).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;The present study is a national multicentre single-blinded parallel group randomized controlled trial (RCT) comparing two groups receiving either supervised exercise therapy (intervention group) or health education (active control group).&quot;</span>

Score: [5] Very pragmatic

The multicenter design across regional clinics makes the setting very representative of usual care.

4. Organization
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Patients received the exercise intervention in addition to usual care.&quot;</span> 

Score: [5] Very pragmatic

The exercise intervention was provided in addition to usual care, with no changes to expertise or resources.

5. Flexibility: delivery
Quote: NA

Score: [NA]

No information provided on flexibility of delivery.

6. Flexibility: adherence 
Quote: NA 

Score: [NA] 

No information provided on flexibility of adherence.

7. Follow-up
Quotes:  
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The study period covers 48 weeks with outcome assessment at baseline (T0), after 24 weeks (T24), and after 48 weeks (T48).&quot;</span>
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;All patients were scanned using the exact same 3-Tesla MRI scanner (MAGNETOM Skyra, Siemens Medical Systems, Erlangen, Germany) at the same location, for all patients, and at all timepoints.&quot;</span>

Score: [2] Rather explanatory

Follow-up was much more extensive than usual care, with multiple study visits for outcomes assessment and MRI scans.

8. Primary outcome
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The relapse rate and the global brain atrophy rate were the primary outcomes of this study.&quot;</span>

Score: [4] Rather pragmatic

Relapse rate and brain atrophy are clinically meaningful outcomes, although brain atrophy is a surrogate measure.

9. Primary analysis
Quote: NA

Score: [NA] 

No details provided on primary analysis.</pre>

<pre>
Here are the PRECIS-2 domain scores and explanations for the given clinical trial text:

1. Eligibility criteria 

Quote: <span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 99.6%):

inclusion criteria were: males and females; age 18 to 70; diagnosis of MS (primary or secondary progressive, relapsing-remitting), without relapses in the preceding three months and an Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score between 4 and 5.5' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;Inclusion criteria—Males and females; age 18 to 70; diagnosis of MS (primary or secondary progressive, relapsing-remitting), without relapses in the preceding three months and an Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score between 4 and 5.5.&quot;</span>

The eligibility criteria are reasonably broad, including adults up to age 70 with different types of MS, as long as they have an EDSS score between 4-5.5. However, excluding those with relapses in the past 3 months makes it slightly less pragmatic.

Score: [3] Equally pragmatic and explanatory 

2. Recruitment

Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Patients have been recruited at Ferrara University Hospital from patients who attend the Rehabilitation Outpatient Clinic for gait rehabilitation.&quot;</span>

Recruitment is done at a single hospital site, from patients already attending the clinic for gait rehabilitation. This recruitment approach is more pragmatic than mailing invitations or advertising, but less pragmatic than recruiting all eligible patients at multiple sites.

Score: [3] Equally pragmatic and explanatory

3. Setting

Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Patients have been recruited at Ferrara University Hospital from patients who attend the Rehabilitation Outpatient Clinic for gait rehabilitation.&quot;</span> 

The trial is conducted at a single hospital site. This is less pragmatic than a multicenter trial across different settings.

Score: [2] Rather explanatory

4. Organization

Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;One session included up to three patients and lasted 120 min, five days/week for two weeks.&quot;</span>

The intervention is delivered by existing clinic staff as part of standard rehabilitation sessions. No additional resources or training are mentioned. This matches usual care.

Score: [4] Rather pragmatic

5. Flexibility: Delivery

Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;During TOCT, they received feedback (visual and auditory) from the physiotherapist.&quot;</span>

The protocol provides guidance on delivering the intervention but allows flexibility for the physiotherapist. This matches usual care.

Score: [4] Rather pragmatic

6. Flexibility: Adherence

No relevant quotes. The text does not mention any special measures to enforce adherence.

Score: [4] Rather pragmatic 

7. Follow-up

Quote: <span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 99.6%):

The blind evaluator, who did not supervise the training program, performed functional tests, questionnaires and instrumental measurements the week before treatment, the week after the end of the supervised-TOCT, after the 12-weeks home-based TOCT program' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;The blind evaluator, who did not supervise the training program, performed functional tests, questionnaires and instrumental measurements the week before treatment, the week after the end of the supervised-TOCT, after the 12-weeks home-based TOCT program.&quot;</span>

Follow-up schedule matches the intervention periods. No more frequent follow-up than usual care is mentioned.

Score: [4] Rather pragmatic

8. Primary outcome

Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The primary outcome measure was the 6-minute walking test (6MWT) for walking endurance.&quot;</span>

The 6MWT is a patient-centered outcome directly relevant to walking ability.

Score: [5] Very pragmatic

9. Primary analysis

Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;An intention-to-treat analysis was carried out on all outcome measures, handling missing data (n = 2 at T1, n = 7 at T2) with the last observation carried forward approach.&quot;</span>

An intention-to-treat analysis is used, with no exclusions. This is very pragmatic.

The eligibility criteria are quite restrictive, excluding patients outside a narrow age range, those without a confirmed diagnosis, pregnant/lactating women, and patients who have not received interferon recently. This reduces the similarity of trial participants to real-world patients.

Score: [2] Rather explanatory

Recruitment:

Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The total sample volume was 90 patients divided into three equal groups.&quot;</span> 

No details are provided on how patients were recruited, so it is unclear if any special effort was made beyond what would occur in usual care.

Score: [NA] 

Setting:

The trial was conducted at a single center, which limits generalizability. 

Score: [2] Rather explanatory

Organization: 

No relevant quotes. The text does not mention if additional expertise, training, or resources were provided beyond usual care.

Score: [NA]

Flexibility of delivery:

No relevant quotes. The text does not describe if flexibility was allowed in how the intervention was delivered.

Score: [NA] 

Flexibility of adherence:

No relevant quotes. The text does not mention any measures to enforce or improve adherence.

Score: [NA]

Follow-up:

Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The patients in all three groups were evaluated at the end of months 6, 12, 18, 24 and in case of development of reactions were excluded from the study.&quot;</span>

Patients were followed more closely than usual care, with evaluations every 6 months. 

Score: [2] Rather explanatory

Primary outcome:

Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;At the end of 24 months the patients were again evaluated for EDSS, and the number of relapses for each patient was calculated&quot;</span>

The EDSS disability scale is clinically relevant for MS patients.

Here are the PRECIS-2 domain assessments for the given full text:

Eligibility criteria:

Relevant quotes:

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Patients with multiple sclerosis were randomly selected into treated and control groups; only patients who could walk with or without walking aids were admitted to the trial, and these cases were initially assessed and scored during an inactive phase of the disease.&quot;</span>

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Patients with diabetes mellitus or hypertension or who gave a history of psychiatric illness or peptic ulcer were not admitted to the treated group.&quot;</span> 

Reasoning: The trial selected patients with multiple sclerosis who could walk, excluding those with comorbidities that would preclude corticotrophin treatment. This matches usual care eligibility reasonably closely.

Score: [4]

Recruitment:

Relevant quotes:

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;In Manchester, patients who had relapsed in the previous eighteen months only were admitted to the trial.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: Patients were recruited during routine clinic visits, with an additional restriction at one site to select patients with recent relapse. Overall, recruitment matches usual care.

Score: [4] 

Setting:

Relevant quotes:

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;To obtain an adequate number of cases for statistical purposes similar studies were carried out at the same time in three cities and this had the added advantage that they could&quot;</span>control<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;one another.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial was conducted across multiple hospitals in different cities, increasing generalizability.

Score: [5]

Organisation:

Relevant quotes:

No relevant quotes.

Reasoning: No details provided on resources, staffing, training, or facilities. Likely similar to usual care but unclear.

Score: [NA]

Flexibility (delivery): 

Relevant quotes:

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The treated group were given corticotrophin (’Acthar’ gel) in a dosage which varied between 15 and 25 units daily, potassium chloride orally, and a low-salt diet.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The intervention dosage and delivery protocol was specified but allows some flexibility in corticotrophin dose. Likely moderately flexible compared to usual care.

Score: [3]

Flexibility (adherence):

Relevant quotes: 

No relevant quotes.

Reasoning: No details provided on measures to enforce or encourage adherence. Likely similar to usual care but unclear.

Score: [NA]

Follow-up:

Relevant quotes:

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;All cases were seen at three-monthly intervals and scored on the Kurtzke (1961) scale; relapses lasting longer than twenty-four hours were also scored by a system in the three centres.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: Follow-up visits every 3 months are more frequent than usual care.

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Patients with contraindications to bed rest or ACTH-treatment, such as hypersensitivity to ACTH, acute infections, cardial insufficiency, psychosis, pregnancy, Cushing syndrome or peptic ulcer, were excluded.&quot;</span>

The eligibility criteria are quite restrictive, excluding many patients who would be eligible for ACTH treatment in usual care. The Poser criteria require extensive testing not routinely done, and many common conditions exclude patients beyond typical contraindications.

Score: [2]

Recruitment:

Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Three neurological departments in the Netherlands (University Hospital Groningen, Streekziekenhuis Almelo, Diaconessenhuis Meppel) participated in this study.&quot;</span>

Patients were recruited from specialized neurological departments, which is more explanatory than recruiting from primary care or general neurology clinics where most MS patients receive care.

Score: [2] 

Setting: 

Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Three neurological departments in the Netherlands (University Hospital Groningen, Streekziekenhuis Almelo, Diaconessenhuis Meppel) participated in this study.&quot;</span>

Conducting the trial in specialized neurological departments makes the setting more explanatory compared to general neurology clinics.

Score: [2]

Organization:

No relevant quotes.

The paper does not mention any differences in expertise, resources, or care delivery compared to usual care.

Score: [NA]

Flexibility (delivery):

Quote: <span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 99.7%):

Patients were allocated in a stratified randomisation to treatment with either bed rest during 3 weeks and a synthetic ACTH depotpreparation (1 mg, 100 units, tapered over 12 weeks), and Vitamin B-complex or bed rest and Vitamin B-complex intramuscular injections in the same scheme (5)' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;Patients were allocated in a stratified randomisation to treatment with either bed rest during 3 weeks and a synthetic ACTH depotpreparation (1 mg, 100 units, tapered over 12 weeks), and Vitamin B-complex or bed rest and Vitamin B-complex intramuscular injections in the same scheme (5).&quot;</span>

The ACTH regimen is highly specified and protocolized, indicating low flexibility in delivery.

Score: [2]

Flexibility (adherence): 

No relevant quotes.

The paper does not mention any strategies to enforce or monitor adherence.

Score: [NA] 

Follow-up:

Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Follow-up was performed in the 6th and 12th week of treatment and 6, 9, and 12 months after the start of treatment.&quot;</span>

Patients were followed more frequently than usual care, up to 12 months after starting treatment.

Primary outcome:

Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Assessment included: EDSS, FS, AI, ISS, in the 6th and 12th week an overall impression by both the patient and the neurologist in a 7-point scale (from much worse via unchanged to much better), and on a 3-point scale (worse, unchanged, better) in the 6th, 9th and 12th month.&quot;</span>

Outcomes like EDSS, FS, and AI are physician-assessed and not patient-centered. The overall impression scales are more pragmatic but still quite subjective.

Here are the PRECIS-2 domain scores and explanations for the given clinical trial text:

1. Eligibility criteria

Quote: <span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 99.1%):

a Men and women aged 18–65 years with relapsing forms of MS, as defined by the 2005 revised McDonald criteria [14], and an Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) Calkwood et al. BMC Neurology 2014, 14:220 Page 2 of 11 http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2377/14/220 score of 0–5.5 were eligible to participate in the stud' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;Men and women aged 18–65 years with relapsing forms of MS, as defined by the 2005 revised McDonald criteria, and an Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score of 0–5.5 were eligible to participate in the study.&quot;</span>

Explanation: The eligibility criteria include adult men and women with relapsing-remitting MS based on standard diagnostic criteria, with mild to moderate disability levels. This seems reasonably inclusive and similar to patients who would receive fingolimod in clinical practice.

Score: [4] Rather pragmatic

2. Recruitment

Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Patients were required to have received a single iDMT (except natalizumab) continuously for at least 6 months prior to study initiation and to be candidates for therapy change.&quot;</span> 

Explanation: Participants were recruited from those already receiving an injectable DMT and identified by their physician as candidates for a therapy switch. This recruitment approach through standard clinic visits and referrals mirrors clinical practice.

Score: [5] Very pragmatic  

3. Setting

Explanation: The trial was conducted across multiple study centers, suggesting a range of standard clinical settings where fingolimod would be used. This matches the intended real-world application.

Score: [5] Very pragmatic

4. Organization

Quote: None relevant

Explanation: No details are provided on resources, expertise, or care delivery model.

Score: [NA] 

5. Flexibility: Delivery

Quote: None relevant

Explanation: No details are provided on flexibility in how fingolimod was delivered. 

Score: [NA]

6. Flexibility: Adherence

Quote: None relevant 

Explanation: No details are provided on measures to ensure participant adherence.

Score: [NA]

7. Follow-up

Quote: None relevant

Explanation: No details are provided on follow-up intensity or frequency.

Score: [NA]

8. Primary outcome  

Quote: <span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 98.7%):

Explanation: The primary outcome measured patient satisfaction with treatment, which is clinically meaningful to patients.

Score: [5] Very pragmatic

9. Primary analysis

Here are the PRECIS-2 domain scores and explanations for the given full text:

1. Eligibility criteria

Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Inclusion criteria—Patients with confirmed diagnosis: ≥16 years of age with unilateral facial nerve weakness of no identifiable cause who presented to primary care or an emergency department and could be referred to a collaborating otorhinolaryngologist <72 hours after the onset of symptoms.&quot;</span>

Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Exclusion criteria—Pregnancy, breast feeding, uncontrolled diabetes, peptic ulcer disease, suppurative otitis media, herpes zoster, multiple sclerosis, systematic infection, sarcoidosis and other rare conditions, and an inability to provide informed consent.&quot;</span> 

Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Extra test—Randomised controlled trial of Bell’s palsy treatment required senior otorhinolaryngologist in hospitals to confirm a patient’s eligibility to participate. Bell’s palsy is usually diagnosed by a general practitioner in primary care.&quot;</span>

The eligibility criteria are quite restrictive, with many exclusions that would not occur in usual care. The extra test by a specialist is also not routine practice. This makes the trial less pragmatic.

Score: [2] Rather explanatory

2. Recruitment

No relevant quotes found. The full text does not provide information on how participants were recruited.

Score: [NA] 

3. Setting

Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Single centre and specialised centre (Madigan Army Medical Center, USA), unlikely to be the usual setting for most individuals receiving physiotherapy for shoulder impingement.&quot;</span>

The trial was conducted at a single specialized center, which is different from the usual care setting. This reduces pragmatism.

Score: [2] Rather explanatory

4. Organization

No relevant quotes found. The full text does not provide information on trial organization. 

Score: [NA]

5. Flexibility: Delivery

No relevant quotes found. The full text does not provide information on flexibility in delivery of the intervention.

Score: [NA]

6. Flexibility: Adherence 

No relevant quotes found. The full text does not provide information on flexibility in adherence.

Score: [NA]

7. Follow-up

Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Clinical follow-up until patient left hospital (discharge or death) or until 30 days after surgery, whichever was the longer, so more than usual care.&quot;</span>

Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Monitoring intensity involved more extensive data collection than usual: Pre-operation—three-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) Holter monitor (Flashcard with 2×48 hour recording) set up on each patient and maintained for 72 hours. Troponin values at 1, 3, and 7 days after surgery (more usual for only 1 and 3 days after surgery) ECG after randomisation and at 7 and 30 days after surgery.&quot;</span>

Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Unscheduled follow-up visits triggered by primary outcome: a cardiovascular event (such as angina, myocardial infarction, stroke)&quot;</span>

The trial had more frequent and longer follow-up than usual care, with additional data collection. This makes it more explanatory.

Score: [2] Rather explanatory

8. Primary outcome

Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Primary outcome—Recovery of facial function as rated on the House-Brackmann scale.&quot;</span> 

Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Test not routinely used in primary care and requires training. It is, however, an easy clinical test widely used in secondary care for grading recovery from facial nerve paralysis caused by damage to lower motor neurons.&quot;</span>

Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Central adjudication—Photographs taken of patients were assessed and graded independently by a panel of three experts (not general practitioners, who usually assess).&quot;</span>

The primary outcome measure is not routinely used in the usual care setting and requires specialist training and central adjudication. This reduces pragmatism.  

Score: [2] Rather explanatory

How to use PRECIS-2 - Designing trials that are fit for purpose
We think there are four steps to using PRECIS-2, which may be iterative depending on what you
discover after going through the steps.
Step 1: Why are you doing your trial?
Your first step is to be clear about why you are doing your trial. Are you:
1. Aiming to take an explanatory approach to answer the question ‘Can this
intervention work under ideal conditions?’
2. Aiming to take a pragmatic approach and answer the question ‘Does this
intervention work under usual conditions?’
Both approaches to trial design have their place but trialists should be clear which path they are on.
As Schwartz and Lellouch pointed out, trialists have often taken the first approach by default rather
than as a considered judgement.
Step 2: Consider your trial design choices for each of the nine PRECIS-2 domains
This step is explained in more detail for each domain later on.
Step 3: Score 1 to 5 for these choices made in Step 2 and/or mark on the PRECIS-2 wheel
Having considered your design choices in Step 2, the PRECIS-2 wheel is used to record how
pragmatic or explanatory these choices are for each domain. Each domain is a 5-point Likert scale:
1. Very explanatory
2. Rather explanatory
3. Equally pragmatic/explanatory
4. Rather pragmatic
5. Very pragmatic
A table can be used in conjunction with the PRECIS “wheel” or instead of the wheel to give rationale
for scores. You can use this to assist discussion with trial collaborators.
Step 4: Review your PRECIS-2 wheel
Review your design choices (Step 2) on the PRECIS-2 wheel to see whether they will produce a trial
that will support the aim identified in Step 1. Go back to Step 2 and modify your design choices if
required.

The PRECIS-2 Domains
The NINE PRECIS-2 domains are:
 Eligibility –to what extent are the participants in the trial similar to those who would receive this
intervention if it was part of usual care? For example, score 5 for very pragmatic criteria
essentially identical to those in usual care; score 1 for a very explanatory approach with lots of
exclusions (e.g. those who don’t comply, respond to treatment, or are not at high risk for
primary outcome, are children or elderly), or uses many selection tests not used in usual care.
 Recruitment - how much extra effort is made to recruit participants over and above what that
would be used in the usual care setting to engage with patients? For example, score 5 for very
pragmatic recruitment through usual appointments or clinic; score 1 for a very explanatory
approach with targeted invitation letters, advertising in newspapers, radio plus incentives and
other routes that would not be used in usual care.
 Setting – how different is the setting of the trial and the usual care setting? For example, score 5
for a very pragmatic choice using identical settings to usual care; score 1, for a very explanatory
approach with only a single centre, or only specialised trial or academic centres.
 Organisation – how different are the resources, provider expertise and the organisation of care
delivery in the intervention arm of the trial and those available in usual care? For example, score
5 for a very pragmatic choice that uses identical organisation to usual care; score 1 for a very
explanatory approach if the trial increases staff levels, gives additional training, require more
than usual experience or certification and increase resources.
 Flexibility (delivery) – how different is the flexibility in how the intervention is delivered and the
flexibility likely in usual care? For example, score 5 for a very pragmatic choice with identical
flexibility to usual care; score 1 for a very explanatory approach if there is a strict protocol,
monitoring and measures to improve compliance, with specific advice on allowed co-
interventions and complications.
 Flexibility (adherence) - how different is the flexibility in how participants must adhere to the
intervention and the flexibility likely in usual care? For example, score 5 for a very pragmatic
choice involving no more than usual encouragement to adhere to the intervention; score 1 for a
very explanatory approach that involves exclusion based on adherence, and measures to
improve adherence if found wanting. In some trials eg surgical trials where patients are being
operated on or Intensive Care Unit trials where patients are being given IV drug therapy, this
domain is not applicable as there is no compliance issue after consent has been given, so this
score should be left blank.
 Follow-up - how different is the intensity of measurement and follow-up of participants in the
trial and the likely follow-up in usual care? For example, score 5 for a very pragmatic approach
with no more than usual follow up; score 1 for a very explanatory approach with more frequent,
longer visits, unscheduled visits triggered by primary outcome event or intervening event, and
more extensive data collection.
 Primary outcome – to what extent is the trial's primary outcome relevant to participants? For
example, score 5 for a very pragmatic choice where the outcome is of obvious importance to
participants; score 1 for a very explanatory approach using a surrogate, physiological outcome,
central adjudication or use assessment expertise that is not available in usual care, or the
outcome is measured at an earlier time than in usual care.
 Primary analysis – to what extent are all data included in the analysis of the primary outcome?
For example, score 5 for a very pragmatic approach using intention to treat with all available
data; score 1 for a very explanatory analysis that excludes ineligible post-randomisation
participants, includes only completers or those following the treatment protocol.

Notes
“Participants" include patients or other individual recipients of an intervention, and/or providers of
the intervention. This may include individual participants and/or one or more levels of clusters. For
example, in a trial of a continuing education intervention, participants may be health professionals
and trained instructors and the trial may be randomised into clusters at the level of the instructor.
During the design process, if there is uncertainty over how explanatory or pragmatic a domain is,
then we suggest the score for this domain should be left blank. This will then highlight uncertainty
and encourage discussion. If PRECIS-2 is used to look at how pragmatic included trials are in
systematic reviews then a score of 3 may be chosen if there is inadequate information. This is
different to the “3 = equally pragmatic/explanatory”.

Table – PRECIS-2 scores for trial domains
Domain Score Rationale
1 Eligibility Criteria 5 
Patients ≥ 3 with acute respiratory tract infections. Exclusions not common cold but severe respiratory tract infections,
peptic ulcer and asthma. But even asthma patients who were not sensitive to ibuprofen or aspirin eligible. Pregnant or
breast feeding women are discouraged from taking ibuprofen when pregnant but can take as low a dose as possible of
Paracetemol but as both being tested in the trial cannot include this group as participants. If include visually impaired
increase organisation of trial (as in carers have to assist diary completion) but that would be norm and usual if
prescribed ibuprofen or Paracetemol or steam treatment in usual care, so just easier for trialists to exclude. Small
proportion of participants – so why exclude? Depressed and people with psychosis unreliable diary fillers, concerned
with other things.
2 Recruitment Path 5 
Patients presenting to GP or nurse in primary care with respiratory tract infections as diagnosed by health professional.
Easy to recruit to but time pressures in busy winter clinics prevented recruitment and meant non-recruitments logs
poorly completed.
3 Setting 5 Identical setting to usual care setting - primary care where patients usually go for advice and treatment.
4 
Organisation
intervention
3 
Information sheets given out to participants. This is not usual practice, would it be if trial had shown this helped? Need
more staff for follow up of trial participants to get diary results so more extensive data collection than usual. Otherwise
no difference in provider expertise and organisation of care delivery.

6 
Flex of experimental
intervention –
Adherence
5 
Compliance measured with diary – “reasonably good” participants free to “not-comply” with advice. Little impact of
advising patients to take analgesics regularly. No measures to improve compliance
7 Follow up 2 Participants Followed up one month – usual care no follow up. Patients come back to GP if problems.
Trial more extensive data colleaction - patients telephoned day two to three to check for any problems with diary
completion. If no diary after 2 weeks then mailed reminder and then phoned as necessary to document outcomes using
validated questionnaire.
8 Outcome 5 
Very relevant to participants - Mean symptom severity on days 2-4. Symptoms 0 (no problem) to 6 (as bad as they can
be 7 in abstract). Completed in diary at end of day – children with parents or participants.
9 Analysis 5 ITT no matter whether compliance.

For each of the 9 domains of PRECIS-2, perform the following steps:

1. Extract 1-3 relevant quotes from the full text.

2. Explain your reasoning in 1 paragraph.

3. Give a score X from 1 (very explanatory) to 5 (very pragmatic) in square brackets like this: "Score: [X]". If the full text does not contain enough information to assess a specific domain, report "Score: [NA]".

Do not provide a final summary paragraph in the end.
