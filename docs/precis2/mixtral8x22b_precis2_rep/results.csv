Reasoning: The follow-up intensity in this trial appears to be relatively explanatory, as all patients underwent MRI scans at specific timepoints using the same scanner. This suggests that the trial is focused on collecting detailed data on the effects of the intervention.

Score: [2]

8. Primary outcome:
Quote: ""The relapse rate and the global brain atrophy rate were the primary outcomes of this study.""

Reasoning: The primary outcome of this trial is relatively pragmatic, as it focuses on clinically relevant outcomes such as relapse rate and brain atrophy. These outcomes are likely to be of importance to patients and clinicians.

* Quote: ""Each regional coordinator (one per country, except India, which was split into two regions) started and documented a training programme that ensured that surgeons operating within the trial were familiar with the techniques being compared before participating.""
* Quote: ""The procedures for blunt versus sharp abdominal entry were as follows. For sharp entry, the abdomen was entered using a scalpel to divide the abdominal skin. Each subsequent layer of the abdomen was then separately identified and divided using either a scalpel or scissors. In blunt entry, the abdomen was entered using a scalpel to divide the abdominal skin. The scalpel was then used to divide the fat and rectus sheath in the midline and the rectus sheath incision extended manually. The parietal peritoneum was then entered digitally and the defect enlarged manually.""
* Reasoning: The trial ensured that surgeons were familiar with the techniques being compared before participating in the trial. The procedures for blunt versus sharp abdominal entry were described in detail, suggesting that the trial aimed to standardize the procedures as much as possible. However, the trial did not provide information on the resources, provider expertise, and organization of care delivery in the intervention arm compared to usual care.

Quote: ""Primary outcomes were fatigue severity (Global Fatigue Severity (GFS) subscale of the Fatigue Assessment Instrument (FAI)), (18) disease-specific quality of life (QOL) (total score on the Multiple Sclerosis Impact Scale, V.1 (MSIS-29, V.1)) (19) and self-efficacy for managing fatigue (Multiple Sclerosis-Fatigue Self-Efficacy scale—adapted from the Control subscale of the MS Self-Efficacy scale). (20)""
Reasoning: The trial used primary outcomes that are relevant to patients with MS, including fatigue severity, disease-specific quality of life, and self-efficacy for managing fatigue. This suggests a pragmatic approach to the choice of primary outcome, as it reflects the outcomes that are important to patients with MS.

1. Primary analysis:
Quote: ""The main analysis was intention-to-treat but we also conducted a ‘per protocol’ analysis (excluding participants who attended fewer than four FACETS sessions).""
Reasoning: The trial used an intention-to-treat analysis, which is a pragmatic approach to data analysis that includes all randomized participants in the analysis. However, the trial also conducted a per-protocol analysis, which is a more explanatory approach that excludes participants who did not adhere to the intervention protocol.

Reasoning: The trial uses intention-to-treat analysis with all available data, which is a pragmatic approach. However, the trial does not mention any exclusion of ineligible post-randomization participants or inclusion of only completers or those following the treatment protocol, making it more pragmatic than explanatory.

Score: [5]"," 1. Eligibility:
Quote: ""The pregnant women were randomly divided into three groups at a university hospital in the suburbs of Sao Paulo, Brazil, in order to receive either acupressure treatment, a placebo or participate as part of a control group.""

Reasoning: The trial includes pregnant women in labor with cervical dilations of ≥ 4 cm and with two or more contractions in 10 minutes, which is similar to the usual care setting. However, the trial excludes those with serious preeclampsia, placenta previa, immediate indication of cesarean, dilations at ≥ 8 cm, and those who used analgesics for less than six hours from the study admission time. These exclusion criteria make the trial more explanatory than pragmatic.
