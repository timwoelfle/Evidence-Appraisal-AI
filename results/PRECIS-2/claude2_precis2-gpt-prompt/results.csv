1528,[],"['5', '5', '5', '5', '2', '5', '5', '5', '5']","Here are the PRECIS-2 domain scores with supporting quotes and explanations:

Eligibility

Quotes:
""Participants were screened on the General Health Questionnaire 12 and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, and those with low mood were recruited.""
""Participants were included who scored >2 on the General Health Questionnaire 12, a measure of psychological distress, or >7 on the anxiety and depression subscales of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, thus confirming they had low mood.""

The eligibility criteria used screening tools commonly used in clinical practice to identify patients with low mood. No other exclusions are mentioned. This matches eligibility in usual care.
Score: [5] 

Recruitment

Quotes:
""Participants randomly allocated to the adjustment group received six group treatment sessions. The control group received usual care, which did not include psychological interventions.""

No extra recruitment efforts beyond random allocation are described. This matches recruitment in usual care.
Score: [5]

Setting

Quote: 
""The groups were delivered by two Band 5 assistant psychologists, who were supervised by a Band 8a clinical psychologist, experienced in working with people with multiple sclerosis.""

The intervention was delivered in a clinical setting with appropriately trained staff. This matches the usual care setting.
Score: [5] 

Organisation

Quote:
""The total running costs for the programme were £17,824. This was based on 54 three-hour sessions (including room hire and refreshments) and the salary of two NHS Band 5 assistant psychologists and one Band 8a clinical psychologist."" 

The staffing and costs described are within the normal NHS organization. No additional resources were provided.
Score: [5]

Flexibility (delivery)

Quotes: 
""Participants randomly allocated to the adjustment group received six group treatment sessions.""
""The groups involved teaching people to recognise symptoms of distress and introduced them to strategies to improve their mood.""

The intervention followed a standardized protocol over six sessions. This is less flexible than usual psychological care which is individualized.
Score: [2] 

Flexibility (adherence)

No discussion of measuring or enforcing adherence.
Score: [5] 

Follow-up

Quote:
""Four and eight months after random allocation, participants were sent a booklet of outcome questionnaires to complete and return by post.""

Follow-up matched what would occur in usual care.
Score: [5]

Primary outcome 

Quote: 
""Outcomes were assessed four and eight months after randomization, blind to group allocation. The costs were assessed from a service use questionnaire and information provided on medication. Quality of life was assessed using the EQ-5D.""

Outcomes included costs, EQ-5D quality of life, and mood scales. These are measures of direct importance to patients.
Score: [5]

Primary analysis

Quote:
""Owing to the level of missing EQ-5D data at follow-up, a ‘last value carried forward’ imputation approach was adopted.""

An intention-to-treat approach was used with imputation of missing data. This matches analysis in usual care.

Eligibility criteria:

Quote: ""The inclusion criteria were being definitely diagnosed with MS and having records in the Society and the exclusion criteria having history of other psychiatric disorders including major depressive disorder (according to the medical records and the physician's examinations) or bipolar disorder (except for cognitive disorders by which MS is characterized), substance dependency, any neurological disorders, history of taking corticosteroids or the disease recurrence within the previous six months.""

The eligibility criteria seem fairly broad - patients only needed a definite diagnosis of MS and to be registered with the society. The few exclusions are reasonable. Overall, the criteria seem similar to what would be used in usual care.

Score: [4] 

Recruitment:

Quote: ""To follow randomized assignment, we decided to run the sampling within two consecutive months until we enrolled an adequate number of participants. Accordingly, 70 numbers, equal to the number of people required in each group, were developed and the numbers 1–70 were randomly assigned to two groups: experimental and control. After eligible patients referred to the Association, a number was randomly assigned to each patient according to his/her referring time and the patients were assigned to the two groups.""

The recruitment process seems fairly typical - patients were recruited as they presented to the clinic over a set period of time. There is no mention of special efforts above usual care to recruit participants.

Flexibility (adherence):

Quote: No relevant quotes found.

The text does not describe measures to enforce or assess adherence.

Score: [NA] 

Follow-up:

Quote: ""To measure fatigue, the Piper Standard Scale was used. This scale consists of 27 items that measures fatigue in terms of four domains: behavioral, affective, tactile, and cognitive."" 

""Because the patients were not hospitalized and regularly referred to the Association, to follow randomized assignment, we decided to run the sampling within two consecutive months until we enrolled an adequate number of participants.""

Follow-up seems typical - patients were assessed during their regular clinic visits using standard scales over 2 months. There is no mention of extra visits or extensive additional data collection.

Score: [4]

Primary outcome: 

Quote: ""To investigate depression, anxiety, and stress, DASS-21, developed by Lovibond and Lovibond in 1995, was used and its validity and reliability were confirmed [17]. To measure fatigue, the Piper Standard Scale was used.""

Standard scales were used to assess depression, anxiety, stress and fatigue. These are clinically meaningful outcomes that would also be of interest in usual care.

1567,[],"['4', '4', '4', '4', '4', '4', '4', '5', '5']","Here are the PRECIS-2 domain assessments based on the provided full text:

# Eligibility

Quotes: 
1) ""Persons with MS (N = 183) with cognitive concerns were randomly assigned to either the 8-week MAPSS-MS intervention or usual care plus freely available computer games.""
2) ""The Perceived Deficits Questionnaire19 was administered by phone, and those scoring at least 10 (indicating some problems in at least 5 areas) were eligible to participate.""

This study recruited participants with MS who had subjective cognitive concerns, as measured by a screening questionnaire. The criteria appear to align with real-world eligibility for an intervention targeting cognitive impairment in MS patients.

Score: [4] 

# Recruitment

Quotes:
1) ""Participants were recruited via physician referral, targeted mailings to persons with MS on the mailing list of the National MS Society, contact with support groups, and notices in MS newsletters and web sites."" 
2) ""The 347 persons who were initially screened as “eligible” were later contacted by phone to invite their participation during specific dates.""

Participants were recruited through routine clinical and community channels like physician referral and MS support groups. This pragmatic approach mirrors how patients would find out about and be recruited to cognitive therapy in routine practice. 

Score: [4]

# Setting

Quote: ""Following approval by the Institutional Review Board for the University of Texas at Austin, participants were recruited from three large metropolitan communities in Texas: Houston, San Antonio and Dallas.""

The study was conducted at multiple sites in the community setting, not restricted to specialized trial or academic centers. This matches the setting where cognitive therapy would normally be delivered.

Score: [4]

# Organization 

Quote: ""The MAPSS-MS intervention aims to help persons with MS acquire the highest level of cognitive functioning and functional independence. The intervention includes group sessions (2 h per week for 8 weeks) focused on building efficacy for use of cognitive strategies and a home-based computer training program (45 min three times per week).""

The intervention was delivered through a feasible model involving limited group and individual sessions. It did not require substantially more resources or expertise than would be available in routine care.

Score: [4]

# Flexibility (delivery)

Quotes:
1) ""Based on the integration of Bandura’s self-efficacy theory20 with the investigators’ prior intervention studies,21,22 the program’s conceptual model proposes accurate knowledge of cognitive problems, lifestyle adjustments (sleep, stress management, physical activity) that support cognitive functioning, and self-efficacy to manage cognitive challenges will support persons with MS in the use of compensatory cognitive strategies and cognitive skills.""
2) ""The first four sessions focused on common cognitive problems experienced with MS (attention and processing speed, memory and language, visuospatial and executive functioning) and development of relevant compensatory strategies. The final four sessions focused on lifestyle behaviors to support cognitive functioning, including managing fatigue and stress and increasing physical activity."" 

The group sessions covered a range of cognitive issues, compensatory strategies, and lifestyle recommendations. The delivery allowed flexibility in tailoring the content to participants' individual needs and priorities.

Score: [4] 

# Flexibility (adherence)

Quote: ""Although individuals varied their computer training time from week to week, 68% met or exceeded the total time prescribed over the 8-week intervention. About half met or exceeded the goal each week.""

While participants were encouraged to complete a target number of computer training sessions, there was flexibility in how strictly participants needed to adhere to the full protocol. This level of flexibility mirrors what would occur in routine practice.

Score: [4]

# Follow-up

Quote: ""Neuropsychological testing and questionnaire data were collected from all subjects at baseline, following completion of the intervention, and 3 and 6 months post-intervention.""

The follow-up schedule involved only 3 post-intervention assessments over 6 months. It did not include more extensive follow-up than would occur in routine practice.

Score: [4]

# Primary outcome  

Quote: ""Persons with MS (N = 183) with cognitive concerns were randomly assigned to either the 8-week MAPSS-MS intervention or usual care plus freely available computer games. Participants completed self-report and performance measures of cognitive functioning, compensatory strategies and depression at baseline, immediately after the MAPSS-MS intervention, and three and six months post-intervention.""

The primary outcomes of self-reported cognitive functioning, use of compensatory strategies, and objective cognitive tests are highly relevant to the daily lives of participants.

Score: [5]

# Primary analysis

Quote: ""Changes in study outcomes were analyzed using intention to treat methodology, ANOVA with repeated measures, and ANCOVA.""

The use of intention-to-treat analysis mirrors how data would be analyzed in routine practice.

Eligibility:

Quote: ""Inclusion criteria were (1) 18–60  years of age, (2) ⩽2 years since clinical diagnosis with relapsing remitting MS (RRMS) and (3) no relapses or changes in medication status 8 weeks prior to inclusion.""

The eligibility criteria are quite broad, only excluding based on age, disease duration, and recent relapses/medication changes. Patients of any disability level were included as long as they had RRMS diagnosed within the past 2 years. This is fairly similar to patients who would receive exercise as part of usual care.

Score: [4]

Recruitment:

Quote: ""Patients (n = 84) were recruited in collaboration with six Danish regional MS clinics and The Danish MS Society.""

Patients were recruited through their regular clinic visits and an MS advocacy organization. No extra efforts like advertising or incentives were used. This matches usual care recruitment.

Score: [5] 

Setting: 

Quote: ""The exercise intervention included 3892 minutes of aerobic exercise at an average intensity of 76.2% HRmax. The exercise sessions consisted of continuous sessions lasting 30–60 minutes with an intensity of 60%–80% HRmax and interval training sessions lasting 30–60 minutes with an interval duration of 1–10 minutes and intensities varying from 65%–95% HRmax.""

The exercise intervention took place in a supervised setting, likely a research/clinical facility. This is more specialized than a typical exercise setting like a gym or community center used in usual care.

Score: [2]

Organization:

Quote: ""Patients received the exercise intervention in addition to usual care."" 

The exercise was delivered by study personnel, not the patients' usual healthcare providers. No details are provided on staff training or resources. The organization seems more structured than usual care exercise.

Score: [3] 

Flexibility (delivery): 

Quote: ""The exercise intervention was planned as high-intense aerobic exercise, monitored relative to the patients’ individual maximal heart rate (HRmax), and progressed within and between 4 meso cycles of 12 weeks.""

The exercise had a structured progression plan and heart rate monitoring. This is less flexible than usual care exercise without a set protocol.

Score: [2]

Flexibility (adherence):

No relevant quotes. The paper states the planned and achieved attendance but does not discuss encouragement or consequences for non-adherence. 

Score: [NA]

Follow-up:

Quote: ""All patients were scanned using the exact same 3-Tesla MRI scanner (MAGNETOM Skyra, Siemens Medical Systems, Erlangen, Germany) at the same location, for all patients, and at all timepoints.""

Patients had study-specific MRI scans at 3 set time points. This monitoring is much more extensive than typical patient follow-up.

Score: [1]

Primary outcome:

Quote: ""The annual relapse rate and the global brain atrophy rate were the primary outcomes of this study.""

Relapse rate is very clinically relevant. Brain atrophy is a surrogate marker not assessed in usual care.

Eligibility:

Quote: ""inclusion of PwMS with an unassisted but limited walking competency (100–500 m)"" 

This quote indicates that the eligibility criteria are quite broad, including patients with MS who have limited but unassisted walking ability. No exclusions are mentioned besides impaired cognition that interferes with consent. The criteria seem reasonably similar to patients who would receive this intervention in usual care.

Score: [4]

Recruitment:

Quote: ""Patients have been recruited at Ferrara University Hospital from patients who attend the Rehabilitation Outpatient Clinic for gait rehabilitation.""

The patients were recruited from a rehabilitation clinic where they were already receiving care. No special efforts like advertising or incentives were mentioned. Recruitment seems moderately pragmatic.

Score: [3] 

Setting:

Quote: ""TOCT includes six workstations with five levels of complexity (step, slalom, tandem exercise, goals, obstacles, long step). PwMS exercised for 5 min in each one (3 min of activities and 2 min of rest).""

The supervised training took place in a rehabilitation setting with specialized equipment like treadmills and workstations. This indicates a moderately explanatory setting.

Score: [3]

Organisation:

Quote: ""One session included up to three patients and lasted 120 min, five days/week for two weeks.""

The supervised training involved long sessions 5 days per week for 2 weeks. This intensive delivery required significant provider time and resources beyond usual care. 

Score: [2] 

Flexibility (delivery): 

Quote: ""During TOCT, they received feedback (visual and auditory) from the physiotherapist.""

The supervised training followed a strict protocol with close monitoring and feedback from providers. This suggests low flexibility in delivery.

Score: [2]

Flexibility (adherence):

No relevant quotes. The home program seems reasonably flexible regarding adherence.

Score: [4] 

Follow-up:

Quote: ""The blind evaluator, who did not supervise the training program, performed functional tests, questionnaires and instrumental measurements the week before treatment, the week after the end of the supervised-TOCT, after the 12-weeks home-based TOCT program.""

Follow-up assessment was more frequent than usual care, with multiple study visits for outcome measurement.

1769,[],"['3', 'NA', '4', '4', '3', '4', '3', '5', '5']","Here are the PRECIS-2 domain scores for the given clinical trial text:

Eligibility:
Quotes: 
""Patients with multiple sclerosis were randomly selected into treated and control groups; only patients who could walk with or without walking aids were admitted to the trial, and these cases were initially assessed and scored during an inactive phase of the disease.""
""In Manchester, patients who had relapsed in the previous eighteen months only were admitted to the trial.""
""Patients with diabetes mellitus or hypertension or who gave a history of psychiatric illness or peptic ulcer were not admitted to the treated group."" 

Reasoning: The eligibility criteria exclude patients with certain comorbidities and require patients to be ambulatory at baseline. The trial also limits enrollment to patients who have relapsed recently in one center. This suggests somewhat selective eligibility criteria compared to usual care.
Score: [3]

Recruitment:
Quote:
""This controlled study was started in 1963 in three cities-Belfast, Leeds, and Manchester.""

Reasoning: The text does not provide details on recruitment methods. Running the trial at multiple centers likely involved typical referral/recruitment from those centers. There is no evidence of special recruitment efforts.
Score: [NA] 

Setting:
Quote: 
""It could not be a double-blind study. A separate trial was carried out in the three centres using the same treatment and scoring methods.""

Reasoning: The trial was conducted at 3 centers in major cities, which does not seem very different from a regular clinical setting.
Score: [4]

Organization: 
Quote:
""The treated group were given corticotrophin (’ Acthar ’ gel) in a dosage which varied between 15 and 25 units daily, potassium chloride orally, and a low-salt diet.""

Reasoning: The intervention involves a drug, diet changes, and supplements. It does not appear that extra staffing or training was required to deliver the intervention beyond a typical clinic.
Score: [4]  

Flexibility (delivery):
Quotes:
""The dose of corticotrophin was adjusted to produce just enough "" mooning "" of the face to be appreciated by the physician in charge of the trial and the dose was not increased during a relapse.""
""Both treated and control groups were given aneurin 100 mg. by injection monthly.""

Reasoning: The corticotrophin dose was titrated and held constant during relapses, suggesting a protocolized administration schedule. Both groups received vitamin B12 injections, indicating some flexibility in allowed co-interventions. Overall, delivery of the intervention seems moderately flexible.
Score: [3]

Flexibility (adherence):
Quote: 
""When possible a glucose-tolerance test was carried out before corticotrophin was started.""

Reasoning: The text does not describe measures to enforce or assess adherence. A baseline glucose tolerance test was done when possible, but there is no evidence that participants were excluded based on adherence issues.
Score: [4]

Follow-up:
Quotes:
""All cases were seen at three-monthly intervals and scored on the Kurtzke (1961) scale; relapses lasting longer than twenty-four hours were also scored by a system in the three centres."" 
""The treated group were weighed, their urine was tested, blood-pressure recorded, and blood analysed for electrolytes.""

Reasoning: Follow-up occurred every 3 months, with clinical scoring and lab tests. This seems slightly more frequent than typical follow-up.
Score: [3]

Primary outcome: 
Quote: 
""Again there was no evidence to show that corticotrophin prevented deterioration or reduced the number or severity of the relapses; nor was there any evidence that corticotrophin adversely affected the disease process, apart from side-effects due to the drug itself.""

Reasoning: The primary outcomes of disability progression, relapse rate, and relapse severity are clinically meaningful to patients.
Score: [5]

Primary analysis:
Quote:
""The total results were obtained by adding the results from the three cities; this was considered justifiable since the methods of selection, treatment, and scoring were essentially the same."" 

Reasoning: All participants appear to be included in the analysis. There is no mention of excluding patients post-randomization.

The eligibility criteria are reasonably broad, including patients with mild to moderate MS who are ambulatory and stable. This is likely similar to eligibility for exercise programs in usual care. However, the upper age limit of 65 excludes older patients who may benefit.

Score: [3] 

Recruitment:

Quote 1: ""A total of 120 PwMS were recruited via the Sheffield MS Clinic and flyers/community adverts displayed at the local South Yorkshire MS Society branches.""

Quote 2: ""Many eligible PwMS declined to take part in the study without giving a reason (N = 126; 66%) and a more comprehensive understanding of the barriers and facilitators to exercise in PwMS could be used to inform the design of future programmes."" 

Recruitment was done through routine clinic visits and community adverts. No extraordinary efforts like newspaper ads or incentives were used. However, many patients declined to participate, suggesting recruitment was challenging.

Score: [3]

Setting: 

Quote: ""During weeks 1–6, participants attended two supervised sessions per week at a university exercise research facility and engaged in one additional self-directed exercise session in their home environment.""

The setting included both a specialized research facility as well as the patient's home environment. While not identical to usual care, it does incorporate community-based exercise.

Score: [3]

Organization:

Quote: ""The supervised exercise sessions incorporated cognitive-behavioural techniques (e.g. goal setting, finding social support, understanding the costs/benefits of exercise, etc.) to promote long-term participation in physical activity.""

The intervention provided additional training in behavioral techniques and likely had more staffing and resources compared to usual care.

Score: [2] 

Flexibility (delivery):

Quote: ""The home-exercise sessions were intended to mirror the supervised sessions in terms of intensity and duration of aerobic exercise, and also included tailored exercises for strength, flexibility and balance."" 

The home exercise portion allowed some flexibility but the supervised portion followed a structured protocol. Overall, there was some but not complete flexibility.

Score: [3]

Flexibility (adherence): 

Quote: ""Using the Transtheoretical Model as a guiding framework, this aspect of the intervention was aimed at equipping PwMS with the skills, knowledge and confidence to engage in a more physically active lifestyle.""

The intervention incorporated strategies to encourage adherence but did not measure or mandate adherence. Flexibility was likely close to usual care.

Score: [4] 

Follow-up:

Quote: ""Outcomes were blindly assessed by an experienced researcher not directly involved with the day-to-day running of the trial.""

Follow-up assessments were performed by blinded outcome assessors at discrete time points. This is more intensive than usual care.

Score: [2]

Primary outcome:

Quote: ""The primary outcome was self-reported exercise behaviour at three months using the Godin Leisure Time Exercise Questionnaire (GLTEQ).""

The primary outcome of self-reported exercise is highly patient-centered and pragmatic.

Score: [5] 

Primary analysis:

Quote: ""All analyses were by intention to treat, whereby participants were analysed in the arm to which they were randomised irrespective of whether they complied with the intervention.""

The primary analysis was a pragmatic intention-to-treat approach.

Recruitment

Relevant quotes:  
- ""At Sheffield potential participants were identified from clinic attenders, MS nurse patient visits and from patients with MS from the caseload of the neuropsychologist. At the Walton Centre potential participants were identified solely from the MS register.""

Participants were recruited through routine clinic visits and an MS registry, reflecting usual methods to engage patients in care. No extraordinary recruitment efforts like advertising or incentives were used.

Score: [4]


Setting

Relevant quotes:
- ""The study was conducted at two UK centres - Sheffield Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust and The Walton Centre NHS Foundation Trust, Liverpool.""

The settings were routine NHS hospital clinics rather than specialized trial or academic centers. This matches the setting where patients would receive CCBT in usual care.

Score: [4]


Organisation

Relevant quote: 
- ""The CCBT service provided to trial participants was the routine service provided to all patients referred to the PCT mental health care teams.""

The CCBT intervention arm received the same organizational resources and delivery model as in usual NHS care. No additional staffing, training, etc. was provided.

Score: [4]


Flexibility (delivery)

Relevant quotes:
- ""Only one out of the five participating PCTs around the Sheffield centre formally provided any kind of community facility for accessing CCBT; PCT staff warned that clients rarely used the facility and it was closed during the course of the study."" 
- ""No PCT with whom we worked offered advice or support for defining problems on which to work or applying the CBT model to individual problems.""

The CCBT was delivered according to routine procedures, without extra support or flexibility. This matches usual care.

- ""Key exclusion criteria were being within 3 months of ceasing a multiple sclerosis disease-modifying drug, receiving steroid treatment within the preceding month, or participating in another clinical trial.""

The inclusion criteria focused on adults with progressive MS and significant mobility impairment based on EDSS scores. The exclusions were minimal, related to recent medication changes. Overall, the criteria reflect a typical MS population that would receive this intervention in usual care.

Score: [4] 

### Recruitment  
Relevant quotes:
- ""Participants were recruited through eight health-care organisations, including the UK National Health Service (NHS) Trusts, social enterprises, and third sector multiple sclerosis therapy centres, in two regions (Devon–Cornwall and East Anglia) of the UK.""
- ""Individuals were invited consecutively until the allocated number of standing frames (dependent on commissioning costs) at each health-care organisation had been reached.""

Participants were recruited through routine health care organizations, rather than through advertisements or other special recruitment efforts. This pragmatic approach mirrors how patients would access this intervention in real-world practice.

Score: [5]

### Setting
Relevant quotes: 
- ""The intervention consisted of two home-based physiotherapy sessions (60 min each) to set up the standing frame programme, supported by six follow-up telephone calls (15 min per call).""
- ""Participants were asked to stand for 30 min, three times per week over 20 weeks, and encouraged to continue in the longer term, although no further physiotherapy support was provided."" 

The intervention was delivered entirely within participants' own homes, the same setting where it would be implemented in usual care. 

Score: [5] 

### Organization
Relevant quote:
- ""The use of standing frames is a recognised core skill for UK-trained neurological physiotherapists. To standardise and optimise implementation of the intervention, we provided educational materials and assessed fidelity to them.16 All participants received their usual health and social service input throughout the study period.16 This input was recorded on a self-report health-care and social-care resource form, which included changes in medication.""

The physiotherapists delivering the intervention were those already working in the participating NHS organizations, without additional training or resources provided. This matches how the intervention would be organized and delivered in real-world practice.

Score: [5]

### Flexibility (delivery)
Relevant quotes:
- ""In line with previous research,14 participants were asked to stand in the frame for 30 min three times per week over 20 weeks, and to record the frequency and duration of each stand in a daily diary."" 
- ""This allowed for a graduated introduction to standing.""

The protocol specified a recommended standing duration and frequency, but allowed flexibility in how participants gradually increased their standing time over 20 weeks. This pragmatic approach provides guidance while accommodating individual needs and abilities.

Score: [4] 

### Flexibility (adherence)  
Relevant quote: 
- ""At the end of the 20-week period, participants were encouraged to continue to regularly stand, although no further physiotherapy support was provided.""

After the initial 20-week intervention period, participants were encouraged but not required to continue standing regularly. This mirrors how adherence would be managed in usual care.

Score: [5]

### Follow-up  
Relevant quotes:
- ""The SUMS study was an individually randomised, controlled, pragmatic, multi-centre, superiority trial with masked outcome assessments in people with progressive multiple sclerosis. Participants were randomly assigned to receive either usual care or usual care plus a standing programme, with masked assessments done at baseline, 20 weeks post-randomisation (aligned with the end of the protocol intervention period for those allocated to the intervention group), and again 16 weeks afterwards (36 weeks post-randomisation).""
- ""We achieved this by using daily, self-reported, preformatted diaries.""

Follow-up assessments were limited to 3 major time points over 36 weeks, consistent with monitoring in usual practice. Adverse event monitoring used self-report diaries, avoiding extensive clinic visits. This pragmatic approach minimizes study-specific data collection.

Score: [4] 

### Primary outcome
Relevant quote:  
- ""The primary outcome was motor function as measured by the Amended Motor Club Assessment (AMCA) score23 at the primary endpoint of 36 weeks post-randomisation. This score was developed for use by physiotherapists in a clinical setting to assess motor function in people with multiple sclerosis and has shown validity, reliability, and responsiveness.""

The AMCA scale measures functional mobility and motor impairment, outcomes that are clinically meaningful to patients. It was specifically developed for assessing MS patients in clinical settings.

- ""Inclusion criteria were patients in South East London, living with MS and deemed (by clinicians) to have one or more of unresolved symptoms, psychosocial concerns, end-of-life issues, progressive illness, or complex needs (i.e., palliative care needs).""

The eligibility criteria seem fairly broad, as patients only needed to be referred by clinicians and have some palliative care needs. The trial was limited to a specific geographic region, but within that region the criteria reflect usual care.

Score: [4] 

2. Recruitment

Quotes: 
- ""Referrals were screened by a consultant in palliative medicine who was independent from delivering the service (P. M. E./I. J. H).""
- ""Educational seminars informed local health and social care professionals about the PCT.""

Patients were referred through their usual clinicians rather than through targeted recruitment efforts. This reflects how patients would access palliative care in real-world settings.

Score: [5]

3. Setting

Quote: 
- ""Patients were visited in their own homes or sometimes outpatient clinics, nursing homes, or hospital.""

The interventions were delivered in the patients' usual care settings rather than in specialized trial centers. This matches real-world care.

Score: [5] 

4. Organization

Quote: 
- ""In addition to continuing to receive usual services (see below), patients in the fast-track group received care from a PCT. This comprised one part-time consultant in palliative medicine, one part-time clinical nurse specialist, one administrator, and one psychosocial worker, and was based in a large teaching hospital.""

The palliative care team appears to have staffing and resources consistent with real-world palliative care teams.

Score: [4]

5. Flexibility (delivery)

Quote:  
- ""Care was provided in a similar way to palliative care consultation services described elsewhere,9, 11 although the PCT worked in both hospital and the community, and so could visit patients wherever they were. Patients had one to three contacts (visits and/or phone calls) from the PCT...""

The palliative care was delivered flexibly, tailored to each patient's needs, which matches real-world care.

6. Flexibility (adherence)

No relevant quotes. The text does not discuss any measures to enforce or monitor adherence.

Score: [NA] 

7. Follow-up

Quote:
- ""We conducted face-to-face interviews with patients and gave self-complete questionnaires to caregivers. At baseline, we collected demographic and clinical data, and the patient's functional status...""

Follow-up data collection seems quite extensive, going beyond what would occur in usual care. This includes multiple interviews, questionnaires, and functional assessments.

Score: [2]

8. Primary outcome

Quote: 
- ""Our standardized questionnaires included the Palliative Care Outcome Scale (POS-8), comprising eight questions on anxiety, patient and carer concerns, and practical needs, each rated 0–4; a single-item POS pain score (rated 0 [best] to 4 [worst]); and caregivers' burden (using the 12-item version of the Zarit Carer Burden Inventory [ZBI]).""

The primary outcomes of pain, anxiety, caregiver burden are clinically important to patients. However, they rely on specialized scales rather than simple outcomes like survival.

Score: [3]

Quote: ""Eligibility criteria for patients: diagnosis RRMS since at least one year, EDSS score ≤4.0, no symptoms suggestive of a relapse, no relapse in the preceding four weeks, willing and capable of participating in the investigations, and having access to the internet for performing the web-based assessments.""

The eligibility criteria are moderately pragmatic. Patients had to have a diagnosis of RRMS for at least 1 year and mild disability per the EDSS score. While the RRMS diagnosis matches usual care, restricting to only patients with low disability levels makes the trial less pragmatic. The other criteria around relapse status, willingness/capability to participate, and internet access are reasonable.

Score: [3] 

Recruitment:

Quote: ""Participants were recruited from all over the Netherlands by the patient organisation NMSF, Rotterdam, the Netherlands. Interested patients were contacted by a registered nurse experienced in MS (MH) by phone to check diagnosis and eligibility criteria.""

The recruitment through the patient organization NMSF and initial screening by phone are moderately pragmatic approaches that go somewhat beyond referral at usual care appointments but are not as intensive as mailings or advertising.

Score: [3]

Setting: 

Quote: ""CDTs were given during three consecutive days in Zorghotel Spelderholt, Beekbergen, the Netherlands, a facility especially equipped for the accommodation of people with impaired health.""

The setting at the Zorghotel is more intensive than usual care, though reasonable for delivering this multiday intervention. It's not as highly specialized as an academic hospital.

Eligibility:

Relevant quotes: 
""The only selection criterion was that the diagnosis of MS was confirmed by the general practitioner. There were no exclusion criteria.""

Reasoning: The trial had very broad eligibility criteria, simply requiring a confirmed diagnosis of MS with no other exclusions. This is very similar to eligibility in usual care.

Score: [5]


Recruitment:

Relevant quotes:  
""Participants were volunteers with MS who were recruited through voluntary organizations, were community based and lived in West London and in counties contiguous with Greater London.""

Reasoning: Participants were recruited through voluntary organizations rather than clinics or targeted advertising/incentives. This pragmatic recruitment is fairly similar to engagement in usual care.

Score: [4]


Setting: 

Relevant quotes:
""The study was conducted with people with MS living in the community.""
""Sessions were conducted either at participants’ homes or in local therapy centres.""

Reasoning: The setting was the community and participants' homes, very similar to usual care and not specialized trial centers. 

Score: [5]


Organisation:

Relevant quote: 
""The self-care programme primarily comprised a discussion of self-care strategies supported by an information booklet developed for the study in line with consumer priorities.""

Reasoning: The intervention used existing community resources and did not require extensive additional training or expertise beyond usual care.

Score: [4]


Flexibility (delivery):

Relevant quotes:  
""The discussions lasted between 1 and 2 hours and were conducted on two occasions, over a one month period.""
""As findings from the Delphi study highlighted the need for flexibility and responsiveness to individuals the format of the discussion focused on individuals’ interests and concerns rather than on covering all the information contained in the booklet.""

Reasoning: The delivery allowed some flexibility in format and topics based on individual priorities, similar to usual care. It was not a rigid protocol.

Score: [4]


Flexibility (adherence): 

Relevant quote:
""Participants were invited to join the study and were accepted when informed consent had been given in writing."" 

Reasoning: After consenting, there was no monitoring or enforcement of adherence. This is very similar to usual care.

Explanation: The eligibility criteria are fairly broad, aiming to recruit typical MS patients with foot drop lasting over 3 months. However, some exclusions are applied, such as excluding those who previously used AFOs or FES, those with cognitive impairment, and those with other gait issues besides foot drop. Overall, the criteria attempt to target MS patients who would be candidates for these interventions in regular practice.

Score: [4] 

### Recruitment

Quotes:
- ""Potential participants known to Multiple Sclerosis healthcare practitioners working across seven outpatient centres in Scotland – Ayrshire & Arran, Greater Glasgow & Clyde, Dumfries and Galloway, Lanarkshire, Lothian, Fife and Tayside – were informed of the study and issued with a participant information sheet."" 
- ""Potential participants contacted the researchers if they were interested in participating.""

Explanation: Participants were recruited through typical clinical settings where MS patients receive care. Healthcare providers informed eligible patients about the study, rather than using advertisements or incentives. Patients then self-referred if interested. This recruitment process mirrors how patients would likely be identified and engaged in real world practice.

Ethical approval was granted by the West of Scotland Research Ethics Committee (14/WS/0014) and the study was sponsored by NHS Ayrshire and Arran Research and Development department.""
- ""A multicentre design of this study enhances the generalizability of results. However, although the ankle-foot orthoses prescription was standardized, variations did occur across sites.""

Explanation: The study took place across 7 NHS hospital sites, reflecting real-world care settings for MS patients in Scotland. It had NHS research ethics approval, indicating it followed NHS research governance. The multicenter design in routine care settings enhances generalizability. 

Score: [5] 

### Organization

Quote: 
- ""Participants randomized to the usual care group were fitted with a custom-made, solid, ankle-foot orthosis by an orthotist, within four weeks of their initial assessment. The recommendations made by the Best Practice Statement for ankle-foot orthoses following stroke were applied.""

Explanation: The AFO devices and fitting process reflect typical real-world standards of care by NHS orthotists. No additional resources or expertise beyond routine care were provided.

Score: [5]


### Flexibility (delivery)

Quotes:

- ""Participants randomized to the functional electrical stimulation group were assessed and fitted with an Odstock Dropped Foot Stimulator Pace (OML, Salisbury) device by a physiotherapist experienced in functional electrical stimulation (A.L.). Wired heel switches and a stimulation frequency of 40 Hz were applied. Electrode position, pulse width, waveform and ramping parameters were adjusted for each participant in order to achieve a comfortable and efficient muscle contraction. The current amplitude ranged from 7 to 72 mA (mean = 40 mA).""

Explanation: The AFO and FES interventions were delivered according to standardized protocols and optimized for each patient, but with some flexibility allowed in fine-tuning the devices. This mirrors flexible delivery in routine practice.

Score: [4] 

### Flexibility (adherence)

Quote:  
- ""Participants in both groups were instructed to gradually increase the wear of their devices over the first six weeks.""

Explanation: Patients were instructed to increase wear time gradually over 6 weeks, but no specific adherence requirements were enforced. This provides flexibility similar to real world adherence.

Score: [5]

### Follow-up

Quotes:
- ""Outcome measures were administered by two unblinded assessors (Rebecca Hunter and A.L.) at baseline (0), 3, 6 and 12 months, except for the Psychological Impact of Assistive Devices Score15 which was administered at 12 months only.""
- ""For the Timed 25 Foot Walk, participants walked along a 25 foot course ‘as quickly as possible, but safely’. The test was repeated four times, twice with and twice without the device.""

Explanation: Follow-up frequency and outcome assessments were more intensive than would occur in routine practice. Patients had study visits at 0, 3, 6, and 12 months with multiple outcome measures evaluated at each visit. This exceeds typical clinical follow-up.

Score: [2]

### Primary Outcome

Quotes: 
- ""The primary outcome was walking speed as measured by the 5-minute self-selected walk test. Participants walked twice, once with their device and once without, resting for 20 minutes between. The order of testing was randomized between participants but was kept consistent for each participant throughout the trial. Participants walked at their preferred walking speed around a 9.5 m elliptical course for 5 minutes, resulting in a 10-meter shuttle length. The total distance walked was recorded and the mean walking speed (m/s) calculated.""

Explanation: The primary outcome of self-selected walking speed is clinically meaningful and patient-centered. It assesses effectiveness on an outcome directly impacting patients' daily lives.

Score: [5]

### Primary Analysis

""Eligible participants were excluded from the study if they were already engaged in a formal exercise program lasting >30 minutes twice per week, experienced an exacerbation within the past 4 weeks, had their MS immunomodulation medications altered in the previous 4 weeks or during the trial period, or declined to be randomly allocated.""

The eligibility criteria are fairly broad, including people with MS who can walk 10 meters in 2 minutes with or without an aid. However, some people are excluded such as those already engaged in regular exercise programs and those with recent medication changes or relapses. Overall, the criteria seem moderately pragmatic.

Score: [3] 

## Recruitment

Quote: 
""Community dwelling people with MS were recruited through the Multiple Sclerosis Society of New South Wales and South Australia.""

The participants were recruited from the community through a MS society rather than referred from clinics or targeted advertising. This pragmatic approach mirrors how people would access interventions in routine practice.

Score: [4]

## Setting
Quote:
""The group program was conducted at a local community center and included four to six participants per class."" 

The group intervention took place in a community center, a real world setting. This is more pragmatic than a specialized hospital or research setting.

Score: [4] 

## Organization
Quote: 
""Groups were led by a physiotherapist employed by the Multiple Sclerosis Society who received training to ensure a standard approach to intervention, intensity, and progression.""

The group intervention was delivered by physiotherapists who work for the MS Society rather than specialized research staff. However, they did receive additional training for standardization. This is moderately pragmatic.

Score: [3]

## Flexibility (delivery)
Quotes:
""Guidelines were provided to physiotherapists and participants for exercises to be adapted and progressed to suit individual functional ability via increasing repetitions, amplitude of movement, speed of movement, and modifying base of support.""

""Exercises were aimed at improving gait speed, endurance, and balance. They were individualized, specific, progressed in load, and performed at a moderate to high intensity.""

The exercise program allowed for some flexibility and individualization in delivery while still following guidelines. This balances flexibility with standardization. 

Score: [3] 

## Flexibility (adherence)
Quote: 
""In both group and home exercise sessions, participants completed eight, 6 minute exercises/stations per session plus a 5-minute warm up and cool down as outlined in the Appendix S1."" 

The intervention involved a structured program with set stations and duration. There was no mention of assessing or encouraging adherence. This protocol-driven approach is more explanatory.

Score: [2]

## Follow-up
Quotes:
""Outcome assessments were conducted at baseline, immediately postintervention and at 8-week follow-up.""

""Adherence (proportion of exercise sessions completed) was recorded in both groups."" 

Follow-up assessments were limited to two post-intervention time points and adherence was monitored closely. This is more explanatory.

Exclusions were: unstabilised concomitant disease, awaiting surgery and already receiving care from the practitioners involved in the study.""

The eligibility criteria are fairly broad, including adults with a diagnosis of RA who can complete questionnaires. The few exclusions are reasonable. This suggests the participants are likely similar to patients who would receive the intervention in usual care.

Score: [4]

Recruitment:
""After gaining patient consent, demographics and disease activity score in 28 joints (DAS28), patients were randomly assigned using a remote secure telephone randomisation service provided by Leeds University Clinical Trials Research Unit.""

""When patients arrived at the clinic, the independent assessor performed ‘joint counts’ for DAS28 and then oversaw the completion of self-reported pain visual analogue scale (pain-VAS), fatigue-VAS and duration of morning stiffness.""

Patients were recruited during their normal clinic visits. No special efforts were made to recruit participants beyond the clinic setting.

Score: [4] 

Setting:
""This study was conducted in outpatient clinics of 10 rheumatology centres across the UK.""

The study took place in regular rheumatology clinic settings, suggesting a pragmatic approach.

Score: [5]

Organization: 
No information is provided about staffing, resources, or care delivery being substantially different from usual care.

Score: [4]

Flexibility (delivery):
""The NLC interventions usually include allocated 30-min time slots in which the CNS takes history, performs physical examination, pain control, prescribing or recommending medication and dosage changes, intra-articular or intramuscular steroid injections, provision of patient education, psychosocial support and ordering blood tests or X-rays. Referrals for ward admission, to the rheumatologist or other health professionals, were carried out as appropriate."" 

""The usual RLC is similar to the above except that it usually involves an allocated 15-min time slot.""

The nurse-led and rheumatologist-led interventions were delivered per protocol with allocated time slots. This suggests some flexibility in how the intervention was delivered, but protocolized care.

Score: [3] 

Flexibility (adherence): 
No information is provided about how patient adherence was addressed.

Score: [NA]

Follow-up:
""Patients were seen by their respective practitioners at baseline and at weeks 13, 26, 39 and 52.""

Follow-up was more frequent than usual care to allow comparison between groups.

Score: [2]

Primary outcome:
""The primary outcome was disease activity score in 28 joints (DAS28) and secondary outcomes were pain severity (pain-VAS), fatigue (fatigue-VAS) and duration of morning stiffness measured at each study visit.""

The primary outcome of DAS28 is a disease-specific measure that is clinically meaningful. 

Score: [4]

Primary analysis:
""Analysis followed per-protocol (PP) and intention-to-treat (ITT) approaches.""

The study used both PP and ITT analysis, suggesting a pragmatic approach.

722,[],"['4', '5', '5', '5', '5', '5', '4', '5', '5']","Here are the PRECIS-2 domain scores for the trial based on the provided text:

Eligibility:

Quote: ""Men and women aged ≥18 years at high CVD risk, defined as either established CVD (history of coronary, ischaemic cerebrovascular, or peripheral vascular disease) or an estimated five-year CVD risk of ≥15% (using the Framingham risk equation, including a 5% increment for Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander identification)21 were eligible. Each participant had to have, in their doctor’s view, indications for all and no contraindications to any component of at least one of two polypills – version 1 (containing aspirin 75 mg, simvastatin 40 mg, lisinopril 10 mg, atenolol 50 mg) or version 2 (containing aspirin 75 mg, simvastatin 40 mg, lisinopril 10 mg, hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg).""

The eligibility criteria are relatively broad, including adults at high CVD risk. The criteria align with guidelines for prescribing the medications in the polypill. Some patients were excluded if the doctor felt it was inappropriate to change medications, but overall the eligibility seems pragmatic.

Score: [4] 

Recruitment:

Quote: ""All participants were treated by their regular doctor following randomization."" 

Participants were recruited through their regular doctors at primary care clinics. No extra efforts were made to recruit participants.

Score: [5]

Setting: 

Quote: ""All patient care was provided through existing primary healthcare practices, with rural and remote communities included to ensure that ‘real-life’ variations in healthcare delivery were captured.""

The study was conducted in real-world primary care settings. This matches the setting where the intervention would be implemented in practice.

Score: [5]

Organization:

Quote: ""Prescription and dispensing of the polypill occurred in the same way as for other medications. This mostly involved doctors providing patients with written prescriptions, and patients presenting the prescriptions to designated local pharmacies where all drugs (including the polypill) were dispensed.""

The polypill was prescribed, dispensed, and paid for in the same way as usual medications. No extra resources or provider training was provided. This matches real-world care.

Score: [5] 

Flexibility (delivery):

Quote: ""Those allocated to the polypill-based strategy were prescribed one of the polypill versions at the discretion of their doctor, to be taken at a time suggested by the doctor. No attempt was made to influence any other aspect of their management. The doctor could, at any time, change prescription to the alternative polypill version, add drugs on top of the polypill, or withdraw the polypill and substitute individual drugs of their choice.""

Doctors had flexibility in prescribing the polypill or individual medications. There was no strict protocol or monitoring of compliance. This matches real-world flexibility.

Score: [5]

Flexibility (adherence): 

Quote: ""Those allocated to the polypill-based strategy were prescribed one of the polypill versions at the discretion of their doctor, to be taken at a time suggested by the doctor.""

No special measures were taken to improve adherence. Patients likely received usual encouragement to take medications as prescribed.

Score: [5] 

Follow-up:

Quote: ""Participants attended the primary healthcare centres for trial assessments at randomization and 12 month intervals thereafter. All participants were also reviewed one month post-randomization and at intervening six month intervals, but these could be conducted by telephone.""

Follow-up schedule was reasonable and similar to what would occur in routine practice. Assessments were done at the regular primary care clinics.

Score: [4]

Primary outcome:

Quote: ""Primary outcomes were self-reported use of indicated combination treatment (antiplatelet, statin and ≥2 blood pressure lowering therapies for ≥4 of the previous seven days) at study end; and changes in systolic BP and total cholesterol from baseline to study end.""

The primary outcomes of medication adherence, blood pressure, and cholesterol are clinically important to patients.

Score: [5] 

Primary analysis:

Quote: ""All analyses were conducted on an intention-to-treat basis without imputation of missing data.""

An intention-to-treat analysis was used including all randomized participants. This matches real-world analysis.

Score: [5]

725,[],"['3', '5', '5', '5', '5', '5', '5', '5', '5']","Here are the PRECIS-2 domain scores with reasoning:

ELIGIBILITY:

Relevant quotes:
""Patients were eligible for inclusion if they were aged 16 years or older and presented within 3 weeks after sustaining a displaced fracture of the proximal humerus that involved the surgical neck.""

""Excluded patients had associated dislocation of the injured shoulder joint, open fracture, insufficient mental capacity to understand the trial or instructions for rehabilitation, comorbidities precluding surgery or anesthesia, clear indication for surgery such as severe soft-tissue compromise, multiple injuries (upper limb fractures), pathological fracture (other than osteoporotic), terminal illness, or were not a resident in the hospital catchment area.""

The eligibility criteria are reasonably broad, including adults over 16 with displaced proximal humerus fractures involving the surgical neck. However, some patients are excluded due to comorbidities, insufficient mental capacity, and terminal illness. These exclusions likely make the study population slightly healthier than patients seen in usual care.

Score: [3] 

RECRUITMENT:

Relevant quotes: 
""Patients received their allocated treatment from the recruiting hospital."" 

""Reflecting known differences in osteoporosis-related fracture risk among different races, trial participants were asked to identify whether they were white, black, Asian, or other.""

Patients were recruited during routine clinical care at the orthopedic departments of the hospitals. No special efforts were made to enhance recruitment beyond approaching eligible patients at their usual appointments. The study population demographics match what would be expected based on epidemiology.

Score: [5]  

SETTING: 

Relevant quotes:
""There was 1 additional National Health Service hospital that screened but failed to recruit patients into the PROFHER trial. All 33 hospitals routinely provide surgical and nonsurgical fracture treatment.""

""Physiotherapy treatment log data demonstrated equal access and implementation between groups, with similarly high numbers of participants recorded as performing home exercises (109 in surgical group vs 103 in nonsurgical group) in both groups.""

The study was conducted at routine NHS hospitals providing standard surgical and nonsurgical treatment. Rehabilitation was provided through routine NHS services. The setting matches real-world clinical practice.

Score: [5]

ORGANIZATION:

Relevant quotes: 
""It was emphasized that good standards of care, both surgical and nonsurgical, should be provided throughout the treatment pathway for the injury, including surgical care or management of the sling, postoperative care, and rehabilitation in both groups.""

""Consistent with the study protocol, 29 of 32 recruiting centers (91%) recommended 3 or more weeks of sling use."" 

The study used typical NHS resources, staffing, and clinical pathways. Good standard of care was emphasized. No additional resources or training were provided beyond routine practice.

Score: [5]  

FLEXIBILITY (delivery):

Relevant quote:
""To avoid learning curve problems, surgeons and physiotherapists used surgical interventions and procedures with which they were familiar.""

The surgeons used techniques they were experienced with, avoiding experimental procedures. No strict treatment protocols were enforced beyond normal clinical practice. Flexibility appears very similar to usual care.

Score: [5]

FLEXIBILITY (adherence):

Relevant quote: 
""Consistent with the study protocol, 29 of 32 recruiting centers (91%) recommended 3 or more weeks of sling use.""

After randomization, there seem to be no extraordinary measures to enforce adherence beyond giving the recommendation for sling use. Patients likely had flexibility similar to usual care.

Score: [5] 

FOLLOW-UP:

Relevant quote:
""Follow-up was up to 2 years (until April 2013) for all patients.""

""There was no trial-related clinical assessment or radiological follow-up of patients."" 

Follow-up was limited to patient questionnaires sent by mail at fixed times up to 2 years. No extra visits or exams were done. Follow-up intensity matches usual care.

Score: [5]

PRIMARY OUTCOME:

Relevant quote: 
""The primary outcome was the Oxford Shoulder Score (OSS), which is a shoulder-specific outcome measure validated in a UK population. The OSS provides a total score based on the patient’s subjective assessment of pain and function.""

The primary outcome is a patient-reported functional scale, which is highly relevant to patients. No surrogate outcomes are used.

Score: [5] 

PRIMARY ANALYSIS:

Relevant quote:
""All analyses were on an intention-to-treat basis and included all randomized patients in the groups to which they were randomized.""

The primary analysis was intent-to-treat including all randomized patients. This matches real-world practice.

733,[],"['4', '4', '5', '3', '3', '2', '4', '5', '5']","Here are the PRECIS-2 domain scores with quotes and explanations:

Eligibility:

Quote: ""Patients were eligible to participate if they were: community dwelling aged ≥65 years; independently mobile (with or without a walking aid); and physically able to take part in group exercise. Patients were excluded if they: had experienced ≥3 falls in the previous year; had unstable clinical conditions; would be unable to follow instructions about exercise safely; or were receiving palliative care.""

Explanation: The eligibility criteria are fairly broad, including community-dwelling adults aged 65+ who are mobile and can participate in group exercise. The exclusions are limited to those at high fall risk, with unstable conditions, inability to follow instructions safely, or in palliative care. This reflects eligibility in usual practice quite closely. Score: [4] 

Recruitment:

Quote: ""Practices were recruited with assistance from Primary Care Research Networks for London, Derby, and Nottingham. Patients aged ≥65 years were identified by searches of computerised medical records and invited to participate by letter from their GP.""

Explanation: Participants were recruited through their regular general practices by inviting all eligible patients via letter. This is similar to recruitment in usual practice. Score: [4]

Setting: 

Quote: ""The FaME intervention took place in a group once a week and included exercises to be carried out at home, unsupervised, twice weekly. The OEP was undertaken at home, unsupervised, and comprised exercises to be done three times per week.""

Explanation: The settings were community venues and participants' homes, which are routine settings for delivery of exercise programs in usual care. Score: [5]

Organization:

Quote: ""Weekly FaME classes were run in local venues by postural stability instructors trained to work with older people. Both interventions were delivered for 24 weeks."" 

Explanation: The trial used postural stability instructors to deliver the interventions, which represents greater resources and specialized providers compared to usual care. Score: [3] 

Flexibility (delivery):

Quote: ""The programmes included the following progression: OEP — ankle weights and hand holds; and FaME — resistance bands and hand holds, plus a move to more dynamic balance work and floor work with postural stability instructors.""

Explanation: The exercise programs were standardized protocols tailored to individuals' capabilities. This allows less flexibility than usual care. Score: [3]

Flexibility (adherence): 

Quote: ""Adherence was defined as (minutes spent exercising/intended minutes) 100%, where patients with values exceeding 75% were regarded as ‘adherent’.""

Explanation: Participants were categorized as adherent if they completed >75% of intended exercise time. This represents fairly high adherence expectations. Score: [2]

Follow-up:

Quote: ""Participants were followed up every 6 months after the end of the intervention period, until 24 months. The primary time point was chosen as 12 months post-intervention to match other trials.""

Explanation: Follow-up was limited to questionnaires every 6 months post-intervention. This is less intensive than a usual care exercise program. Score: [4]

Primary outcome:

Quote: ""The primary outcome was the proportion of participants who reported reaching ≥150 minutes of MVPA per week. Physical activity was assessed using three validated questionnaires."" 

Explanation: The primary outcome is achieving physical activity guidelines, which is a patient-centered and clinically relevant outcome, assessed through questionnaires as in usual practice. Score: [5]

Primary analysis:

Quote: ""Participants were analysed in the groups to which they were randomised, regardless of whether they received the intervention or not, and multiple imputation was used to include all participants in the analyses.""

Explanation: Analysis was by intention-to-treat. Score: [5]
