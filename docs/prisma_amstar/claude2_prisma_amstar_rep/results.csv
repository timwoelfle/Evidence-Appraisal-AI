A1. Was an 'a priori' design provided? 
""[Yes] The research question and inclusion criteria should be established before the conduct of the review. Note: Need to refer to a protocol, ethics approval, or pre-determined/a priori published research objectives to score a “yes.”""
Quotes: ""Our objective was to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of all published literature comparing the postoperative outcomes associated with elective surgery (while asymptomatic) versus those following surgery as part of expectant management (i.e., performing surgery only upon the development of symptoms) in children born with asymptomatic CPAM lesions.""
Reasoning: The objective and inclusion criteria were pre-specified.

A2. Was there duplicate study selection and data extraction?
""[Yes] There should be at least two independent data extractors and a consensus procedure for disagreements should be in place. Note: 2 people do study selection, 2 people do data extraction, consensus process or one person checks the other’s work.""
Quotes: ""Two independent reviewers conducted all article screening; where consensus on an article could not be reached, a third reviewer was consulted."" ""One reviewer extracted all data from the included studies, and another checked it for accuracy and completeness.""  
Reasoning: Two reviewers independently selected studies and extracted data.

A3. Was a comprehensive literature search performed?
""[Yes] At least two electronic sources should be searched. The report must include years and databases used (e.g., Central, EMBASE, and MEDLINE). Key words and/or MESH terms must be stated and where feasible the search strategy should be provided. All searches should be supplemented by consulting current contents, reviews, textbooks, specialized registers, or experts in the particular field of study, and by reviewing the references in the studies found. Note: If at least 2 sources + one supplementary strategy used, select “yes” (Cochrane register/Central counts as 2 sources; a grey literature search counts as supplementary).""
Quotes: ""We conducted an electronic literature search of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (1966 onwards), EMBASE (1980 onwards), CINAHL (1982 onwards), and PubMed (1966 onwards) in January 2015."" ""We used the search terms (“asymptomatic” AND “congenital” AND “cystic” AND “adenomatoid malformation”) OR (“lung” AND “lesion”) AND (“management” OR “treatment” OR “therapy.”)."" ""Finally, we hand-searched the reference sections of all relevant articles to identify additional studies.""
Reasoning: Searched multiple databases, reported search terms, and hand-searched references.

A4. Was the status of publication (i.e. grey literature) used as an inclusion criterion?  
""[No] The authors should state that they searched for reports regardless of their publication type. The authors should state whether or not they excluded any reports (from the systematic review), based on their publication status, language etc. Note: If review indicates that there was a search for “grey literature” or “unpublished literature,” indicate “yes.” SIGLE database, dissertations, conference proceedings, and trial registries are all considered grey for this purpose. If searching a source that contains both grey and non-grey, must specify that they were searching for grey/unpublished lit.""
Quotes: None.
Reasoning: No mention of searching or including grey literature.

A5. Was a list of studies (included and excluded) provided?
""[Yes] A list of included and excluded studies should be provided. Note: Acceptable if the excluded studies are referenced. If there is an electronic link to the list but the link is dead, select “no.”""
Quotes: ""Our electronic search yielded 342 studies. After applying our exclusion criteria to titles and abstracts, 63 studies remained. Full-text review resulted in eight of these studies being included, while an additional one was identified from hand-searching the reference sections of included articles; nine studies were ultimately included [10–12,14,23–27].""
Reasoning: Provided number of studies at each stage and cited included studies. 

A6. Were the characteristics of the included studies provided?
""[Yes] In an aggregated form such as a table, data from the original studies should be provided on the participants, interventions and outcomes. The ranges of characteristics in all the studies analyzed e.g., age, race, sex, relevant socioeconomic data, disease status, duration, severity, or other diseases should be reported. Note: Acceptable if not in table format as long as they are described as above.""
Quotes: ""The MINORS scores for our included studies ranged from 7 to 14, with a median score of 9 (Table 1)."" ""One hundred sixty-eight patients were asymptomatic at birth with sufficient data available for inclusion in our analyses.""
Reasoning: Provided characteristics of included studies in table and text.

A7. Was the scientific quality of the included studies assessed and documented?
""[Yes] 'A priori' methods of assessment should be provided (e.g., for effectiveness studies if the author(s) chose to include only randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled studies, or allocation concealment as inclusion criteria); for other types of studies alternative items will be relevant. Note: Can include use of a quality scoring tool or checklist, e.g., Jadad scale, risk of bias, sensitivity analysis, etc., or a description of quality items, with some kind of result for EACH study (“low” or “high” is fine, as long as it is clear which studies scored “low” and which scored “high”; a summary score/range for all studies is not acceptable).""
Quotes: ""We used the Methodological Index for Non-Randomized Studies (MINORS) to assess the quality of the included studies, as all were nonrandomized [18]."" ""Two researchers independently assessed each study using the MINORS criteria and discussed their score for each item to reach a consensus.""
Reasoning: Assessed quality of included studies using MINORS tool. Provided quality assessment for each study.

A8. Was the scientific quality of the included studies used appropriately in formulating conclusions?
""[Yes] The results of the methodological rigor and scientific quality should be considered in the analysis and the conclusions of the review, and explicitly stated in formulating recommendations. Note: Might say something such as “the results should be interpreted with caution due to poor quality of included studies.” Cannot score “yes” for this question if scored “no” for question A7.""
Quotes: ""Our results should be interpreted with caution owing to the nature of the included studies (in that all but one were retrospective).""  
Reasoning: Noted limitations of included studies being retrospective in interpreting results.

A9. Were the methods used to combine the findings of studies appropriate?
""[Yes] For the pooled results, a test should be done to ensure the studies were combinable, to assess their homogeneity (i.e., Chi-squared test for homogeneity, I2 ). If heterogeneity exists a random effects model should be used and/or the clinical appropriateness of combining should be taken into consideration (i.e., is it sensible to combine?). Note: Indicate “yes” if they mention or describe heterogeneity, i.e., if they explain that they cannot pool because of heterogeneity/variability between interventions.""
Quotes: ""We conducted our meta-analyses using Review Manager 5.3 [20], using random-effects models [21], to produce an odds ratio (OR) for morbidity, as this is a categorical variable, and a mean difference (MD) for length of stay, as this is a continuous variable, along with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We produced Chi 2 and I 2 values to assess homogeneity.""
Reasoning: Used random effects model and assessed heterogeneity using Chi2 and I2.

A10. Was the likelihood of publication bias assessed?
""[No] An assessment of publication bias should include a combination of graphical aids (e.g., funnel plot, other available tests) and/or statistical tests (e.g., Egger regression test, Hedges-Olken). Note: If no test values or funnel plot included, score “no”. Score “yes” if mentions that publication bias could not be assessed because there were fewer than 10 included studies.""  
Quotes: None.
Reasoning: No assessment of publication bias mentioned.

A11. Was the conflict of interest included?
""[No] Potential sources of support should be clearly acknowledged in both the systematic review and the included studies. Note: To get a “yes,” must indicate source of funding or support for the systematic review AND for each of the included studies.""
Quotes: ""The University of Ottawa Summer Studentship program provided financial support for this project.""
Reasoning: Only reported funding for systematic review itself, not for included studies.

P2. Structured summary: 
""[Yes] Provide a structured summary including, as applicable: background; objectives; data sources; study eligibility criteria, participants, and interventions; study appraisal and synthesis methods; results; limitations; conclusions and implications of key findings; systematic review registration number.""
Quotes: ""Background: The ideal management of infants born with asymptomatic congenital pulmonary airway malformation (CPAM) is controversial. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis comparing elective resection versus expectant management. Methods: We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, and PubMed for studies describing the management of asymptomatic CPAM and reporting on postoperative morbidity, mortality, and length of hospital stay (LOS). We performed meta-analyses when possible and provide a narrative summary of results. Results: One nonrandomized prospective and eight retrospective studies met our inclusion criteria. Out of 168 patients, 70 underwent surgery before symptoms developed with seven experiencing postoperative complications (10.0%); 63 developed symptoms while being managed expectantly and subsequently underwent surgery with 20 complications (31.8%). Thirty-five patients continued to be followed nonsurgically (three months to nine years of follow-up). Morbidity was higher with surgery after symptom development (6 studies; odds ratio 4.59, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.40 to 15.11, P b 0.01); there was no difference in LOS (3 studies; mean difference 4.96, 95% CI −1.75 to 11.67, P = 0.15). There were no related deaths. Conclusions: Elective resection of asymptomatic CPAM lesions is safe and prevents the risk of symptom development, which may result in a more complicated surgery and recovery.""
Reasoning: Structured abstract provided with all key elements.

P3. Introduction/Rationale:
""[Yes] Describe the rationale for the review in the context of what is already known.""
Quotes: ""Arguments favoring either elective surgery or expectant management of asymptomatic lesions are many. They include estimates that delaying surgery until symptom onset will result in a more complicated procedure with worse surgical outcomes [8–13], as well as counterarguments stating that, as rates of symptom development are largely unknown [14,15], intervening before symptoms appear may result in exposure of healthy patients to unnecessary surgical risks [15]. These differing viewpoints illustrate the lack of consensus as to whether surgical management or an expectant approach for asymptomatic CPAM is associated with a smaller risk of morbidity in the short and long term.""
Reasoning: Provided background and rationale.

A1. Was an 'a priori' design provided? 
""[Yes] The research question and inclusion criteria should be established before the conduct of the review. Note: Need to refer to a protocol, ethics approval, or pre-determined/a priori published research objectives to score a “yes.”""
Quotes: ""Our objective was to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of all published literature comparing the postoperative outcomes associated with elective surgery (while asymptomatic) versus those following surgery as part of expectant management (i.e., performing surgery only upon the development of symptoms) in children born with asymptomatic CPAM lesions.""
Reasoning: The objective and inclusion criteria were pre-specified.

A2. Was there duplicate study selection and data extraction?
""[Yes] There should be at least two independent data extractors and a consensus procedure for disagreements should be in place. Note: 2 people do study selection, 2 people do data extraction, consensus process or one person checks the other’s work.""
Quotes: ""Two independent reviewers conducted all article screening; where consensus on an article could not be reached, a third reviewer was consulted."" ""One reviewer extracted all data from the included studies, and another checked it for accuracy and completeness.""  
Reasoning: Two reviewers independently selected studies and extracted data.

A3. Was a comprehensive literature search performed?
""[Yes] At least two electronic sources should be searched. The report must include years and databases used (e.g., Central, EMBASE, and MEDLINE). Key words and/or MESH terms must be stated and where feasible the search strategy should be provided. All searches should be supplemented by consulting current contents, reviews, textbooks, specialized registers, or experts in the particular field of study, and by reviewing the references in the studies found. Note: If at least 2 sources + one supplementary strategy used, select “yes” (Cochrane register/Central counts as 2 sources; a grey literature search counts as supplementary).""
Quotes: ""We conducted an electronic literature search of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (1966 onwards), EMBASE (1980 onwards), CINAHL (1982 onwards), and PubMed (1966 onwards) in January 2015."" ""We used the search terms (“asymptomatic” AND “congenital” AND “cystic” AND “adenomatoid malformation”) OR (“lung” AND “lesion”) AND (“management” OR “treatment” OR “therapy.”)."" ""Finally, we hand-searched the reference sections of all relevant articles to identify additional studies.""
Reasoning: Searched multiple databases, reported search terms, and hand-searched references.

A4. Was the status of publication (i.e. grey literature) used as an inclusion criterion?  
""[No] The authors should state that they searched for reports regardless of their publication type. The authors should state whether or not they excluded any reports (from the systematic review), based on their publication status, language etc. Note: If review indicates that there was a search for “grey literature” or “unpublished literature,” indicate “yes.” SIGLE database, dissertations, conference proceedings, and trial registries are all considered grey for this purpose. If searching a source that contains both grey and non-grey, must specify that they were searching for grey/unpublished lit.""
Quotes: None.
Reasoning: No mention of searching or including grey literature.

A5. Was a list of studies (included and excluded) provided?
""[Yes] A list of included and excluded studies should be provided. Note: Acceptable if the excluded studies are referenced. If there is an electronic link to the list but the link is dead, select “no.”""
Quotes: ""Our electronic search yielded 342 studies. After applying our exclusion criteria to titles and abstracts, 63 studies remained. Full-text review resulted in eight of these studies being included, while an additional one was identified from hand-searching the reference sections of included articles; nine studies were ultimately included [10–12,14,23–27].""
Reasoning: Provided number of studies at each stage and cited included studies. 

A6. Were the characteristics of the included studies provided?
""[Yes] In an aggregated form such as a table, data from the original studies should be provided on the participants, interventions and outcomes. The ranges of characteristics in all the studies analyzed e.g., age, race, sex, relevant socioeconomic data, disease status, duration, severity, or other diseases should be reported. Note: Acceptable if not in table format as long as they are described as above.""
Quotes: ""The MINORS scores for our included studies ranged from 7 to 14, with a median score of 9 (Table 1)."" ""One hundred sixty-eight patients were asymptomatic at birth with sufficient data available for inclusion in our analyses.""
Reasoning: Provided characteristics of included studies in table and text.

A7. Was the scientific quality of the included studies assessed and documented?
""[Yes] 'A priori' methods of assessment should be provided (e.g., for effectiveness studies if the author(s) chose to include only randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled studies, or allocation concealment as inclusion criteria); for other types of studies alternative items will be relevant. Note: Can include use of a quality scoring tool or checklist, e.g., Jadad scale, risk of bias, sensitivity analysis, etc., or a description of quality items, with some kind of result for EACH study (“low” or “high” is fine, as long as it is clear which studies scored “low” and which scored “high”; a summary score/range for all studies is not acceptable).""
Quotes: ""We used the Methodological Index for Non-Randomized Studies (MINORS) to assess the quality of the included studies, as all were nonrandomized [18]."" ""Two researchers independently assessed each study using the MINORS criteria and discussed their score for each item to reach a consensus.""
Reasoning: Assessed quality of included studies using MINORS tool. Provided quality assessment for each study.

A8. Was the scientific quality of the included studies used appropriately in formulating conclusions?
""[Yes] The results of the methodological rigor and scientific quality should be considered in the analysis and the conclusions of the review, and explicitly stated in formulating recommendations. Note: Might say something such as “the results should be interpreted with caution due to poor quality of included studies.” Cannot score “yes” for this question if scored “no” for question A7.""
Quotes: ""Our results should be interpreted with caution owing to the nature of the included studies (in that all but one were retrospective).""  
Reasoning: Noted limitations of included studies being retrospective in interpreting results.

A9. Were the methods used to combine the findings of studies appropriate?
""[Yes] For the pooled results, a test should be done to ensure the studies were combinable, to assess their homogeneity (i.e., Chi-squared test for homogeneity, I2 ). If heterogeneity exists a random effects model should be used and/or the clinical appropriateness of combining should be taken into consideration (i.e., is it sensible to combine?). Note: Indicate “yes” if they mention or describe heterogeneity, i.e., if they explain that they cannot pool because of heterogeneity/variability between interventions.""
Quotes: ""We conducted our meta-analyses using Review Manager 5.3 [20], using random-effects models [21], to produce an odds ratio (OR) for morbidity, as this is a categorical variable, and a mean difference (MD) for length of stay, as this is a continuous variable, along with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We produced Chi 2 and I 2 values to assess homogeneity.""
Reasoning: Used random effects model and assessed heterogeneity using Chi2 and I2.

A10. Was the likelihood of publication bias assessed?
""[No] An assessment of publication bias should include a combination of graphical aids (e.g., funnel plot, other available tests) and/or statistical tests (e.g., Egger regression test, Hedges-Olken). Note: If no test values or funnel plot included, score “no”. Score “yes” if mentions that publication bias could not be assessed because there were fewer than 10 included studies.""  
Quotes: None.
Reasoning: No assessment of publication bias mentioned.

A11. Was the conflict of interest included?
""[No] Potential sources of support should be clearly acknowledged in both the systematic review and the included studies. Note: To get a “yes,” must indicate source of funding or support for the systematic review AND for each of the included studies.""
Quotes: ""The University of Ottawa Summer Studentship program provided financial support for this project.""
Reasoning: Only reported funding for systematic review itself, not for included studies.
