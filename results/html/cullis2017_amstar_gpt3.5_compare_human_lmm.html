<th style="text-align:left;">
</th>
<th style="text-align:left;">
<span style="border-bottom: 1px dashed black"
title="A1. Was an &#39;a priori&#39; design provided? The research question and inclusion criteria should be established before the conduct of the review. Note: Need to refer to a protocol, ethics approval, or pre-determined/a priori published research objectives to score a “yes.”">
A1</span>
</th>
<th style="text-align:left;">
<span style="border-bottom: 1px dashed black"
title="A2. Was there duplicate study selection and data extraction? There should be at least two independent data extractors and a consensus procedure for disagreements should be in place. Note: 2 people do study selection, 2 people do data extraction, consensus process or one person checks the other’s work.">
A2</span>
</th>
<th style="text-align:left;">
<span style="border-bottom: 1px dashed black"
title="A3. Was a comprehensive literature search performed? At least two electronic sources should be searched. The report must include years and databases used (e.g., Central, EMBASE, and MEDLINE). Key words and/or MESH terms must be stated and where feasible the search strategy should be provided. All searches should be supplemented by consulting current contents, reviews, textbooks, specialized registers, or experts in the particular field of study, and by reviewing the references in the studies found. Note: If at least 2 sources + one supplementary strategy used, select “yes” (Cochrane register/Central counts as 2 sources; a grey literature search counts as supplementary).">
A3</span>
</th>
<th style="text-align:left;">
<span style="border-bottom: 1px dashed black"
title="A4. Was the status of publication (i.e. grey literature) used as an inclusion criterion? The authors should state that they searched for reports regardless of their publication type. The authors should state whether or not they excluded any reports (from the systematic review), based on their publication status, language etc. Note: If review indicates that there was a search for “grey literature” or “unpublished literature,” indicate “yes.” SIGLE database, dissertations, conference proceedings, and trial registries are all considered grey for this purpose. If searching a source that contains both grey and non-grey, must specify that they were searching for grey/unpublished lit.">
A4</span>
</th>
<th style="text-align:left;">
<span style="border-bottom: 1px dashed black"
title="A5. Was a list of studies (included and excluded) provided? A list of included and excluded studies should be provided. Note: Acceptable if the excluded studies are referenced. If there is an electronic link to the list but the link is dead, select “no.”">
A5</span>
</th>
<th style="text-align:left;">
<span style="border-bottom: 1px dashed black"
title="A6. Were the characteristics of the included studies provided? In an aggregated form such as a table, data from the original studies should be provided on the participants, interventions and outcomes. The ranges of characteristics in all the studies analyzed e.g., age, race, sex, relevant socioeconomic data, disease status, duration, severity, or other diseases should be reported. Note: Acceptable if not in table format as long as they are described as above. Paul &quot;Follow-up poorly reported in general&quot;">
A6</span>
</th>
<th style="text-align:left;">
<span style="border-bottom: 1px dashed black"
title="A7. Was the scientific quality of the included studies assessed and documented? &#39;A priori&#39; methods of assessment should be provided (e.g., for effectiveness studies if the author(s) chose to include only randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled studies, or allocation concealment as inclusion criteria); for other types of studies alternative items will be relevant. Note: Can include use of a quality scoring tool or checklist, e.g., Jadad scale, risk of bias, sensitivity analysis, etc., or a description of quality items, with some kind of result for EACH study (“low” or “high” is fine, as long as it is clear which studies scored “low” and which scored “high”; a summary score/range for all studies is not acceptable).">
A7</span>
</th>
<th style="text-align:left;">
<span style="border-bottom: 1px dashed black"
title="A8. Was the scientific quality of the included studies used appropriately in formulating conclusions? The results of the methodological rigor and scientific quality should be considered in the analysis and the conclusions of the review, and explicitly stated in formulating recommendations. Note: Might say something such as “the results should be interpreted with caution due to poor quality of included studies.” Cannot score “yes” for this question if scored “no” for question A7.">
A8</span>
</th>
<th style="text-align:left;">
<span style="border-bottom: 1px dashed black"
title="A9. Were the methods used to combine the findings of studies appropriate? For the pooled results, a test should be done to ensure the studies were combinable, to assess their homogeneity (i.e., Chi-squared test for homogeneity, I2 ). If heterogeneity exists a random effects model should be used and/or the clinical appropriateness of combining should be taken into consideration (i.e., is it sensible to combine?). Note: Indicate “yes” if they mention or describe heterogeneity, i.e., if they explain that they cannot pool because of heterogeneity/variability between interventions.">
A9</span>
</th>
<th style="text-align:left;">
<span style="border-bottom: 1px dashed black"
title="A10. Was the likelihood of publication bias assessed? An assessment of publication bias should include a combination of graphical aids (e.g., funnel plot, other available tests) and/or statistical tests (e.g., Egger regression test, Hedges-Olken). Note: If no test values or funnel plot included, score “no”. Score “yes” if mentions that publication bias could not be assessed because there were fewer than 10 included studies.">
A10</span>
</th>
<th style="text-align:left;">
<span style="border-bottom: 1px dashed black"
title="A11. Was the conflict of interest included? Potential sources of support should be clearly acknowledged in both the systematic review and the included studies. Note: To get a “yes,” must indicate source of funding or support for the systematic review AND for each of the included studies.">

A1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎We performed a systematic review to examine the effectiveness of surgical interventions to treat obese children and adolescents, and whether they are cost-effective.&quot;</span>
This quote indicates that an a priori design was provided as the research question and inclusion criteria were established before conducting the review.

title="A9. Were the methods used to combine the findings of studies appropriate? For the pooled results, a test should be done to ensure the studies were combinable, to assess their homogeneity (i.e., Chi-squared test for homogeneity, I2 ). If heterogeneity exists a random effects model should be used and/or the clinical appropriateness of combining should be taken into consideration (i.e., is it sensible to combine?). Note: Indicate “yes” if they mention or describe heterogeneity, i.e., if they explain that they cannot pool because of heterogeneity/variability between interventions.">

title="A10. Was the likelihood of publication bias assessed? An assessment of publication bias should include a combination of graphical aids (e.g., funnel plot, other available tests) and/or statistical tests (e.g., Egger regression test, Hedges-Olken). Note: If no test values or funnel plot included, score “no”. Score “yes” if mentions that publication bias could not be assessed because there were fewer than 10 included studies.">

<pre>
A1. Was an 'a priori' design provided? The research question and inclusion criteria should be established before the conduct of the review. Note: Need to refer to a protocol, ethics approval, or pre-determined/a priori published research objectives to score a “yes.”

Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎We aim to comparatively review all published treatment options, and outcomes, for managing RTEF.&quot;</span>
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎All English language articles published by August 2013, irrespective of design, describing the management of, and outcome after, RTEF in children under 18 years were reviewed.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The review clearly states the research question and inclusion criteria.

Response: [Yes]

A2. Was there duplicate study selection and data extraction? There should be at least two independent data extractors and a consensus procedure for disagreements should be in place. Note: 2 people do study selection, 2 people do data extraction, consensus process or one person checks the other’s work.

Quotes:
- No quotes provided.

Reasoning: The review does not mention duplicate study selection and data extraction.

Response: [No]

A3. Was a comprehensive literature search performed? At least two electronic sources should be searched. The report must include years and databases used (e.g., Central, EMBASE, and MEDLINE). Key words and/or MESH terms must be stated and where feasible the search strategy should be provided. All searches should be supplemented by consulting current contents, reviews, textbooks, specialized registers, or experts in the particular field of study, and by reviewing the references in the studies found. Note: If at least 2 sources + one supplementary strategy used, select “yes” (Cochrane register/Central counts as 2 sources; a grey literature search counts as supplementary).

Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎A Medline, Embase, and web of science searches were performed using the keywords recurrent tracheoesophageal fistula.&quot;</span>
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎The index of all issues of the European Journal of Pediatric Surgery, Journal of Pediatric Surgery, Pediatric Surgery International, and the International Journal of Pediatric Otorhinolaryngology was searched for relevant articles; the reference list of all relevant articles was also searched.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The review performed a comprehensive literature search using multiple electronic sources and supplemented the search by consulting relevant journals and reference lists.

Response: [Yes]

A4. Was the status of publication (i.e. grey literature) used as an inclusion criterion? The authors should state that they searched for reports regardless of their publication type. The authors should state whether or not they excluded any reports (from the systematic review), based on their publication status, language etc. Note: If review indicates that there was a search for “grey literature” or “unpublished literature,” indicate “yes.” SIGLE database, dissertations, conference proceedings, and trial registries are all considered grey for this purpose. If searching a source that contains both grey and non-grey, must specify that they were searching for grey/unpublished lit.

Quotes:
- No quotes provided.

Reasoning: The review does not mention the status of publication as an inclusion criterion.

Response: [No]

A5. Was a list of studies (included and excluded) provided? A list of included and excluded studies should be provided. Note: Acceptable if the excluded studies are referenced. If there is an electronic link to the list but the link is dead, select “no.”

Quotes:
- No quotes provided.

Reasoning: The review does not provide a list of included and excluded studies.

Response: [No]

A6. Were the characteristics of the included studies provided? In an aggregated form such as a table, data from the original studies should be provided on the participants, interventions and outcomes. The ranges of characteristics in all the studies analyzed e.g., age, race, sex, relevant socioeconomic data, disease status, duration, severity, or other diseases should be reported. Note: Acceptable if not in table format as long as they are described as above.

Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎A total of 44 papers between 1955 and 2013 described 165 patients; 57 ET and 108 OS.&quot;</span>
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎The data obtained included number of patients treated, treatment modality employed, effectiveness of each treatment modality, and the outcomes after treatment.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The review provides the characteristics of the included studies, including the number of patients, treatment modalities, and outcomes.

Response: [Yes]

A7. Was the scientific quality of the included studies assessed and documented? 'A priori' methods of assessment should be provided (e.g., for effectiveness studies if the author(s) chose to include only randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled studies, or allocation concealment as inclusion criteria); for other types of studies alternative items will be relevant. Note: Can include use of a quality scoring tool or checklist, e.g., Jadad scale, risk of bias, sensitivity analysis, etc., or a description of quality items, with some kind of result for EACH study (“low” or “high” is fine, as long as it is clear which studies scored “low” and which scored “high”; a summary score/range for all studies is not acceptable).

Quotes:
- No quotes provided.

Reasoning: The review does not mention the assessment of the scientific quality of the included studies.

Response: [No]

A8. Was the scientific quality of the included studies used appropriately in formulating conclusions? The results of the methodological rigor and scientific quality should be considered in the analysis and the conclusions of the review, and explicitly stated in formulating recommendations. Note: Might say something such as “the results should be interpreted with caution due to poor quality of included studies.” Cannot score “yes” for this question if scored “no” for question A7.

Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎OS for RTEF has a low morbidity and mortality, a higher success rate, and requires fewer treatments than an endoscopic repair.&quot;</span>
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎The ideal ET is undecided but it remains a viable alternative provided treatment failures are anticipated and prompt redo treatments initiated to prevent ongoing respiratory morbidity.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The review does not explicitly state that the scientific quality of the included studies was used in formulating the conclusions.

Response: [No]

A9. Were the methods used to combine the findings of studies appropriate? For the pooled results, a test should be done to ensure the studies were combinable, to assess their homogeneity (i.e., Chi-squared test for homogeneity, I2 ). If heterogeneity exists a random effects model should be used and/or the clinical appropriateness of combining should be taken into consideration (i.e., is it sensible to combine?). Note: Indicate “yes” if they mention or describe heterogeneity, i.e., if they explain that they cannot pool because of heterogeneity/variability between interventions.

Quotes:
- No quotes provided.

Reasoning: The review does not mention the methods used to combine the findings of studies.

Response: [NA]

A10. Was the likelihood of publication bias assessed? An assessment of publication bias should include a combination of graphical aids (e.g., funnel plot, other available tests) and/or statistical tests (e.g., Egger regression test, Hedges-Olken). Note: If no test values or funnel plot included, score “no”. Score “yes” if mentions that publication bias could not be assessed because there were fewer than 10 included studies.

Quotes:
- No quotes provided.

Reasoning: The review does not mention the assessment of publication bias.

Response: [NA]

A11. Was the conflict of interest included? Potential sources of support should be clearly acknowledged in both the systematic review and the included studies. Note: To get a “yes,” must indicate source of funding or support for the systematic review AND for each of the included studies.

Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎Conflict of Interest: None.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The review clearly states that there is no conflict of interest.

For the pooled results, a test should be done to ensure the studies were combinable, to assess their homogeneity (i.e., Chi-squared test for homogeneity, I2 ). If heterogeneity exists a random effects model should be used and/or the clinical appropriateness of combining should be taken into consideration (i.e., is it sensible to combine?). Note: Indicate “yes” if they mention or describe heterogeneity, i.e., if they explain that they cannot pool because of heterogeneity/variability between interventions.">

title="A10. Was the likelihood of publication bias assessed? An assessment of publication bias should include a combination of graphical aids (e.g., funnel plot, other available tests) and/or statistical tests (e.g., Egger regression test, Hedges-Olken). Note: If no test values or funnel plot included, score “no”. Score “yes” if mentions that publication bias could not be assessed because there were fewer than 10 included studies.">

For the pooled results, a test should be done to ensure the studies were combinable, to assess their homogeneity (i.e., Chi-squared test for homogeneity, I2 ). If heterogeneity exists a random effects model should be used and/or the clinical appropriateness of combining should be taken into consideration (i.e., is it sensible to combine?).

An assessment of publication bias should include a combination of graphical aids (e.g., funnel plot, other available tests) and/or statistical tests (e.g., Egger regression test, Hedges-Olken). Note: If no test values or funnel plot included, score “no”. Score “yes” if mentions that publication bias could not be assessed because there were fewer than 10 included studies.">

Reasoning: The authors mention that they performed pooled analyses and report the results of these analyses.

Answer: [Yes]

A10. Was the likelihood of publication bias assessed? An assessment of publication bias should include a combination of graphical aids (e.g., funnel plot, other available tests) and/or statistical tests (e.g., Egger regression test, Hedges-Olken). Note: If no test values or funnel plot included, score “no”. Score “yes” if mentions that publication bias could not be assessed because there were fewer than 10 included studies.

Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎We analyzed the possible publication bias by generating funnel plots of the trials used for all of the evaluated comparisons of outcomes. No clear bias was apparent.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The authors mention that they analyzed the possible publication bias by generating funnel plots, but they do not provide any results or conclusions from this analysis.

Answer: [No]

A11. Was the conflict of interest included? Potential sources of support should be clearly acknowledged in both the systematic review and the included studies. Note: To get a “yes,” must indicate source of funding or support for the systematic review AND for each of the included studies.

Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎The study is partly funded by Taipei Tzu Chi Hospital, Buddhist Tzu Chi Medical Foundation. TCRD-TPE-103-RT-7.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The authors mention that the study was partly funded by Taipei Tzu Chi Hospital, Buddhist Tzu Chi Medical Foundation.

Overall, the methodological quality of the systematic review is moderate. The review had a clear 'a priori' design, performed a comprehensive literature search, provided a list of included studies, and described the characteristics of the included studies. However, the review did not assess the scientific quality of the included studies or use it appropriately in formulating conclusions. Additionally, the review did not assess publication bias or report any conflicts of interest.</pre>

<pre>
A1. Was an 'a priori' design provided?
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎The authors collected all studies published since 1992 that compared SILA versus TILA to perform a meta-analysis and investigated the safety and efficacy of two approaches in the treatment of appendicitis.&quot;</span> 
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎The publications were identified by searching the major medical databases such as MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library for relevant papers published between January 1992 and July 2012.&quot;</span>
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎Inclusion criteria were: (1) clinical studies that compared single-incision versus conventional three-incision laparoscopic appendicectomy for appendicitis between 1992 and 2012; (2) patients with primary appendicitis; and (3) raw data included some of the following: operative parameters, postoperative recovery, postoperative complications, postoperative pain and hospital charges.&quot;</span>
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎Exclusion criteria were: (1) no three-incision laparoscopic appendicectomy as a control; (2) secondary appendicitis; (3) duplicate publication or the publication did not provide sufficient data.&quot;</span>
[Yes] The study clearly states the research question, inclusion criteria, and search strategy used to identify relevant studies.

A2. Was there duplicate study selection and data extraction?
- No information provided.
[No] No information is provided about duplicate study selection and data extraction.

A3. Was a comprehensive literature search performed?
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎The publications were identified by searching the major medical databases such as MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library for relevant papers published between January 1992 and July 2012.&quot;</span>
[Yes] The study performed a comprehensive literature search by searching multiple databases and specifying the time frame.

A4. Was the status of publication (i.e. grey literature) used as an inclusion criterion?
- No information provided.
[NA] The study does not mention the use of grey literature as an inclusion criterion.

A5. Was a list of studies (included and excluded) provided?
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎According to the search strategy and inclusion criteria, a total of 17 studies [5], [15], [16], [17], [18], [19], [20], [21], [22], [23], [24], [25], [26], [27], [28], [29], [30] that included 1809 appendicectomy cases (793 SILA and 1016 TILA) were considered suitable for meta-analysis.&quot;</span>
[Yes] The study provides a list of included studies.

A6. Were the characteristics of the included studies provided?
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎The characteristics of the 17 studies (1 randomized controlled trial [22] and 16 retrospective studies [5], [15], [16], [17], [18], [19], [20], [21], [23], [24], [25], [26], [27], [28], [29], [30]) are shown in Table 1.&quot;</span>
[Yes] The study provides the characteristics of the included studies in a table.

A7. Was the scientific quality of the included studies assessed and documented?
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎We used a star scoring system [12] based on criteria related to study design, comparability of patient groups, and outcome assessment to assess literature quality. The total score was 9 stars, and the quality of each study was graded as level 1 (0–5 stars) or level 2 (6–9 stars).&quot;</span>
[Yes] The study assessed the scientific quality of the included studies using a star scoring system.

A8. Was the scientific quality of the included studies used appropriately in formulating conclusions?
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎Compared with TILA, SILA has the advantage of shorter hospital stay, and it can achieve comparable operative time, blood loss, postoperative recovery, postoperative pain and complications with TILA. The drawback is that SILA is associated with higher conversion rate, and perhaps higher surgical difficulty and hospitalization costs.&quot;</span>
[Yes] The study appropriately considers the scientific quality of the included studies in formulating conclusions.

A9. Were the methods used to combine the findings of studies appropriate?
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎The random-effect model was used to combine the data due to evident heterogeneity.&quot;</span>
[Yes] The study used appropriate methods to combine the findings of studies by using a random-effect model to account for heterogeneity.

A10. Was the likelihood of publication bias assessed?
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎The funnel plot of standard of error by effect size for the measurements of wound infection, showed an equal distribution of studies around the middle line, indicating that publication bias was not evident.&quot;</span>
[Yes] The study assessed the likelihood of publication bias using a funnel plot.

A11. Was the conflict of interest included?
- No information provided.
[NA] The study does not mention the conflict of interest.

Overall, the methodological quality of the systematic review is moderate. The study provides a clear research question, inclusion criteria, and comprehensive literature search. However, there is no information about duplicate study selection and data extraction, and the conflict of interest is not mentioned.</pre>

<p><i><span style="border-bottom: 1px dashed black;">6 quote(s) from
publication full text</span> (mean similarity 100%)</i></p>
<pre>
A1. Was an 'a priori' design provided? The research question and inclusion criteria should be established before the conduct of the review. Note: Need to refer to a protocol, ethics approval, or pre-determined/a priori published research objectives to score a “yes.”

Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎The aim of our study was to evaluate the availability of Level 1 studies comparing laparoscopic procedures with the corresponding open operation in pediatric surgery.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The aim of the study is clearly stated, indicating that an 'a priori' design was provided.

Response: [Yes]

A2. Was there duplicate study selection and data extraction? There should be at least two independent data extractors and a consensus procedure for disagreements should be in place. Note: 2 people do study selection, 2 people do data extraction, consensus process or one person checks the other’s work.

Quotes:
- No quotes provided.

Reasoning: No information is provided about duplicate study selection and data extraction.

Response: [No]

A3. Was a comprehensive literature search performed? At least two electronic sources should be searched. The report must include years and databases used (e.g., Central, EMBASE, and MEDLINE). Key words and/or MESH terms must be stated and where feasible the search strategy should be provided. All searches should be supplemented by consulting current contents, reviews, textbooks, specialized registers, or experts in the particular field of study, and by reviewing the references in the studies found. Note: If at least 2 sources + one supplementary strategy used, select “yes” (Cochrane register/Central counts as 2 sources; a grey literature search counts as supplementary).

Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎Clinical Level 1 studies (SR, MA, and RCT) published in the English literature were identified through a Medline literature search using PubMed (www.pubmed.com).&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The study used a comprehensive literature search by searching PubMed, a widely used database for medical literature.

Response: [Yes]

A4. Was the status of publication (i.e. grey literature) used as an inclusion criterion? The authors should state that they searched for reports regardless of their publication type. The authors should state whether or not they excluded any reports (from the systematic review), based on their publication status, language etc. Note: If review indicates that there was a search for “grey literature” or “unpublished literature,” indicate “yes.” SIGLE database, dissertations, conference proceedings, and trial registries are all considered grey for this purpose. If searching a source that contains both grey and non-grey, must specify that they were searching for grey/unpublished lit.

Quotes:
- No quotes provided.

Reasoning: No information is provided about the status of publication being used as an inclusion criterion.

Response: [No]

A5. Was a list of studies (included and excluded) provided? A list of included and excluded studies should be provided. Note: Acceptable if the excluded studies are referenced. If there is an electronic link to the list but the link is dead, select “no.”

Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎A total of 20 manuscripts met the inclusion criteria (9 MA and 11 RCT).&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The number of included studies is provided, but there is no information about excluded studies.

Response: [No]

A6. Were the characteristics of the included studies provided? In an aggregated form such as a table, data from the original studies should be provided on the participants, interventions and outcomes. The ranges of characteristics in all the studies analyzed e.g., age, race, sex, relevant socioeconomic data, disease status, duration, severity, or other diseases should be reported. Note: Acceptable if not in table format as long as they are described as above.

Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎Endpoints of the study were advantages and disadvantages of laparoscopy compared with the open operation.&quot;</span>
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎The main results of the studies with regard to advantages and disadvantages of laparoscopic compared with open surgery are summarized in alphabetical order.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The characteristics of the included studies are not provided in an aggregated form or described in detail.

Response: [No]

A7. Was the scientific quality of the included studies assessed and documented? 'A priori' methods of assessment should be provided (e.g., for effectiveness studies if the author(s) chose to include only randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled studies, or allocation concealment as inclusion criteria); for other types of studies alternative items will be relevant. Note: Can include use of a quality scoring tool or checklist, e.g., Jadad scale, risk of bias, sensitivity analysis, etc., or a description of quality items, with some kind of result for EACH study (“low” or “high” is fine, as long as it is clear which studies scored “low” and which scored “high”; a summary score/range for all studies is not acceptable).

Quotes:
- No quotes provided.

Reasoning: No information is provided about the scientific quality of the included studies being assessed and documented.

Response: [No]

A8. Was the scientific quality of the included studies used appropriately in formulating conclusions? The results of the methodological rigor and scientific quality should be considered in the analysis and the conclusions of the review, and explicitly stated in formulating recommendations. Note: Might say something such as “the results should be interpreted with caution due to poor quality of included studies.” Cannot score “yes” for this question if scored “no” for question A7.

Quotes:
- No quotes provided.

Reasoning: No information is provided about the scientific quality of the included studies being used in formulating conclusions.

Response: [No]

A9. Were the methods used to combine the findings of studies appropriate? For the pooled results, a test should be done to ensure the studies were combinable, to assess their homogeneity (i.e., Chi-squared test for homogeneity, I2 ). If heterogeneity exists a random effects model should be used and/or the clinical appropriateness of combining should be taken into consideration (i.e., is it sensible to combine?). Note: Indicate “yes” if they mention or describe heterogeneity, i.e., if they explain that they cannot pool because of heterogeneity/variability between interventions.

Quotes:
- No quotes provided.

Reasoning: No information is provided about the methods used to combine the findings of studies.

Response: [NA]

A10. Was the likelihood of publication bias assessed? An assessment of publication bias should include a combination of graphical aids (e.g., funnel plot, other available tests) and/or statistical tests (e.g., Egger regression test, Hedges-Olken). Note: If no test values or funnel plot included, score “no”. Score “yes” if mentions that publication bias could not be assessed because there were fewer than 10 included studies.

Quotes:
- No quotes provided.

Reasoning: No information is provided about the likelihood of publication bias being assessed.

Response: [NA]

A11. Was the conflict of interest included? Potential sources of support should be clearly acknowledged in both the systematic review and the included studies. Note: To get a “yes,” must indicate source of funding or support for the systematic review AND for each of the included studies.

Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎Conflict of Interest: None&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The conflict of interest is clearly stated as none.

Summary: The systematic review and meta-analysis in this study have several methodological limitations. While it had an a priori design, duplicate study selection, and data extraction, and performed a comprehensive literature search, it did not provide a list of excluded studies, assess the scientific quality of the included studies, use the scientific quality in formulating conclusions, assess publication bias, or report conflicts of interest.</pre>

A3. Was a comprehensive literature search performed?
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎A systematic literature search was performed to identify articles reporting cases of LGEA managed by DPA. Common electronic databases as MEDLINE®, EMBASE®, ISI Web of ScienceSM and the Cochrane Library were searched in December 2011 using a combination of the following terms: “esophageal atresia”, “long-gap” and “delayed primary anastomosis”. References lists of identified articles were screened for additional studies.&quot;</span>
- Yes, a comprehensive literature search was performed.

A4. Was the status of publication (i.e. grey literature) used as an inclusion criterion?

A5. Was a list of studies (included and excluded) provided?
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎The literature search resulted in a total of 223 articles, of which 207 were identified by electronic database search and 16 by cross-referencing (Fig. 2). After removal of 117 duplicates, 106 titles, key words and abstracts were reviewed. Of these, 60 articles were excluded because after screening it emerged that these studies clearly did not meet the inclusion criteria as described. Forty-six articles met our criteria for inclusion and the full-text was examined more in detail.&quot;</span>

A7. Was the scientific quality of the included studies assessed and documented?
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎There are few prospective series, amounting to only 37 patients. Well-designed prospective comparative studies are lacking, major and minor postoperative complications are sometimes not properly defined, follow-up data are often deficient and when presented they are not homogenously described in the different studies.&quot;</span>
- <span style='background-color: #ffe9e2' title='Added squared brackets during extraction'>[No]</span>, there is no mention of the scientific quality of the included studies being assessed or documented.

- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎Comparison is challenging as outcomes are reported differently. GPU and CI appear comparable regarding the main outcomes of the present study: postoperative mortality, anastomotic complications, and graft loss. GPU seems to be associated with a higher respiratory morbidity but fewer gastrointestinal complications than CI.&quot;</span>
- <span style='background-color: #ffe9e2' title='Added squared brackets during extraction'>[Yes]</span>, the scientific quality of the included studies is used appropriately in formulating conclusions.

A9. Were the methods used to combine the findings of studies appropriate?
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎However there are only two studies regarding JI and the reported results differ widely. Because of this large divergence in results, calculating only an overall weighted mean using a random effects model seems inappropriate.&quot;</span>
- <span style='background-color: #ffe9e2' title='Added squared brackets during extraction'>[No]</span>, the methods used to combine the findings of studies are not appropriate as there is heterogeneity in the reported results.

A10. Was the likelihood of publication bias assessed?
- No information is provided in the text regarding the assessment of publication bias.
- <span style='background-color: #ffe9e2' title='Added squared brackets during extraction'>[NA]</span>, the text does not mention the assessment of publication bias.

A11. Was the conflict of interest included?
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎Conflict of Interest: None&quot;</span>
- <span style='background-color: #ffe9e2' title='Added squared brackets during extraction'>[Yes]</span>, the conflict of interest is included.

Overall, the methodological quality of this systematic review is moderate. The review clearly states its objective and design, performs a comprehensive literature search, provides a list of included studies, and describes the characteristics of the included studies. However, there is no evidence of duplicate study selection and data extraction, the scientific quality of the included studies is not assessed or documented, the methods used to combine the findings of studies are not appropriate, and there is no mention of the assessment of publication bias.</pre>

Overall, the systematic review adequately addressed 6 out of the 11 AMSTAR criteria. The review had an 'a priori' design, performed duplicate study selection and data extraction, conducted a comprehensive literature search, provided the characteristics of the included studies, assessed the scientific quality of the included studies, and assessed the likelihood of publication bias. However, the review did not provide a list of included and excluded studies, did not use the scientific quality of the included studies in formulating conclusions, and did not include conflict of interest statements. Additionally, the review did not mention the use of publication status as an inclusion criterion.</pre>

Overall, this systematic review has several limitations. While it provided an 'a priori' design and conducted a comprehensive literature search, it did not perform duplicate study selection and data extraction, did not assess the scientific quality of the included studies, and did not appropriately use the scientific quality in formulating conclusions. Additionally, it did not provide a list of included and excluded studies, did not assess publication bias, and did not report on the methods used to combine the findings of studies.</pre>

Overall, the systematic review provides some information on the methodology used (A1, A2, A3, A5, A6, A11), but lacks information on the scientific quality assessment of the included studies and the use of this assessment in formulating conclusions (A7, A8). The review also does not provide information on the methods used to combine the findings of studies or the assessment of publication bias (A9, A10).</pre>

In summary, the systematic review adequately addressed some of the AMSTAR criteria, such as having an 'a priori' design, duplicate study selection and data extraction, a comprehensive literature search, providing a list of included studies, and describing the characteristics of the included studies. However, it did not assess the scientific quality of the included studies, use the scientific quality appropriately in formulating conclusions, assess the likelihood of publication bias, or include information about conflicts of interest.</pre>

- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎A systematic review and cumulative meta-analysis was performed, including all articles describing the Foker technique or delayed primary anastomosis.&quot;</span> 

[Yes] The review clearly states that a systematic review and meta-analysis were performed, indicating that an a priori design was provided.

A2. Was there duplicate study selection and data extraction? There should be at least two independent data extractors and a consensus procedure for disagreements should be in place. Note: 2 people do study selection, 2 people do data extraction, consensus process or one person checks the other’s work.

- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎Authors extracted data from the retrieved articles. We contacted the primary authors of any articles for which there was inadequate information, or if relevant data could not be extracted.&quot;</span>

[No] The text does not mention duplicate study selection or data extraction, nor does it mention a consensus procedure for disagreements.

A3. Was a comprehensive literature search performed? At least two electronic sources should be searched. The report must include years and databases used (e.g., Central, EMBASE, and MEDLINE). Key words and/or MESH terms must be stated and where feasible the search strategy should be provided. All searches should be supplemented by consulting current contents, reviews, textbooks, specialized registers, or experts in the particular field of study, and by reviewing the references in the studies found. Note: If at least 2 sources + one supplementary strategy used, select “yes” (Cochrane register/Central counts as 2 sources; a grey literature search counts as supplementary).

- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎All publications describing both surgical procedures were sought from the Cochrane Trials Register and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials database. All studies were identified through electronic searches of MEDLINE (1966 onward), Embase (1980 onward), and CINAHL (1982 onward), and from hand searching journals and conference proceedings.&quot;</span>

[Yes] The text clearly states that a comprehensive literature search was performed, including searching multiple electronic sources (Cochrane Trials Register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, Embase, and CINAHL) as well as hand searching journals and conference proceedings.

A4. Was the status of publication (i.e. grey literature) used as an inclusion criterion? The authors should state that they searched for reports regardless of their publication type. The authors should state whether or not they excluded any reports (from the systematic review), based on their publication status, language etc. Note: If review indicates that there was a search for “grey literature” or “unpublished literature,” indicate “yes.” SIGLE database, dissertations, conference proceedings, and trial registries are all considered grey for this purpose. If searching a source that contains both grey and non-grey, must specify that they were searching for grey/unpublished lit.

- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎Letters, editorials, commentaries, reviews, and lectures that did not contain original research data were excluded.&quot;</span>

[No] The text does not mention explicitly searching for grey literature or unpublished literature.

A5. Was a list of studies (included and excluded) provided? A list of included and excluded studies should be provided. Note: Acceptable if the excluded studies are referenced. If there is an electronic link to the list but the link is dead, select “no.”

- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎The literature search resulted in a total of 115 articles, after screening and exclusion of nonrelevant and duplicate publications. Six articles met our criteria for inclusion and the full text was examined more in detail.&quot;</span>

[Yes] The text states that a total of 115 articles were screened and excluded, and 6 articles met the criteria for inclusion. Although a list of included and excluded studies is not provided, the number of articles included and excluded is mentioned.

A6. Were the characteristics of the included studies provided? In an aggregated form such as a table, data from the original studies should be provided on the participants, interventions and outcomes. The ranges of characteristics in all the studies analyzed e.g., age, race, sex, relevant socioeconomic data, disease status, duration, severity, or other diseases should be reported. Note: Acceptable if not in table format as long as they are described as above.

- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎The overall numbers of study subjects managed in these publications were 71 infants, ranging from 1 to 60 newborns with long-gap EA per study. All infants had long-gap EA without TEF. Data about the initial gap length were reported in all studies with a mean of 5.4 cm (range 3–12.5 cm). No study reported data about the preoperative gap length. The time until an anastomosis could be achieved was reported in all studies with a mean of 14 ± 8.2 days. The follow-up time was 5 years (range 0.2–10 years).&quot;</span>

[Yes] The text provides the characteristics of the included studies, including the number of study subjects, the initial gap length, the time until anastomosis, and the follow-up time.

A7. Was the scientific quality of the included studies assessed and documented? 'A priori' methods of assessment should be provided (e.g., for effectiveness studies if the author(s) chose to include only randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled studies, or allocation concealment as inclusion criteria); for other types of studies alternative items will be relevant. Note: Can include use of a quality scoring tool or checklist, e.g., Jadad scale, risk of bias, sensitivity analysis, etc., or a description of quality items, with some kind of result for EACH study (“low” or “high” is fine, as long as it is clear which studies scored “low” and which scored “high”; a summary score/range for all studies is not acceptable).

- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎Our methodological assessment revealed that the studies ranged from poor to moderate quality.&quot;</span>

[Yes] The text states that a methodological assessment was performed and that the studies ranged from poor to moderate quality.

A8. Was the scientific quality of the included studies used appropriately in formulating conclusions? The results of the methodological rigor and scientific quality should be considered in the analysis and the conclusions of the review, and explicitly stated in formulating recommendations. Note: Might say something such as “the results should be interpreted with caution due to poor quality of included studies.” Cannot score “yes” for this question if scored “no” for question A7.

- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎The use of mechanical traction appears to be at least as effective as delayed primary anastomosis for the management of long-gap EA. Future prospective studies and the establishment of a prospective registry are required to further elucidate this issue.&quot;</span>

[Yes] The text considers the scientific quality of the included studies and states that future prospective studies are required to further elucidate the issue.

A9. Were the methods used to combine the findings of studies appropriate? For the pooled results, a test should be done to ensure the studies were combinable, to assess their homogeneity (i.e., Chi-squared test for homogeneity, I2 ). If heterogeneity exists a random effects model should be used and/or the clinical appropriateness of combining should be taken into consideration (i.e., is it sensible to combine?). Note: Indicate “yes” if they mention or describe heterogeneity, i.e., if they explain that they cannot pool because of heterogeneity/variability between interventions.

- Not applicable <span style='background-color: #ff9e81' title='Added response during extraction'>[NA]</span>. The text does not mention combining the findings of studies or assessing heterogeneity.

A10. Was the likelihood of publication bias assessed? An assessment of publication bias should include a combination of graphical aids (e.g., funnel plot, other available tests) and/or statistical tests (e.g., Egger regression test, Hedges-Olken). Note: If no test values or funnel plot included, score “no”. Score “yes” if mentions that publication bias could not be assessed because there were fewer than 10 included studies.

- Not applicable <span style='background-color: #ff9e81' title='Added response during extraction'>[NA]</span>. The text does not mention assessing publication bias.

A11. Was the conflict of interest included? Potential sources of support should be clearly acknowledged in both the systematic review and the included studies. Note: To get a “yes,” must indicate source of funding or support for the systematic review AND for each of the included studies.

- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎Conflict of Interest: None&quot;</span>

[Yes] The text clearly states that there is no conflict of interest.

Overall, the methodological quality of the systematic review is moderate. The review provides an a priori design, a comprehensive literature search, and the characteristics of the included studies. However, it does not mention duplicate study selection or data extraction, the assessment of publication bias, or the use of methods to combine the findings of studies. The scientific quality of the included studies is assessed and used appropriately in formulating conclusions. The review does not mention the conflict of interest.</pre>

A1. Was an 'a priori' design provided?
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎The aim of our study was to compare recurrence, small bowel obstruction (SBO), and mortality rates for CDH repair between an absorbable (Surgisis [SIS]; Cook Biotech, Inc, West Lafayette, IN) and a nonabsorbable polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) (Gore-Tex; W.L. Gore & Associates, Inc, Neward, DE) material at our institution.&quot;</span> 
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎Because the condition is rare and single institution numbers are small, we also combined our data with the published literature to perform a meta-analysis comparing both materials in terms of CDH recurrence and SBO.&quot;</span>
- <span style='background-color: #ffe9e2' title='Added squared brackets during extraction'>[Yes]</span>, the study had a clear research question and design.

A2. Was there duplicate study selection and data extraction?

A3. Was a comprehensive literature search performed?
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎All publications describing both absorbable (SIS) and nonabsorbable (PTFE) material for treatment of CDH were sought from the Cochrane Trials Register and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) database. All studies were identified through electronic searches of MEDLINE (1966 onwards), EMBASE (1980 onwards), and CINAHL (1982 onwards) and from hand-searching journals and conference proceedings.&quot;</span>
- <span style='background-color: #ffe9e2' title='Added squared brackets during extraction'>[Yes]</span>, a comprehensive literature search was performed using multiple databases and additional sources.

- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎Our data further support the concept that there is no ideal prosthetic material for patch repair of CDH. Surgisis and PTFE had similarly high complication rates in terms of recurrence, SBO, and mortality. The meta-analysis performed further supported the lack of difference in these outcomes between absorbable and nonabsorbable materials.&quot;</span>

Abstracts of the unfiltered literature were reviewed and full text versions of selected publications were assessed for inclusion. Reference lists of these publications were also checked to identify additional relevant reports.&quot;</span>
- The authors describe a comprehensive literature search that includes multiple databases, manual searching, and checking reference lists.

[Yes]

Overall assessment: 
- The systematic review lacks important methodological components, such as duplicate study selection and data extraction, assessment of scientific quality of included studies, and assessment of publication bias. 
- The review does provide a comprehensive literature search and includes characteristics of the included studies. 
- However, without information on the scientific quality of the included studies, it is difficult to determine the reliability of the review's conclusions.</pre>

title="A9. Were the methods used to combine the findings of studies appropriate? For the pooled results, a test should be done to ensure the studies were combinable, to assess their homogeneity (i.e., Chi-squared test for homogeneity, I2 ). If heterogeneity exists a random effects model should be used and/or the clinical appropriateness of combining should be taken into consideration (i.e., is it sensible to combine?). Note: Indicate “yes” if they mention or describe heterogeneity, i.e., if they explain that they cannot pool because of heterogeneity/variability between interventions.">

title="A10. Was the likelihood of publication bias assessed? An assessment of publication bias should include a combination of graphical aids (e.g., funnel plot, other available tests) and/or statistical tests (e.g., Egger regression test, Hedges-Olken). Note: If no test values or funnel plot included, score “no”. Score “yes” if mentions that publication bias could not be assessed because there were fewer than 10 included studies.">

publication full text</span> (mean similarity 100%)</i></p>
<pre>
A1. Was an 'a priori' design provided?
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎We conducted a systematic review to assess the impact of a laparoscopic repair on rates of mucosal prolapse and defection dysfunction of male children born with RB/RP-ARMs (i.e., require an abdominal approach to their repair, either through laparoscopy or laparotomy).&quot;</span> This indicates that the research question and inclusion criteria were established before the conduct of the review. [Yes]

A2. Was there duplicate study selection and data extraction?
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎Full-text screening, data abstraction and quality appraisal were conducted in duplicate.&quot;</span> This indicates that there were at least two independent data extractors. [Yes]

A3. Was a comprehensive literature search performed?
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎A comprehensive search was conducted of MEDLINE/PubMed, EMBASE/OVID and CENTRAL (the Cochrane Library) electronic databases from 2000 to March 2014.&quot;</span> This indicates that at least two electronic sources were searched. [Yes]

A4. Was the status of publication (i.e. grey literature) used as an inclusion criterion?
- No information is provided about whether the status of publication was used as an inclusion criterion. [No]

A5. Was a list of studies (included and excluded) provided?
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎We identified 3,681 potential citations through database searches. This resulted in 97 studies; hand-searching bibliographies of these papers resulted in an additional 15 articles for full text screening. Of these, seven studies (N = 187) were eligible for inclusion and final analysis.&quot;</span> This indicates that a list of included studies was provided. [Yes]

A6. Were the characteristics of the included studies provided?
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎Patient characteristics of the included studies are summarized in Tables 1 and 2.&quot;</span> This indicates that the characteristics of the included studies were provided. [Yes]

A7. Was the scientific quality of the included studies assessed and documented?
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎We appraised the quality of reporting of the included studies in duplicate (AS and ML), with discrepancies resolved by discussion and consensus. We used the Methodological Index for Nonrandomized Studies (MINORS).&quot;</span> This indicates that the scientific quality of the included studies was assessed using a quality scoring tool. [Yes]

A8. Was the scientific quality of the included studies used appropriately in formulating conclusions?
- No information is provided about whether the scientific quality of the included studies was used appropriately in formulating conclusions. [NA]

A9. Were the methods used to combine the findings of studies appropriate?
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎Case series and observational studies are inherently heterogeneous, thus we decided a priori to use a random-effects model to account for between-study heterogeneity.&quot;</span> This indicates that the methods used to combine the findings of studies were appropriate. [Yes]

A10. Was the likelihood of publication bias assessed?
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎Due to the small number of studies included in this review (<10), funnel plots to evaluate publication bias were not constructed as they would be non-informative.&quot;</span> This indicates that the likelihood of publication bias was not assessed. [No]

A11. Was the conflict of interest included?
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎No studies reported on conflict of interest.&quot;</span> This indicates that the conflict of interest was not included. [No]

In summary, the systematic review adequately addressed 7 out of the 11 AMSTAR criteria. The review provided an a priori design, conducted duplicate study selection and data extraction, performed a comprehensive literature search, provided a list of included studies, provided the characteristics of the included studies, assessed the scientific quality of the included studies, and used appropriate methods to combine the findings of studies. However, the review did not use the scientific quality of the included studies appropriately in formulating conclusions, did not assess the likelihood of publication bias, and did not include information on conflict of interest.</pre>

<pre>
A1. Was an 'a priori' design provided?
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎A systematic review of the published literature between January 2000 and December 2008 was undertaken.&quot;</span> 
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎Prospective studies with at least 25 patients in each of the PD and LAP arms were selected.&quot;</span>
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎All sources that met selection criteria were analyzed.&quot;</span>
- [Yes] The review clearly states that a systematic review was conducted with predefined inclusion criteria.

A2. Was there duplicate study selection and data extraction?
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎Two reviewers (JES, LGK), using a predefined data extraction form, extracted data from the publications.&quot;</span>
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎Inter-observer agreement was high. Discrepancies were resolved by consensus after discussion.&quot;</span>
- [Yes] There were two independent reviewers involved in study selection and data extraction, and disagreements were resolved through consensus.

A3. Was a comprehensive literature search performed?
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎The Ovid (Ovid Technologies New York, NY) and Medline search engines were used to examine both the Pubmed and Cochrane libraries from January 2000 to December 2008.&quot;</span>
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎Abstracts were screened and the bibliographies examined to identify any additional trials.&quot;</span>
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎All sources that met selection criteria were analyzed.&quot;</span>
- [Yes] The review used multiple electronic sources, supplemented by screening abstracts and examining bibliographies, to perform a comprehensive literature search.

A4. Was the status of publication (i.e. grey literature) used as an inclusion criterion?
- No information is provided about the inclusion or exclusion of grey literature.
- [No] The review does not mention whether grey literature was included or excluded.

A5. Was a list of studies (included and excluded) provided?
- No list of included or excluded studies is provided.
- [No] The review does not provide a list of included and excluded studies.

A6. Were the characteristics of the included studies provided?
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎Table 1 describes the characteristics of the included studies.&quot;</span>
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎The sample size of the trials ranged from 65 to 156 patients per trial for a combined 523 participants for comparison of PD (273) and LAP (250).&quot;</span>
- [Yes] The review provides a table with the characteristics of the included studies, including sample size and number of participants in each treatment arm.

A7. Was the scientific quality of the included studies assessed and documented?
- No information is provided about the assessment of scientific quality of the included studies.
- [No] The review does not mention any assessment of the scientific quality of the included studies.

A8. Was the scientific quality of the included studies used appropriately in formulating conclusions?
- No information is provided about the use of scientific quality in formulating conclusions.
- [NA] Since there is no information about the assessment of scientific quality, it cannot be determined if it was used appropriately in formulating conclusions.

A9. Were the methods used to combine the findings of studies appropriate?
- <span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 97.7%):

(Copenhagen: The Nordic Cochrane Centre, The Cochrane Collaboration, 2008) was utilized to perform the meta-analysi' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;‎Review Manager (RevMan) software version 5.0 was utilized to perform the meta-analysis.&quot;</span>
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎Comparisons of dichotomous data were carried out using the Mantel-Haenszel statistical method under assumption of fixed effect analysis model.&quot;</span>
- [Yes] The review used appropriate methods, including meta-analysis, to combine the findings of the included studies.

A10. Was the likelihood of publication bias assessed?
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎The funnel plot depicted in Fig. 2 captures the information needed for a visual assessment of publication bias.&quot;</span>
- [No] Although a funnel plot is mentioned, there is no mention of any statistical tests or formal assessment of publication bias.

A11. Was the conflict of interest included?
- No information is provided about conflicts of interest.
- [NA] Since there is no information about conflicts of interest, it cannot be determined if they were included.

In summary, the methodological quality of this systematic review is mixed. While it provides an a priori design, duplicate study selection and data extraction, a comprehensive literature search, and characteristics of the included studies, it lacks information on the assessment of scientific quality, the use of scientific quality in formulating conclusions, the assessment of publication bias, and conflicts of interest.</pre>

- <span style='background-color: #ffe9e2' title='Added squared brackets during extraction'>[No]</span>, the scientific quality of the included studies was not assessed or documented.

A8. Was the scientific quality of the included studies used appropriately in formulating conclusions?
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎Balloon dilatation for anastomotic strictures post-oesophageal atresia repair is safe, and associated with a low perforation and mortality rates, and approximately three dilatations are required per child.&quot;</span>
- <span style='background-color: #ffe9e2' title='Added squared brackets during extraction'>[No]</span>, the scientific quality of the included studies was not used appropriately in formulating conclusions.

A9. Were the methods used to combine the findings of studies appropriate?
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎We aimed to include both randomised and non-randomised studies as relevant to this review.&quot;</span>

- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎Even though RCTs are the highest level of evidence, it should be recognised that data from non‐randomised studies on the use of MIS in different types of solid intra‐thoracic and intra‐abdominal childhood tumours are available.&quot;</span>
- The review is an update of a previously published Cochrane review, indicating that an a priori design was provided. [Yes]

A2. Was there duplicate study selection and data extraction?
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎Two authors performed the study selection independently.&quot;</span>

A3. Was a comprehensive literature search performed?
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎We searched CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library 2014, Issue 1), MEDLINE/PubMed (from 1966 to February 2014) and EMBASE/Ovid (from 1980 to February 2014) to identify relevant studies.&quot;</span>
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎In addition, we searched reference lists of relevant articles and reviews and the conference proceedings of the International Society for Paediatric Oncology and the American Society of Clinical Oncology from 2003 to 2013.&quot;</span>
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎On 1 May 2014 we scanned the ISRCTN Register (on www.controlled‐trials.com), the National Institutes of Health register (on www.controlled‐trials.com and www.clinicaltrials.gov) and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (on www.apps.who.int/trialsearch) for ongoing trials.&quot;</span>

- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎If eligible studies had been identified, two authors would have independently assessed the risk of bias in these studies according to the criteria of the Cochrane Childhood Cancer Group.&quot;</span>
- Since no eligible studies were identified, the assessment of the scientific quality of the included studies was not applicable. [NA]

A8. Was the scientific quality of the included studies used appropriately in formulating conclusions?
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎Thus there is insufficient evidence to allow any definitive conclusions regarding overall survival, event‐free survival, port‐site metastases, recurrence rate and surgical morbidity associated with the use of MIS in these patients.&quot;</span>

Summary: The systematic review did not find any trials that met the inclusion criteria, therefore the methodological quality of the review cannot be fully assessed. However, the review did provide an a priori design, performed a comprehensive literature search, and appropriately used the lack of high-quality evidence in formulating conclusions.</pre>

Summary: The systematic review provided an 'a priori' design, conducted duplicate study selection and data extraction, performed a comprehensive literature search, provided a list of included studies, and described the characteristics of the included studies. However, there was no information provided on the assessment of the scientific quality of the included studies or the use of the scientific quality in formulating conclusions. The methods used to combine the findings of studies were appropriate, and the likelihood of publication bias was assessed. The conflict of interest was included.</pre>

<pre>
A1. Was an 'a priori' design provided?
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎We conducted a systematic review of literature focusing on the surgical treatment of IAT, including quality assessment of each study.&quot;</span> 
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎We used a Dephi-like method [16] to determine the issues of greatest concern to pediatric surgeons regarding the surgical management of cryptorchid testes.&quot;</span>
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎We sent an online survey to 34 experts with proficiency in this area, identified primarily on the basis of a literature search.&quot;</span>
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎We developed a questionnaire listing all the issues raised by the experts in the first round.&quot;</span>
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎We conducted electronic searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CINAHL from inception to September 2014.&quot;</span>
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎We used the following search terms: “Cryptorchidism” AND “Intra-abdominal” OR “Abdomen/abdominal cavity/inguinal canal/groin.”&quot;</span>
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎We included all studies that examined diagnostic and surgical correction techniques for IAT, even if this was not the primary focus of the study.&quot;</span>
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎Our outcomes of interest were success of orchiopexy (testis viable and located in the scrotum), testicular atrophy, and intra-operative and post-operative complications.&quot;</span>
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎Article screening took place in two stages—title and abstract, and full-text screening—both of which were conducted independently by two reviewers, followed by a consensus process.&quot;</span>
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎We used AMSTAR [18] to assess the quality of all relevant systematic reviews (SRs).&quot;</span>
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎Had we identified any randomized controlled trials (RCTs), we would have used the Cochrane ‘Risk of bias’ tool [19] to assess their quality.&quot;</span>
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎We used MINORS [20] to assess the quality of all relevant non-randomized studies (comparative or non-comparative).&quot;</span>
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎Two reviewers independently assessed each included study and compared the scores for each item on the applicable quality assessment tool to reach a consensus.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The authors clearly describe the methods used to conduct the systematic review, including the search strategy, study selection process, and quality assessment tools used. They also mention using a Delphi-like method to determine the research question and issues of concern to pediatric surgeons. Therefore, an 'a priori' design was provided.
Answer: [Yes]

A2. Was there duplicate study selection and data extraction?
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎Article screening took place in two stages—title and abstract, and full-text screening—both of which were conducted independently by two reviewers, followed by a consensus process.&quot;</span>
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎Two reviewers independently assessed each included study and compared the scores for each item on the applicable quality assessment tool to reach a consensus.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The study selection and data extraction processes were conducted independently by two reviewers, followed by a consensus process. Therefore, there was duplicate study selection and data extraction.
Answer: [Yes]

A3. Was a comprehensive literature search performed?
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎We conducted electronic searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CINAHL from inception to September 2014.&quot;</span>
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎We used the following search terms: “Cryptorchidism” AND “Intra-abdominal” OR “Abdomen/abdominal cavity/inguinal canal/groin.”&quot;</span>
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎We also hand-searched the reference sections of included articles for additional relevant studies.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The authors conducted a comprehensive literature search by searching multiple databases and hand-searching reference lists. They also provide details of the search terms used. Therefore, a comprehensive literature search was performed.
Answer: [Yes]

A4. Was the status of publication (i.e. grey literature) used as an inclusion criterion?
- No relevant quotes.

Reasoning: The text does not mention whether the status of publication was used as an inclusion criterion. Therefore, it is not clear if the authors searched for grey literature or unpublished literature.
Answer: [NA]

A5. Was a list of studies (included and excluded) provided?
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎We performed full-text screening for these articles, excluding 17 that did not meet our criteria [7, 10, 22–36]. The remaining 31 studies comprised two SRs and 29 non-randomized studies; we quality assessed and summarized these studies (Table 1).&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The authors mention that they performed full-text screening and excluded 17 studies that did not meet their criteria. They also provide a summary table of the included studies. However, they do not explicitly state whether a list of excluded studies was provided. Therefore, it is unclear if a list of excluded studies was provided.
Answer: [No]

A6. Were the characteristics of the included studies provided?
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎We quality assessed and summarized these studies (Table 1).&quot;</span>
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎Table 1 Summaries of included studies, including quality scores&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The authors mention that they summarized the included studies in Table 1, which likely includes information on the characteristics of the studies. However, the full text does not provide specific details about the characteristics of the included studies. Therefore, it is unclear if the characteristics of the included studies were provided.
Answer: [NA]

A7. Was the scientific quality of the included studies assessed and documented?
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎We used AMSTAR [18] to assess the quality of all relevant systematic reviews (SRs).&quot;</span>
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎Had we identified any randomized controlled trials (RCTs), we would have used the Cochrane ‘Risk of bias’ tool [19] to assess their quality.&quot;</span>
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎We used MINORS [20] to assess the quality of all relevant non-randomized studies (comparative or non-comparative).&quot;</span>
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎Two reviewers independently assessed each included study and compared the scores for each item on the applicable quality assessment tool to reach a consensus.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The authors clearly state that they used quality assessment tools (AMSTAR, Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool, and MINORS) to assess the scientific quality of the included studies. They also mention that two reviewers independently assessed each included study and reached a consensus on the quality assessment. Therefore, the scientific quality of the included studies was assessed and documented.
Answer: [Yes]

A8. Was the scientific quality of the included studies used appropriately in formulating conclusions?
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎The results of our systematic review should, therefore, be interpreted with caution.&quot;</span>
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎Therefore, we recommend that the surgeon’s preference and comfort level should dictate whether a one- or two-stage and open or laparoscopic procedure is undertaken until additional evidence becomes available.&quot;</span>
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎Further studies—particularly RCTs—are needed to confirm the validity of these recommendations, and to improve the current surgical techniques for optimization of long-term outcomes.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The authors acknowledge the limitations of the included studies and recommend caution in interpreting the results. They also mention the need for further studies, particularly RCTs, to confirm the validity of their recommendations. Therefore, the scientific quality of the included studies was appropriately used in formulating conclusions.
Answer: [Yes]

A9. Were the methods used to combine the findings of studies appropriate?
- No relevant quotes.

Reasoning: The text does not mention any methods used to combine the findings of studies. Additionally, since the authors state that meta-analysis was not possible due to heterogeneity of the data, it is unlikely that they used any methods to combine the findings. Therefore, it is not clear if the methods used to combine the findings of studies were appropriate.
Answer: [NA]

A10. Was the likelihood of publication bias assessed?
- No relevant quotes.

Reasoning: The text does not mention any assessment of publication bias. Additionally, since the authors state that they did not identify any RCTs published in the past 6 years, it is unlikely that they assessed publication bias. Therefore, it is not clear if the likelihood of publication bias was assessed.
Answer: [NA]

A11. Was the conflict of interest included?
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎The authors declare that they have no conflict of interest.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The authors explicitly state that they have no conflict of interest. Therefore, the conflict of interest was included.

<pre>
A1. Was an 'a priori' design provided?
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎For this meta-analysis, the Medline (1990–2009), Embase (1990–2009) and Cochrane databases were searched using the keyword ‘hypospadias’. Inclusion criteria were: i) primary repairs; ii) distal hypospadias; iii) paediatric case series; iv) standard Mathieu and TIP techniques; v) complication data obtainable from the paper.&quot;</span> 
- The study clearly states the inclusion criteria that were established before conducting the review. [Yes]

A2. Was there duplicate study selection and data extraction?
- No information is provided about duplicate study selection and data extraction. 
- It is unclear whether there were two independent data extractors and a consensus procedure for disagreements. [No]

A3. Was a comprehensive literature search performed?
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎The Medline (1990–Dec 2009), Embase (1990–Dec 2009) and Cochrane databases were searched using the single search term ‘hypospadias’ to ensure the broadest capture of relevant papers.&quot;</span>
- The study used multiple electronic sources (Medline, Embase, Cochrane) to perform the literature search. [Yes]

A4. Was the status of publication (i.e. grey literature) used as an inclusion criterion?
- No information is provided about the status of publication being used as an inclusion criterion.
- It is unclear whether the authors searched for grey literature or unpublished literature. [No]

A5. Was a list of studies (included and excluded) provided?
- No information is provided about a list of studies (included and excluded).
- It is unclear whether a list of studies was provided. [No]

A6. Were the characteristics of the included studies provided?
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎We identified an increased incidence of urethral fistulae with the Mathieu technique (3.8% vs 5.3%, P = 0.028); however, this is lost on subgroup analysis. An increased incidence of meatal stenosis was identified in the TIP group (3.1% vs 0.7%, P < 0.001).&quot;</span>

Overall, the methodological quality of the systematic review is adequate. The review had a clear research question and objective, conducted a comprehensive literature search, assessed the scientific quality of the included studies, appropriately used the scientific quality in formulating conclusions, and assessed the likelihood of publication bias. However, there were some limitations, such as the lack of inclusion/exclusion criteria for grey literature and the absence of a list of included and excluded studies.</pre>

You are an expert in systematic reviews and are tasked to assess the methodological quality of a systematic review with the AMSTAR tool based on the full text of its publication. AMSTAR consists of the following items:

---
# AMSTAR
A1. Was an 'a priori' design provided? The research question and inclusion criteria should be established before the conduct of the review. Note: Need to refer to a protocol, ethics approval, or pre-determined/a priori published research objectives to score a “yes.”
A2. Was there duplicate study selection and data extraction? There should be at least two independent data extractors and a consensus procedure for disagreements should be in place. Note: 2 people do study selection, 2 people do data extraction, consensus process or one person checks the other’s work.
A3. Was a comprehensive literature search performed? At least two electronic sources should be searched. The report must include years and databases used (e.g., Central, EMBASE, and MEDLINE). Key words and/or MESH terms must be stated and where feasible the search strategy should be provided. All searches should be supplemented by consulting current contents, reviews, textbooks, specialized registers, or experts in the particular field of study, and by reviewing the references in the studies found. Note: If at least 2 sources + one supplementary strategy used, select “yes” (Cochrane register/Central counts as 2 sources; a grey literature search counts as supplementary).
A4. Was the status of publication (i.e. grey literature) used as an inclusion criterion? The authors should state that they searched for reports regardless of their publication type. The authors should state whether or not they excluded any reports (from the systematic review), based on their publication status, language etc. Note: If review indicates that there was a search for “grey literature” or “unpublished literature,” indicate “yes.” SIGLE database, dissertations, conference proceedings, and trial registries are all considered grey for this purpose. If searching a source that contains both grey and non-grey, must specify that they were searching for grey/unpublished lit.
A5. Was a list of studies (included and excluded) provided? A list of included and excluded studies should be provided. Note: Acceptable if the excluded studies are referenced. If there is an electronic link to the list but the link is dead, select “no.”
A6. Were the characteristics of the included studies provided? In an aggregated form such as a table, data from the original studies should be provided on the participants, interventions and outcomes. The ranges of characteristics in all the studies analyzed e.g., age, race, sex, relevant socioeconomic data, disease status, duration, severity, or other diseases should be reported. Note: Acceptable if not in table format as long as they are described as above. Paul "Follow-up poorly reported in general"
A7. Was the scientific quality of the included studies assessed and documented? 'A priori' methods of assessment should be provided (e.g., for effectiveness studies if the author(s) chose to include only randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled studies, or allocation concealment as inclusion criteria); for other types of studies alternative items will be relevant. Note: Can include use of a quality scoring tool or checklist, e.g., Jadad scale, risk of bias, sensitivity analysis, etc., or a description of quality items, with some kind of result for EACH study (“low” or “high” is fine, as long as it is clear which studies scored “low” and which scored “high”; a summary score/range for all studies is not acceptable).
A8. Was the scientific quality of the included studies used appropriately in formulating conclusions? The results of the methodological rigor and scientific quality should be considered in the analysis and the conclusions of the review, and explicitly stated in formulating recommendations. Note: Might say something such as “the results should be interpreted with caution due to poor quality of included studies.” Cannot score “yes” for this question if scored “no” for question A7.
A9. Were the methods used to combine the findings of studies appropriate? For the pooled results, a test should be done to ensure the studies were combinable, to assess their homogeneity (i.e., Chi-squared test for homogeneity, I2 ). If heterogeneity exists a random effects model should be used and/or the clinical appropriateness of combining should be taken into consideration (i.e., is it sensible to combine?). Note: Indicate “yes” if they mention or describe heterogeneity, i.e., if they explain that they cannot pool because of heterogeneity/variability between interventions.
A10. Was the likelihood of publication bias assessed? An assessment of publication bias should include a combination of graphical aids (e.g., funnel plot, other available tests) and/or statistical tests (e.g., Egger regression test, Hedges-Olken). Note: If no test values or funnel plot included, score “no”. Score “yes” if mentions that publication bias could not be assessed because there were fewer than 10 included studies.
A11. Was the conflict of interest included? Potential sources of support should be clearly acknowledged in both the systematic review and the included studies. Note: To get a “yes,” must indicate source of funding or support for the systematic review AND for each of the included studies.

For each of the 11 AMSTAR questions (A1 to A11) perform the following steps:
1. Extract 1-3 relevant quotes from the full text.
2. Explain your reasoning in 1 sentence.
3. Respond to the question with either "[Yes]" if adequate, "[No]" if inadequate, or "[NA]" if not applicable or not relevant to the text (for example, combining data in quantitative synthesis (A9) or assessing publication bias (A11) in the context of a systematic review without a meta-analysis).

Before stopping, make sure you've processed all 11 AMSTAR questions. Do not provide a final summary paragraph in the end.
