1. Eligibility:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Pregnant women were eligible if they were to undergo delivery by lower segment caesarean section through a transverse abdominal incision, irrespective of fever in labour, gestational age, or multiple pregnancies. Women were not eligible if there was a clear indication for a particular surgical technique or material to be used that prevented any of the allocated interventions being used, if they had more than one previous caesarean section, or if they had already been recruited into the trial.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial included pregnant women who were to undergo a lower segment caesarean section through a transverse abdominal incision, regardless of fever in labor, gestational age, or multiple pregnancies. However, women were excluded if there was a clear indication for a particular surgical technique or material to be used that prevented any of the allocated interventions being used, if they had more than one previous caesarean section, or if they had already been recruited into the trial. This suggests that the trial had some exclusion criteria, but still aimed to include a broad range of participants who would typically undergo a caesarean section.

Score: [4]

1. Recruitment:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Each participating site, advised by their research ethics committee, decided how to provide trial information to women and seek informed consent. Information leaflets were made available, in appropriate languages, which explained the trial objectives, the process of trial entry, and follow-up.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial used information leaflets in appropriate languages to explain the trial objectives, the process of trial entry, and follow-up. Each participating site, advised by their research ethics committee, decided how to provide trial information to women and seek informed consent. This suggests that the trial used a pragmatic approach to recruitment, relying on standard clinical practices and procedures to inform and recruit participants.

Score: [5]

1. Setting:
Quote: <span title='Moderate quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 90.9%):

was undertaken at 19 sites in Argentina, Chile, Ghana, India, Kenya, Pakistan, and Sudan.' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ff9e81'>&quot;The trial was undertaken at 19 sites in Argentina, Chile, Ghana, India, Kenya, Pakistan, and Sudan.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial was conducted at 19 sites across seven countries, which suggests that it aimed to reflect the diversity of settings in which caesarean sections are performed. This indicates a pragmatic approach to the trial setting.

Score: [5]

1. Organization:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Each regional coordinator (one per country, except India, which was split into two regions) started and documented a training programme that ensured that surgeons operating within the trial were familiar with the techniques being compared before participating. To facilitate this, the international coordinating centre gave a DVD of the interventions tested to all study sites.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial ensured that surgeons operating within the trial were familiar with the techniques being compared before participating by providing a training program and a DVD of the interventions tested. This suggests that the trial aimed to ensure that the organization of care delivery was similar to usual care, while also ensuring that the trial interventions were delivered as intended.

Score: [4]

1. Flexibility (delivery):
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;All non-allocated surgical elements and all other aspects of the caesarean section procedure were undertaken at the discretion of the surgeon. In particular, there were no restrictions on the type of suture material that could be used, and standard measures to achieve haemostasis were employed regardless of the allocated intervention.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial allowed for flexibility in the delivery of the intervention, as all non-allocated surgical elements and all other aspects of the caesarean section procedure were undertaken at the discretion of the surgeon. This suggests that the trial aimed to reflect the flexibility that is typically present in clinical practice.

Score: [5]

1. Flexibility (adherence):
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;All investigators, surgeons, and participants were unmasked to treatment allocation.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial did not use blinding or masking, which suggests that it aimed to reflect the flexibility that is typically present in clinical practice with regard to adherence to the intervention.

Score: [5]

1. Follow-up:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Data were collected at trial entry, immediately after surgery, at hospital discharge (including hospital transfer or death), and at about 6 weeks after delivery. Women who did not return at 6 weeks were located and interviewed by telephone or during a home visit.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial collected data at multiple time points, including trial entry, immediately after surgery, at hospital discharge, and at about 6 weeks after delivery. Women who did not return at 6 weeks were located and interviewed by telephone or during a home visit. This suggests that the trial aimed to reflect the typical follow-up practices that are used in clinical practice.

Score: [5]

1. Primary outcome:
Quote: <span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 98.6%):

The primary outcome was a composite of death, maternal infectious morbidity, further operative procedures, or blood transfusion of more than 1 unit of whole blood or packed cells up to the 6-week follow-up visit.' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;The primary outcome was the composite of death, maternal infectious morbidity, further operative procedures, or blood transfusion of more than 1 unit of whole blood or packed cells up to the 6-week follow-up visit.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The primary outcome was a composite of death, maternal infectious morbidity, further operative procedures, or blood transfusion of more than 1 unit of whole blood or packed cells up to the 6-week follow-up visit. This outcome is of obvious importance to participants and reflects the typical outcomes that are used in clinical practice.

Score: [5]

1. Primary analysis:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Women were analysed in the groups into which they were allocated; for example, comparing women allocated to blunt abdominal entry with those allocated to sharp abdominal entry, regardless of what interventions they actually received.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial used an intention-to-treat analysis, which means that women were analyzed in the groups into which they were allocated, regardless of what interventions they actually received. This approach is consistent with the pragmatic approach of the trial and reflects the typical analysis methods that are used in clinical practice.

<p><i><span style="border-bottom: 1px dashed black;">8 quote(s) from
publication full text</span> (mean similarity 100%)</i></p>
<pre>
1. Eligibility:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Patients with type 2 diabetes (n=264) selected by a self-administered questionnaire aimed at measuring emotional distress and diabetes-related reduced daily functioning.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial included patients with type 2 diabetes who were selected based on emotional distress and reduced daily functioning, which are common issues in usual care. This suggests that the trial participants are similar to those who would receive the intervention in usual care.

Score: [4]

1. Recruitment:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Patients were asked to return the completed questionnaire to the research centre and to give informed consent to be approached if they were found to be eligible for research follow-up measurements.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The recruitment process involved patients returning a completed questionnaire and providing informed consent, which is similar to usual care. However, the use of a research center for follow-up measurements may not be typical in usual care.

Score: [3]

1. Setting:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The study involved practice nurses (n=40) providing care to approximately 4000 patients with diabetes.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial was conducted in a primary care setting, which is where the intervention would be delivered in usual care.

Score: [5]

1. Organization:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Practice nurses in the intervention arm (n=19) were trained to integrate SMS into their routine consultations.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial involved training practice nurses to deliver the intervention, which is similar to usual care. However, the use of a specific training program may not be typical in usual care.

Score: [4]

1. Flexibility (delivery):
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Practice nurses in the control arm (n=21) provided usual care.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial allowed for flexibility in the delivery of the intervention, as practice nurses in the control arm provided usual care.

Score: [5]

1. Flexibility (adherence):
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Multilevel analyses showed no significant differences in outcomes between the intervention and control arms.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial did not report any measures to improve adherence to the intervention, which suggests that there was flexibility in adherence.

Score: [5]

1. Follow-up:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Outcomes were measured at baseline and at 4-month and 12-month follow-ups.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial involved follow-up measurements at 4 and 12 months, which is similar to usual care.

Score: [4]

1. Primary outcome:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The primary outcome measure was a dichotomised score on a Visual Analogue Scale that measured the perceived effect of diabetes on daily functioning.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The primary outcome measure was relevant to participants, as it assessed the perceived effect of diabetes on daily functioning, which is an important issue for people with diabetes.

Score: [5]

1. Primary analysis:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Multilevel analyses showed no significant differences in outcomes between the intervention and control arms.&quot;</span>

<pre>
1. Eligibility:
* <span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 99.6%):

Eligible primary care patients 12 to 80 years of age had impaired asthmarelated quality of life (Mini Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire [MiniAQLQ] score ≤6) or inadequate asthma control (Asthma Control Questionnaire [ACQ] score ≥1).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;Eligible primary care patients 12 to 80 years of age had impaired asthma-related quality of life (Mini Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire [MiniAQLQ] score ≤6) or inadequate asthma control (Asthma Control Questionnaire [ACQ] score ≥1).&quot;</span>
* <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Main exclusion criteria were prior treatment within 12 weeks with an inhaled glucocorticoid or LTRA (in the first-line controller therapy trial) or LTRA or LABA (in the add-on therapy trial).&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The eligibility criteria for this trial are relatively broad, including patients with impaired asthma-related quality of life or inadequate asthma control. However, the exclusion of patients who had recently received certain treatments may limit the generalizability of the results to a broader population.

Score: [3]

1. Recruitment:
* <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;We randomly assigned patients to 2 years of open-label therapy, under the care of their usual physician, with LTRA (148 patients) or an inhaled glucocorticoid (158 patients) in the first-line controller therapy trial and LTRA (170 patients) or LABA (182 patients) added to an inhaled glucocorticoid in the add-on therapy trial.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The recruitment process involved assigning patients to treatment groups under the care of their usual physician, which suggests a pragmatic approach to recruitment. However, the lack of information on the specific recruitment methods used makes it difficult to fully assess this domain.

Score: [4]

1. Setting:
* <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The two trials, which were conducted at 53 primary care practices in the United Kingdom, enrolled patients 12 to 80 years of age with a physician’s diagnosis of asthma.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial was conducted in a primary care setting, which is likely to be similar to the usual care setting for patients with asthma. This suggests a pragmatic approach to the setting of the trial.

Score: [5]

1. Organization:
* <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Practice staffs were asked to provide each patient with a written individualized asthma-action plan.&quot;</span>
* <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;For each of the assigned treatments, choices of individual drugs and devices were made according to normal clinical practice and British asthma guidelines.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial appears to have been organized in a way that reflects usual care, with practice staff providing individualized asthma-action plans and treatment choices made according to clinical practice guidelines. However, the lack of information on the resources and provider expertise available in the trial makes it difficult to fully assess this domain.

Score: [4]

1. Flexibility (delivery):
* <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The protocol discouraged substantial treatment changes between randomization and the 2-month visit.&quot;</span>
* <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;If a patient required a disallowed asthma medication, this fact was noted, and the patient remained in the study.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial protocol allowed for some flexibility in the delivery of the intervention, with patients remaining in the study even if they required a disallowed medication. However, the discouragement of substantial treatment changes suggests a more explanatory approach.

Score: [2]

1. Flexibility (adherence):
* <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Patients who withdrew from the study continued to receive care from their usual clinician.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial allowed patients to withdraw and continue receiving care from their usual clinician, which suggests a pragmatic approach to adherence. However, the lack of information on measures to improve adherence makes it difficult to fully assess this domain.

Score: [4]

1. Follow-up:
* <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Clinical and lung-function data were recorded by clinic staff who were aware of the treatment assignments.&quot;</span>
* <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Data collection and statistical analyses were performed by study personnel who were unaware of the treatment assignments; questionnaire-based data were collected under blinded conditions, and routine practice data (including a history of exacerbations) were extracted with the use of dedicated software.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial involved regular follow-up assessments by clinic staff who were aware of the treatment assignments, which suggests a more explanatory approach. However, the use of dedicated software to extract routine practice data suggests a pragmatic approach to follow-up.

Score: [3]

1. Primary outcome:
* <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The primary outcome measure was the MiniAQLQ score.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The primary outcome measure of the trial was the MiniAQLQ score, which is a patient-reported outcome that is likely to be of importance to participants. This suggests a pragmatic approach to the choice of primary outcome.

Score: [5]

1. Primary analysis:
* <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The primary effectiveness analysis was an intention-to-treat analysis of the MiniAQLQ score at 2 months (the primary time point) and at 2 years.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The primary analysis of the trial was an intention-to-treat analysis, which is a pragmatic approach that includes all available data.

<p><i><span style="border-bottom: 1px dashed black;">9 quote(s) from
publication full text</span> (mean similarity 99.9%)</i></p>
<pre>
1. Eligibility:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Patient selection criteria were having a diagnosis of moderate-to-severe COPD (a Body mass index, Airflow obstruction, dyspnoea and Exercise capacity [BODE] index score of 3–7) according to international guidelines&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial includes patients with moderate-to-severe COPD, which is a broad and representative population of patients with this condition. This aligns with the pragmatic approach of PRECIS-2.

Score: [5]

2. Recruitment:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Recruited patients (recruitment visit, −1) attended an initial 8-week outpatient-based PR programme conducted in each hospital rehabilitation department.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The recruitment process involves patients attending an outpatient-based PR program, which is a usual care setting. This suggests a pragmatic approach to recruitment.

Score: [5]

3. Setting:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The hospital-based outpatient programme consisted of three training sessions a week which included 30 min of weight lifting and 30 min of leg cycle ergometry along with four educational sessions which included chest physiotherapy training.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial is conducted in a hospital-based outpatient setting, which is a usual care setting for patients with COPD. This aligns with the pragmatic approach of PRECIS-2.

Score: [5]

4. Organization:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Patients in the IG were asked to continue at home with a similar training schedule to that completed in the hospital. They were provided with, for the 12-month follow-up period, a telerehabilitation kit (mobile phone, pulse oximeter, dumbbells and exercise bicycle) along with a user guide with detailed instructions on the use of the mobile device to deliver data collected to the web-based platform after completion of each scheduled session.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial uses resources and provider expertise that are available in usual care, such as a telerehabilitation kit and a web-based platform. This suggests a pragmatic approach to organization.

Score: [5]

5. Flexibility (delivery):
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Patients in the CG received usual care, that is, they were advised to exercise regularly (at least walking for 1 hour a day) and provided with general educational material, following current clinical practice at participating sites.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial allows for flexibility in the delivery of the intervention, as patients in the control group are advised to exercise regularly and provided with general educational material. This aligns with the pragmatic approach of PRECIS-2.

Score: [5]

6. Flexibility (adherence):
Quote: <span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 99.5%):

patient in the IG arm was classified as a non-complier if he/she did not perform scheduled exercises for at least 8 consecutive weeks, unless there were clear clinical reasons not to.' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;A patient in the IG arm was classified as a non-complier if he/she did not perform scheduled exercises for at least 8 consecutive weeks, unless there were clear clinical reasons not to.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial allows for flexibility in adherence to the intervention, as patients in the intervention group are classified as non-compliers only if they do not perform scheduled exercises for at least 8 consecutive weeks, unless there are clear clinical reasons not to. This aligns with the pragmatic approach of PRECIS-2.

Score: [5]

7. Follow-up:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;After the randomization visit, follow-up appointments were arranged for both groups at 3, 9 and 12 months. At each follow-up visit, the general health status of the patient was assessed, medical treatment was revised and optimized, educational reinforcement was provided, 6-minute walk test (6MWT) and spirometry tests were carried out and HRQoL measures were taken.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial includes follow-up appointments at 3, 9, and 12 months, which is a usual care setting for patients with COPD. This suggests a pragmatic approach to follow-up.

Score: [5]

8. Primary outcome:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Exercise tolerance (the ability to sustain exercise) was assessed using distance covered in the 6MWT.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The primary outcome of the trial is exercise tolerance, which is of obvious importance to patients with COPD. This aligns with the pragmatic approach of PRECIS-2.

Score: [5]

9. Primary analysis:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The main efficacy analysis used analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) techniques to test for differences between groups in outcome variables at the 12-month visit, adjusted for baseline values.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial uses an intention-to-treat analysis, which includes all available data and adjusts for baseline values. This aligns with the pragmatic approach of PRECIS-2.

<p><i><span style="border-bottom: 1px dashed black;">18 quote(s) from
publication full text</span> (mean similarity 99.5%)</i></p>
<pre>
1. Eligibility:
- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Eighty people with Expanded Disability Status scores of 1 to 6.5 participated in this trial.&quot;</span>
- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The inclusion criteria were as follows: (1) diagnosed with MS in accordance with the McDonald criteria; (2) registered at the MS outpatient clinic; (3) living in 1 of 6 selected municipalities; (4) aged 18 years or older; (5) capable of providing signed written informed consent; and (6) EDSS score between 1 and 6.5 (1 = minor disability, 6.5 = able to walk 20 m with or without a walking aid).&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The trial included participants with a wide range of disability scores (1-6.5) and did not exclude participants based on their ability to comply with treatment or respond to it. The inclusion criteria were broad and similar to those used in usual care settings.
- Score: [5]

2. Recruitment:
- Quote: <span title='Moderate quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 90.6%):

Ninety-three persons returned signed written informed consent. Among the 67 persons who did not respond, 57% had EDSS scores of 0 to 3.5, 21% had EDSS scores of 4 to 7, and 22% had an 1' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ff9e81'>&quot;Ninety-three persons returned signed written informed consent. Among the 67 persons who did not respond, 57% had EDSS scores of 0 to 3.5, 21% had EDSS scores of 4 to 7, and 22% had an unknown EDSS score.&quot;</span>
- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Enrollment started in September 2015, and follow-up was completed in September 2016.&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The trial recruited participants through usual appointments or clinic visits, and there was no mention of targeted invitation letters, advertising, or incentives to recruit participants. The recruitment period was not specified, but it appears to have been conducted over a reasonable time frame.
- Score: [5]

3. Setting:
- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The GroupCoreDIST intervention was conducted by 6 physical therapists in 6 municipalities in Norway.&quot;</span>
- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Assessments at all time points took place at a Norwegian hospital.&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The trial was conducted in multiple municipalities, which suggests that it was representative of the usual care setting. However, the assessments were conducted at a hospital, which may not be typical for usual care.
- Score: [4]

4. Organization:
- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Six neurological physical therapists conducted the intervention after being trained in GroupCoreDIST for 5 days.&quot;</span>
- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The physical therapists received a booklet with descriptions and photos of all exercises and variations, as well as the theoretical framework for the intervention.&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The trial used physical therapists with varying levels of experience and certification, which is similar to the usual care setting. The therapists received training and a booklet to guide the intervention, but there was no mention of additional resources or staff levels.
- Score: [5]

5. Flexibility (delivery):
- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The physical therapists individualized the exercises by tailoring them according to each individual’s symptoms, disability level, and general well-being, and they intensified the exercises by increasing number of repetitions, level of difficulty, and/or by adding motor-cognitive dual tasks as movement quality improved.&quot;</span>
- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The exercises were performed barefoot in various postural sets, always keeping a focus on dynamic core stability, alignment throughout the body, and optimal movement performance.&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The trial allowed for flexibility in the delivery of the intervention by individualizing the exercises and adjusting the intensity based on each participant’s needs. However, there was a strict protocol for the exercises and a focus on optimal movement performance.
- Score: [3]

6. Flexibility (adherence):
- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants in the intervention group were encouraged not to seek any physical therapy other than GroupCoreDIST during the 6 weeks of the intervention.&quot;</span>
- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The control group continued their regular routine and were encouraged to maintain their current level of physical activity and to seek any health care required, including physical therapy.&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The trial did not exclude participants based on adherence or use measures to improve adherence. However, participants in the intervention group were encouraged not to seek other physical therapy during the trial.
- Score: [4]

7. Follow-up:
- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Assessments were undertaken at baseline and at weeks 7, 18, and 30.&quot;</span>
- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Two assessors masked with regard to the group allocation carried out the assessments.&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The trial had a follow-up period of 30 weeks, which is longer than usual care. The assessments were conducted by masked assessors, which may not be typical for usual care.
- Score: [2]

8. Primary outcome:
- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Outcomes were measured with the Trunk Impairment Scale–Norwegian Version, Mini Balance Evaluation Systems Test, and Patient Global Impression of Change–Balance.&quot;</span>
- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The TIS-NV measures dynamic sitting balance and trunk control and includes 6 test items scored from 0 to 2 or 3, with a total score from 0 to 16 (0 = severe problem).&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The trial used relevant and important outcomes for participants, such as trunk impairment and balance. The outcomes were measured using validated scales.
- Score: [5]

9. Primary analysis:
- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Repeated-measures mixed models were used for statistical analysis.&quot;</span>
- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;One individual missed all postintervention tests, leaving 79 participants in the intention-to-treat analysis.&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The trial used an intention-to-treat analysis, which is a pragmatic approach to analyzing data. However, there was no mention of including all available data in the analysis.
- Score: [4]</pre>

<p><i><span style="border-bottom: 1px dashed black;">9 quote(s) from
publication full text</span> (mean similarity 100%)</i></p>
<pre>
1. Eligibility:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Inclusion criteria were diagnosis of PPMS or SPMS, Internet access and some level of distress determined by a score of 3 or greater on the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12).&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial includes participants with a diagnosis of PPMS or SPMS, which is a specific subgroup of MS patients. However, the inclusion criteria also require Internet access and a certain level of distress, which are not typically required for usual care. This suggests a more explanatory approach.

Score: [2]

1. Recruitment:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;We recruited potential participants through adverts on the MS Society website and from National Health Service (NHS) MS centres across the UK.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The recruitment strategy involves targeted advertisements and recruitment from specific NHS centers, which is not typical of usual care. This suggests a more explanatory approach.

Score: [2]

1. Setting:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;We delivered the programme in eight hour-long sessions over an eight-week period via Skype video conferences.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial uses Skype video conferences for delivering the intervention, which is not a typical setting for usual care. This suggests a more explanatory approach.

Score: [2]

1. Organization:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;AB, a health psychologist, facilitated the courses. AB was supervised by PC, a clinical psychologist and expert mindfulness practitioner.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial involves a specific team of health psychologists and clinical psychologists to deliver the intervention, which is not typical of usual care. This suggests a more explanatory approach.

Score: [2]

1. Flexibility (delivery):
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The format and manual for the mindfulness group, including length of sessions and individual mindfulness practices, were developed in partnership with patients with MS through initial experimental case studies.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial allows for some flexibility in the delivery of the intervention by involving patients in the development of the format and manual. However, the intervention is still delivered in a structured manner, which suggests a more explanatory approach.

Score: [3]

1. Flexibility (adherence):
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants were encouraged to keep a diary of home practice, but, in fact, very few did record it.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial encourages participants to adhere to the intervention, but there is no strict monitoring or measures to improve compliance. This suggests a more pragmatic approach.

Score: [4]

1. Follow-up:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants completed online questionnaires at baseline (prior to randomisation), post-intervention and three-month follow-up.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial involves a more intensive follow-up than usual care, with participants completing online questionnaires at multiple time points. This suggests a more explanatory approach.

Score: [2]

1. Primary outcome:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The GHQ is designed to measure general levels of distress. The GHQ is uncontaminated by the experience of MS-related somatic symptoms and is the most treatment-responsive measure of psychological distress in MS.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial uses a specific measure of distress as the primary outcome, which is relevant to participants but may not be the most common outcome in usual care. This suggests a more explanatory approach.

Score: [3]

1. Primary analysis:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;We conducted all group comparisons on an intention-to-treat basis where we analysed participants in the group to which they were randomised.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial uses an intention-to-treat analysis, which is a more pragmatic approach as it includes all available data.

<p><i><span style="border-bottom: 1px dashed black;">9 quote(s) from
publication full text</span> (mean similarity 99.3%)</i></p>
<pre>
1. Eligibility:
* Relevant quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The inclusion criteria were as follows: age > 18, confirmed diagnosis of MS, Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS): 2.0–6.5, Six Spot Step Test (SSST) score > 8 seconds or Timed 25-Foot Walk (T25FW) > 5 seconds, relapse-free within the past 8 weeks, and no adjustment of disease-modifying medication or medication that affects gait performance and spasticity within the past 8 weeks.&quot;</span>
* Reasoning: The inclusion criteria are relatively broad and include a range of EDSS scores, which suggests that the trial is aiming to recruit participants who are representative of the usual care population. However, the exclusion of participants with certain comorbidities or who have recently adjusted their medication may limit the generalizability of the results to the broader population.
* Score: [4]
1. Recruitment:
* Relevant quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants were included from September 2016 to October 2018, after being invited via seven MS clinics (specified in “Acknowledgements” section) and targeted advertisements sent out via the Danish MS Society.&quot;</span>
* Reasoning: The recruitment strategy appears to be a mix of usual care (invitations via MS clinics) and more targeted efforts (advertisements via the Danish MS Society). This suggests that the trial is making some extra effort to recruit participants, but not to the extent that it would be considered very explanatory.
* Score: [3]
1. Setting:
* Relevant quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The interventions lasted 10 weeks. A total of 71 participants with impaired mobility (Timed 25-Foot Walk (T25FW) > 5 seconds or Six Spot Step Test (SSST) > 8 seconds) were enrolled.&quot;</span>
* Reasoning: The trial is conducted in a clinical setting, but the specific details of the setting are not provided. However, the fact that the trial is focused on participants with impaired mobility suggests that it is likely to be conducted in a setting that is similar to usual care.
* Score: [4]
1. Organization:
* Relevant quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;All training sessions were supervised by physiotherapists who were trained to deliver the intervention.&quot;</span>
* Reasoning: The trial is organized in a way that is similar to usual care, with trained physiotherapists delivering the intervention. However, the fact that the trial is focused on a specific intervention (progressive resistance training or balance and motor control training) suggests that there may be some additional resources or expertise required compared to usual care.
* Score: [3]
1. Flexibility (delivery):
* Relevant quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The exercises were conducted in machines that targeted the specified muscle groups, but type of machines could vary between centers.&quot;</span>
* Reasoning: The trial allows for some flexibility in the delivery of the intervention, as the type of machines used can vary between centers. However, the fact that the exercises are conducted in machines suggests that there may be less flexibility compared to usual care.
* Score: [2]
1. Flexibility (adherence):
* Relevant quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Exercise intensity was derived from the rate of failure, as this was interpreted as an indication of how challenging a given task was perceived.&quot;</span>
* Reasoning: The trial allows for some flexibility in adherence, as exercise intensity is based on the rate of failure rather than strict protocols. However, the fact that adherence is monitored and encouraged suggests that there may be less flexibility compared to usual care.
* Score: [2]
1. Follow-up:
* Relevant quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The follow-up test was performed within 7 days of the last intervention session or after the last day of being on the waitlist.&quot;</span>
* Reasoning: The trial includes a follow-up assessment, which is similar to usual care. However, the fact that the follow-up test is performed within 7 days of the last intervention session suggests that there may be more frequent follow-up compared to usual care.
* Score: [3]
1. Primary outcome:
* Relevant quote: <span title='Moderate quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 93.9%):

Primary outcomes were the T25FW and the SSST.' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ff9e81'>&quot;The primary outcomes were the T25FW and the SSST.&quot;</span>
* Reasoning: The primary outcomes are relevant to participants, as they are measures of mobility and functional capacity. However, the fact that the trial is focused on a specific intervention (progressive resistance training or balance and motor control training) suggests that the outcomes may be more relevant to the intervention than to usual care.
* Score: [3]
1. Primary analysis:
* Relevant quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Analyses were carried out as intention-to-treat, where all participants who completed the baseline assessment were included regardless of their adherence to the allocated intervention.&quot;</span>
* Reasoning: The trial includes all participants in the primary analysis, regardless of adherence to the intervention. This is consistent with usual care and suggests that the trial is pragmatic in its approach to data analysis.
* Score: [5]</pre>

<pre>
1. Eligibility:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The inclusion criteria for the trial were clinical diagnosis of MS, as defined by the modified McDonald criteria, with an Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score of 1.0–6.5, and able to walk a 10-metre distance; aged 18–65 years; clinically stable for at least four weeks prior to entering the study; physically able to participate in exercise three times per week; able to provide written informed consent.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial included participants with a clinical diagnosis of MS, with an EDSS score ranging from 1.0 to 6.5, and the ability to walk a 10-metre distance. The age range was 18-65 years, and participants had to be clinically stable for at least four weeks prior to entering the study. These criteria are relatively broad and inclusive, allowing for a diverse range of participants who would typically receive the intervention in usual care.

Score: [4]

1. Recruitment:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;A total of 120 PwMS were recruited via the Sheffield MS Clinic and flyers/community adverts displayed at the local South Yorkshire MS Society branches.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial recruited participants through the Sheffield MS Clinic and community adverts displayed at local MS Society branches. This method of recruitment is similar to how patients would typically engage with healthcare providers in usual care settings.

Score: [4]

1. Setting:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;During weeks 1–6, participants attended two supervised sessions per week at a university exercise research facility and engaged in one additional self-directed exercise session in their home environment.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial included both supervised sessions at a university exercise research facility and self-directed exercise sessions in participants' home environments. This mix of settings reflects the variety of locations where patients might receive care in usual care settings.

Score: [4]

1. Organization:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;An exercise physiologist supervised the delivery of the intervention but with physiotherapist input during the early stages of the programme.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial involved an exercise physiologist supervising the intervention, with input from a physiotherapist during the early stages. This level of staffing and expertise is likely to be similar to what would be available in usual care settings.

Score: [4]

1. Flexibility (delivery):
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The programme was designed to be pragmatic and accessible, taking into account exercise preferences and giving choices.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial's exercise program was designed to be pragmatic and accessible, taking into account participants' exercise preferences and providing choices. This flexibility in delivery is likely to be similar to what would be available in usual care settings.

Score: [4]

1. Flexibility (adherence):
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants were encouraged to seek out opportunities to exercise in the local community (e.g. healthy living centres, health walks, fitness centres, swimming pools, etc.), based on their individual preferences.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial encouraged participants to seek out opportunities to exercise in their local communities based on their individual preferences. This flexibility in adherence is likely to be similar to what would be available in usual care settings.

Score: [4]

1. Follow-up:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Outcomes were blindly assessed at baseline and at three and nine months after randomisation.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial assessed outcomes at baseline and at three and nine months after randomisation. This frequency of follow-up is likely to be similar to what would be available in usual care settings.

Score: [4]

1. Primary outcome:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The primary outcome was self-reported exercise behaviour (Godin Leisure Time Exercise Questionnaire (GLTEQ)).&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The primary outcome of the trial was self-reported exercise behavior, which is of obvious importance to participants. This outcome is relevant to participants and is likely to be similar to what would be measured in usual care settings.

Score: [5]

1. Primary analysis:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;All analyses were by intention to treat, whereby participants were analysed in the arm to which they were randomised irrespective of whether they complied with the intervention.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial used intention-to-treat analysis, which includes all data from participants regardless of whether they complied with the intervention. This approach is consistent with usual care settings, where patients may not always adhere to treatment recommendations.

Score: [5]</pre>

<p><i><span style="border-bottom: 1px dashed black;">9 quote(s) from
publication full text</span> (mean similarity 100%)</i></p>
<pre>
1. Eligibility:
* Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Inclusion criteria were: age of 18 years or above; BDI score of at least 14 on two consecutive occasions and no treatment from psychologist, psychotherapist or psychiatrist within the last three months.&quot;</span>
* Reasoning: The eligibility criteria for this trial are relatively broad, including adults with a BDI score of at least 14 and no recent treatment from a mental health professional. This suggests that the trial is aiming to include a diverse range of participants, which is more pragmatic than explanatory.
* Score: [4]
1. Recruitment:
* Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Our initial aim was to recruit 24 participants between 22 October 2008 and 31 January 2009 (101 days; 7.1 participants/month) with candidates identified by three neurologists working in a single weekly specialist MS clinic (Sheffield Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust).&quot;</span>
* Reasoning: The recruitment strategy for this trial involved identifying potential participants through a specialist MS clinic, which is a more pragmatic approach than using targeted advertising or other more explanatory methods.
* Score: [4]
1. Setting:
* Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The MS services in both sites are specific entities and not general neurology clinics.&quot;</span>
* Reasoning: The trial was conducted in specialized MS clinics, which is a more pragmatic setting than a single academic or research center.
* Score: [4]
1. Organization:
* Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The study statisticians and principal investigator remained blinded to the treatment allocation codes until after the final analysis.&quot;</span>
* Reasoning: The trial was organized in a way that minimized potential sources of bias, such as blinding the study statisticians and principal investigator to treatment allocation. This suggests a more explanatory approach.
* Score: [2]
1. Flexibility (delivery):
* Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Beating the Blues® consists of eight computer-interactive sessions, of approximately 50 minutes each in duration, designed to be taken weekly.&quot;</span>
* Reasoning: The trial intervention, computerized CBT, was delivered in a structured and standardized way, with specific session lengths and frequency. This suggests a more explanatory approach.
* Score: [2]
1. Flexibility (adherence):
* Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Of the 12 patients in the CCBT arm, 9 (75%) completed at least four, and 6 completed all 8 CCBT sessions.&quot;</span>
* Reasoning: The trial allowed for some flexibility in adherence to the intervention, with participants able to complete at least four sessions. However, the trial also had a specific goal of completing all eight sessions, which suggests a more explanatory approach.
* Score: [3]
1. Follow-up:
* Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Primary outcome assessments were available for 21 (88%) participants at 8 weeks from randomisation (or end of treatment if later) and 18 (75%) participants at a further three months’ follow-up.&quot;</span>
* Reasoning: The trial had a relatively high follow-up rate, with 88% of participants completing the primary outcome assessment at 8 weeks and 75% completing the follow-up assessment at 3 months. This suggests a more pragmatic approach.
* Score: [4]
1. Primary outcome:
* Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The primary clinical endpoint was the mean change in self-reported symptoms of depression as measured on the BDI.&quot;</span>
* Reasoning: The trial's primary outcome was a self-reported measure of depression symptoms, which is a more pragmatic approach than using a clinician-rated measure or a more objective outcome.
* Score: [5]
1. Primary analysis:
* Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Statistical analysis was mainly descriptive.&quot;</span>
* Reasoning: The trial's primary analysis was mainly descriptive, which is a more pragmatic approach than using more complex statistical methods.
* Score: [5]</pre>

<p><i><span style="border-bottom: 1px dashed black;">9 quote(s) from
publication full text</span> (mean similarity 95.8%)</i></p>
<pre>
1. Eligibility:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Patients (N = 861) were randomly assigned 1:1 to receive GA20 (n = 430) or GA40 (n = 431) during the core phase.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: The trial includes a large number of participants and does not seem to have many exclusion criteria, as it only excludes patients with previous exposure to GA40. This suggests that the participants in the trial are similar to those who would receive this intervention in usual care.
Score: [4]

2. Recruitment:
Quote: <span title='Major quote deviation, possible hallucination. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 62.9%):

cted at 88 study centers in 14 countries' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: red'>&quot;Patients were recruited from 88 study centers in 14 countries.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: The trial recruited participants from multiple centers in various countries, which suggests that the recruitment methods are similar to those used in usual care. However, the trial does not provide specific information on the recruitment process, so it is difficult to determine the extent to which extra effort was made to recruit participants.
Score: [3]

3. Setting:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The CONFIDENCE study was a multinational, multicenter, randomized, parallel-group, phase 4, open-label study conducted at 88 study centers in 14 countries.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: The trial was conducted in multiple centers across various countries, which suggests that the setting is similar to that of usual care. However, the trial does not provide specific information on the types of centers involved (e.g., academic vs. community centers), so it is difficult to determine the extent to which the setting is identical to usual care.
Score: [4]

4. Organization:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Patients in the study received treatment for 6 months, and the study was conducted during a period starting in August 2015 and ending in January 2017.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: The trial was conducted over a relatively short period of time (6 months), which suggests that the resources, provider expertise, and organization of care delivery are similar to those available in usual care. However, the trial does not provide specific information on the resources and expertise required for the intervention, so it is difficult to determine the extent to which the organization is identical to usual care.
Score: [4]

5. Flexibility (delivery):
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Patients were randomly assigned 1:1 to receive subcutaneous injections of GA40 (n = 431) or GA20 (n = 430).&quot;</span>
Reasoning: The trial specifies the mode of delivery for the intervention (subcutaneous injections), which suggests that there is some flexibility in how the intervention is delivered. However, the trial does not provide specific information on the extent to which the intervention can be tailored to individual patients or the extent to which co-interventions are allowed, so it is difficult to determine the extent to which the flexibility is identical to usual care.
Score: [3]

6. Flexibility (adherence):
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Treatment adherence was measured by Multiple Sclerosis Treatment Adherence Questionnaire.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: The trial measures treatment adherence using a questionnaire, which suggests that there is some flexibility in how participants must adhere to the intervention. However, the trial does not provide specific information on the extent to which participants are encouraged to adhere to the intervention or the extent to which measures are taken to improve adherence, so it is difficult to determine the extent to which the flexibility is identical to usual care.
Score: [3]

7. Follow-up:
Quote: <span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 99.2%):

Patients also participated in self-reported, daily athome MSQ assessments on Days 1 through 7 after the baseline visit.' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;Patients also participated in self-reported, daily at-home MSQ assessments on Days 1 through 7 after the baseline visit.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: The trial includes self-reported, daily assessments, which suggests that the intensity of measurement and follow-up is similar to that of usual care. However, the trial does not provide specific information on the frequency or duration of follow-up visits, so it is difficult to determine the extent to which the follow-up is identical to usual care.
Score: [3]

8. Primary outcome:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The primary endpoint was patient-reported medication satisfaction using the Medication Satisfaction Questionnaire (MSQ).&quot;</span>
Reasoning: The trial uses a patient-reported outcome as the primary endpoint, which suggests that the outcome is relevant to participants. However, the trial does not provide specific information on the extent to which the outcome is of obvious importance to participants or the extent to which it is measured at an earlier time than in usual care, so it is difficult to determine the extent to which the outcome is identical to usual care.
Score: [4]

9. Primary analysis:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis set included all randomly assigned participants and were analyzed according to the treatment group to which they were randomly assigned, regardless of which treatment they actually received.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: The trial uses an intention-to-treat analysis, which suggests that all data are included in the analysis of the primary outcome. However, the trial does not provide specific information on the extent to which ineligible post-randomization participants are excluded or the extent to which only completers or those following the treatment protocol are included, so it is difficult to determine the extent to which the analysis is identical to usual care.

<pre>
1. Eligibility:
* Quote 1: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;People with relapsing–remitting MS were randomly allocated to either a PRT program&quot;</span> [...] <span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 98.1%):

(n ¼ 36), or usual care plus an attention and social program conducted once a week for 10 weeks (n ¼ 35).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot; (n = 36), or usual care plus an attention and social program conducted once a week for 10 weeks (n = 35).&quot;</span>
* Quote 2: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;To be included, people had to be aged 18 years or more, have a confirmed diagnosis of relapsing–remitting MS, have an Ambulation Index score of 2, 3 or 4 (mild to moderate walking disabilities), and have received medical clearance to participate.&quot;</span>
* Quote 3: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Volunteers were excluded if they had an acute exacerbation of MS within 2 months of starting the program, had benign or progressive/relapsing types of MS, had a serious unstable medical condition, had any concurrent condition, for example stroke, or had participated in a PRT program in the 6 months before training started.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial included participants with relapsing–remitting MS who had mild to moderate walking disabilities and excluded those with other types of MS or serious medical conditions. The inclusion and exclusion criteria are similar to those used in usual care settings, making the trial more pragmatic. However, the exclusion of participants who had participated in a PRT program in the past 6 months may not reflect usual care practices.

Score: [4]

1. Recruitment:
* Quote 1: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants were recruited through a statewide organization providing education and support to people with MS, and a large specialist MS outpatient clinic.&quot;</span>
* Quote 2: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Recruitment information flyers were sent by mail to all potential participants registered on the mailing lists of both organizations.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial recruited participants through organizations providing education and support to people with MS and a specialist outpatient clinic. This approach is similar to how patients would be engaged in usual care settings, making the trial more pragmatic.

Score: [5]

1. Setting:
* Quote 1: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The experimental group completed a 10-week (two times per week), PRT program in one of four community gymnasiums in metropolitan and regional areas.&quot;</span>
* Quote 2: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The control group received 'usual care' plus a social program.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial was conducted in community gymnasiums and usual care settings, which are similar to the settings where patients would receive the intervention in usual care. This makes the trial more pragmatic.

Score: [5]

1. Organization:
* Quote 1: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Each program was attended by a group of up to 12 participants, and they were supervised by up to three experienced trainers (physiotherapists and registered personal sports trainers).&quot;</span>
* Quote 2: <span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 99.5%):

Each exercise session was completed in around 45 min, and at the end of each session there was a 30-min recovery period when the participants had refreshments and time to socialize.' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;Each exercise session was completed in around 45 min, and at the end of each session, there was a 30-min recovery period when the participants had refreshments and time to socialize.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial involved experienced trainers supervising the PRT program and a 30-min recovery period after each session. This level of organization and resources may not be available in all usual care settings, making the trial less pragmatic.

Score: [3]

1. Flexibility (delivery):
* Quote 1: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;While these were the core exercises, they could be individualized. For example, if any exercise caused discomfort, the starting position was modified or the exercise was replaced.&quot;</span>
* Quote 2: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;All exercises were completed on weight machines.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial allowed for some flexibility in the delivery of the PRT program by individualizing exercises and modifying them if they caused discomfort. However, the use of weight machines may limit the flexibility of the intervention in usual care settings.

Score: [3]

1. Flexibility (adherence):
* Quote 1: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants in the control group received 'usual care' plus a social program.&quot;</span>
* Quote 2: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The control program we developed: 1) took into consideration participant choices about content; 2) included some minimal exercise attention control activities&quot;</span> [...] <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot; provided they would not be expected to provide a sufficient stimulus to increase muscle strength; and, 3) minimized the total number of attendances for control participants' convenience while matching the approximate total duration (in minutes per week) of attention and social interaction between the control and experimental programs.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial allowed for flexibility in adherence by providing a social program for the control group and minimizing the number of attendances for control participants. However, the use of minimal exercise attention control activities may not reflect usual care practices.

Score: [4]

1. Follow-up:
* Quote 1: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Outcome measurements were taken three times: at baseline, after 10 weeks to determine the immediate effects of the intervention, and after a further 12 weeks (week 22) to determine if any benefits from the program had been sustained.&quot;</span>
* Quote 2: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;After completing their 10-week intervention programs, participants were asked to return to their usual activities and not to continue or commence resistance training until after the follow-up assessment session.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial included follow-up assessments at 10 and 22 weeks, which is more frequent than usual care practices. However, participants were asked to return to their usual activities after the intervention, which is more pragmatic.

Score: [3]

<pre>
1. Eligibility:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants were clients seen in the multiple sclerosis clinics at Sutherland-Chan School, in which the study was conducted. Clients were provided with information about the clinic by the local chapter of the Multiple Sclerosis Society, and self-selected on that basis. Of the fifteen study participants, all had previously received a diagnosis of multiple sclerosis.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The participants in this study were clients who had already been diagnosed with multiple sclerosis and were seeking treatment at the clinic. This closely resembles the population that would receive this intervention in usual care.

Score: [5]

2. Recruitment:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Clients were provided with information about the clinic by the local chapter of the Multiple Sclerosis Society, and self-selected on that basis.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The recruitment process involved providing information to potential participants through the local chapter of the Multiple Sclerosis Society, and allowing them to self-select for the study. This is similar to how patients would typically seek out and engage with the intervention in usual care.

Score: [5]

3. Setting:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The research project was explained, and written informed consent was obtained. The Multiple Sclerosis Self-Efficacy (MSSE) survey was then given to the client to complete.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The study was conducted in the same setting where the intervention would typically be delivered in usual care, i.e., the multiple sclerosis clinics at Sutherland-Chan School.

Score: [5]

4. Organisation:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;All treatment plans were approved by the clinical teacher in charge. The teacher also monitored treatment delivery, which involved the application of a variety of techniques appropriate to the client’s needs.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The study used the same resources, provider expertise, and organization of care delivery as would be available in usual care. The treatment plans were approved and monitored by a clinical teacher, and a variety of techniques were used based on the client's needs.

Score: [5]

5. Flexibility (delivery):
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The inclusion criterion for the study was a diagnosis of multiple sclerosis, and therefore the spectrum of clinical presentations was broad, as would be expected in this client population. All treatment plans were approved by the clinical teacher in charge. The teacher also monitored treatment delivery, which involved the application of a variety of techniques appropriate to the client’s needs.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The study allowed for flexibility in the delivery of the intervention, as the treatment plans were individualized based on the client's needs and approved by a clinical teacher. This is similar to the flexibility that would be present in usual care.

Score: [5]

6. Flexibility (adherence):
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The inclusion criterion for the study was a diagnosis of multiple sclerosis, and therefore the spectrum of clinical presentations was broad, as would be expected in this client population. All treatment plans were approved by the clinical teacher in charge. The teacher also monitored treatment delivery, which involved the application of a variety of techniques appropriate to the client’s needs.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The study did not explicitly mention any measures to improve adherence or exclude participants based on adherence. However, the flexibility in treatment delivery and the involvement of a clinical teacher in monitoring treatment suggest that there was some flexibility in adherence.

Score: [4]

7. Follow-up:
Quote: <span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 99.3%):

For both treatment and control groups, self-efficacy scores were obtained before the first treatment, midtreatment series, after the last treatment in the series, four weeks after the final treatment and again eight weeks after the final treatment had been received.' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;For both treatment and control groups, self-efficacy scores were obtained before the first treatment, mid-treatment series, after the last treatment in the series, four weeks after the final treatment, and again eight weeks after the final treatment had been received.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The study included follow-up assessments at multiple time points, which is similar to the follow-up that would be expected in usual care. However, the frequency and intensity of the follow-up assessments may have been slightly more than what would be typical in usual care.

Score: [4]

8. Primary outcome:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The outcome measures for the current research were the scores yielded by the Multiple Sclerosis Self-Efficacy (MSSE) survey.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The primary outcome of the study was self-efficacy, which is a relevant outcome for participants with multiple sclerosis. This outcome is likely to be of importance to participants and is relevant to their experience of the intervention.

Score: [5]

9. Primary analysis:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The data were analyzed on an intention to treat basis, with a focus on the differences between mean MSSE values of the control and intervention groups.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The study used an intention-to-treat analysis, which is a pragmatic approach that includes all available data. This is consistent with the approach that would be used in usual care.

<p><i><span style="border-bottom: 1px dashed black;">9 quote(s) from
publication full text</span> (mean similarity 100%)</i></p>
<pre>
1. Eligibility:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Individuals were invited consecutively until the allocated number of standing frames (dependent on commissioning costs) at each health care organisation had been reached.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial seems to have broad inclusion criteria and invites participants consecutively, which suggests a pragmatic approach. However, the trial does have some exclusion criteria, such as being within 3 months of ceasing a multiple sclerosis disease modifying drug, receiving steroid treatment within the preceding month, or participating in another clinical trial.

Score: [4]

1. Recruitment:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants were recruited through eight health care organisations, including the UK National Health Service (NHS) Trusts, social enterprises, and third sector multiple sclerosis therapy centres, in two regions (Devon–Cornwall and East Anglia) of the UK.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial recruited participants through various health care organizations and regions, which suggests a pragmatic approach. However, the trial does not provide details on the recruitment methods used, such as targeted invitation letters, advertising in newspapers, radio, or incentives.

Score: [4]

1. Setting:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The SUMS study was an individually randomised, controlled, pragmatic, multi centre, superiority trial with masked outcome assessments in people with progressive mul tiple sclerosis.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial was conducted in multiple centers, which suggests a pragmatic approach. However, the trial does not provide details on the specific settings used, such as academic centers or specialized trial centers.

Score: [4]

1. Organization:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;All participants received their usual health and social service input throughout the study period.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial allowed participants to receive their usual health and social service input, which suggests a pragmatic approach. However, the trial does not provide details on the resources, provider expertise, and the organization of care delivery in the intervention arm of the trial.

Score: [3]

1. Flexibility (delivery):
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants were asked to stand in the frame for 30 min three times per week over 20 weeks, and to record the frequency and duration of each stand in a daily diary.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial provided some flexibility in the delivery of the intervention, such as allowing participants to record the frequency and duration of each stand in a daily diary. However, the trial also had a strict protocol for the intervention, such as requiring participants to stand for 30 min three times per week over 20 weeks.

Score: [3]

1. Flexibility (adherence):
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;At the end of the 20-week period, participants were encouraged to continue to regularly stand, although no further physiotherapy support was provided.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial encouraged participants to continue to regularly stand after the 20-week intervention period, which suggests a pragmatic approach. However, the trial does not provide details on the measures taken to improve adherence if found wanting.

Score: [4]

1. Follow-up:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The primary outcome was motor function as measured by the Amended Motor Club Assessment (AMCA) score at the primary endpoint of 36 weeks post randomisation.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial had a primary outcome of motor function measured at 36 weeks post-randomization, which suggests a pragmatic approach. However, the trial does not provide details on the intensity of measurement and follow-up of participants in the trial and the likely follow-up in usual care.

Score: [3]

1. Primary outcome:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The AMCA score (range 0–76) is the sum of two subscores. The functional activity subscore (16 items, each scored 0–3) comprises key functional activities of the trunk and lower limbs, such as rolling in bed, sit-to-stand, and sitting and standing balance. The lower limb movement subscore (14 items, each scored 0–2) rates motor impairment by grading hip and knee flexion and knee flexion and dorsiflexion in lying, sitting, and standing positions.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial's primary outcome was motor function, which is relevant to participants. However, the trial used a clinician-rated assessment, which may not be as relevant to participants as a patient-rated assessment.

Score: [4]

1. Primary analysis:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The primary analysis of the primary outcome, AMCA score at 36 weeks, followed a modified intention-to-treat approach, regardless of compliance to the intervention, but did exclude patients who were deemed ineligible after randomisation, those who withdrew from the trial and were unwilling for their previously collected data to be used, or those who did not provide baseline and week 36 measurements (ie, there was no imputation of missing baseline or week 36 scores for the primary analysis), and used an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) approach.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial used a modified intention-to-treat approach, which suggests a pragmatic approach. However, the trial excluded some patients from the primary analysis, which suggests an explanatory approach.

<p><i><span style="border-bottom: 1px dashed black;">12 quote(s) from
publication full text</span> (mean similarity 99.8%)</i></p>
<pre>
1. Eligibility:
   - Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants were referred to the project by themselves, their care-giver, MSI, chartered physiotherapists, neurologists, general practitioners or clinical nurse specialists.&quot;</span>
   - Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Eligible participants were over 18 years of age and had a diagnosis of MS that was confirmed by a consultant physician or neurologist.&quot;</span>
   - Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Persons with MS were excluded if they had a previous relapse or began steroid therapy in the 12 weeks prior to participating in the first assessment, were pregnant, or had a comorbidity that severely impacted their ability to safely participate in exercise.&quot;</span>
   - Reasoning: The eligibility criteria for this trial are relatively broad, allowing for referrals from various sources and including participants with a confirmed diagnosis of MS who are over 18 years old. However, there are some exclusion criteria, such as recent relapse, steroid therapy, pregnancy, and severe comorbidities, which may limit the generalizability of the trial to the broader population of individuals with MS.
   - Score: [3]

2. Recruitment:
   - Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants were enrolled following their eligibility assessments, performed by the regional offices of MSI.&quot;</span>
   - Reasoning: The recruitment process for this trial appears to be primarily through the regional offices of the Multiple Sclerosis Society of Ireland (MSI), which may limit the generalizability of the trial to individuals who are not connected to this organization. However, the trial does not appear to use targeted invitation letters, advertising, or incentives to recruit participants, which suggests a more pragmatic approach to recruitment.
   - Score: [4]

3. Setting:
   - Quote: <span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 99.4%):

All interventions took place in groups of eight, for an hour per week, for 10 weeks. They were delivered in community centres such as local gyms, hotels and health centres.' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;All interventions took place in groups of eight, for an hour per week, for 10 weeks. They were delivered in community centres such as local gyms, hotels, and health centres.&quot;</span>
   - Reasoning: The trial was conducted in community settings, such as local gyms, hotels, and health centres, which closely resemble the usual care settings for individuals with MS. This suggests a pragmatic approach to the trial setting.
   - Score: [5]

4. Organization:
   - Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The PT-led exercise provided was pre-defined. It consisted of a circuit-style class of exercises that were either resisted by body weight or by the addition of free weights.&quot;</span>
   - Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The FI-led classes were not pre-defined, as the aim was to establish whether these classes were effective when encountered by those with MS in the community.&quot;</span>
   - Reasoning: The trial involved both pre-defined and non-predefined interventions, with the PT-led exercise classes being pre-defined and the FI-led classes being non-predefined. This suggests a mix of explanatory and pragmatic approaches to the organization of the trial.
   - Score: [3]

5. Flexibility (delivery):
   - Quote: <span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 99.7%):

In addition to the once-weekly class, participants were advised to exercise aerobically in the mode of their choice (walking, cycling, swimming or running), with the aim of exercising for 30 minutes, twice a week, at an intensity of 65% of the heart rate max, or a Borg’s rate of perceived exertion of 11–14.' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;In addition to the once-weekly class, participants were advised to exercise aerobically in the mode of their choice (walking, cycling, swimming, or running), with the aim of exercising for 30 minutes, twice a week, at an intensity of 65% of the heart rate max, or a Borg’s rate of perceived exertion of 11–14.&quot;</span>
   - Reasoning: The trial allowed for flexibility in the delivery of the intervention, with participants being advised to exercise aerobically in the mode of their choice and at their own pace. This suggests a pragmatic approach to the flexibility of the intervention delivery.
   - Score: [5]

6. Flexibility (adherence):
   - Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants who were allocated to PT-led exercise attended a mean of 8.1 classes (95% CI 7.5, 8.5). Participants allocated to yoga attended a mean of 7.8 classes (95% CI 7.2, 8.3) and participants allocated to FI-led exercise attended a mean of 7.3 classes (95% CI 6.7, 7.9).&quot;</span>
   - Reasoning: The trial did not appear to have strict protocols or measures to improve compliance, as evidenced by the varying levels of adherence to the interventions. This suggests a pragmatic approach to the flexibility of adherence to the intervention.
   - Score: [5]

7. Follow-up:
   - Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Outcome was assessed at week 24 for the intervention groups only, as it was felt that withholding a potentially beneficial treatment for longer than 12 weeks, from the controls, could be considered unethical.&quot;</span>
   - Reasoning: The trial had a relatively short follow-up period of 24 weeks for the intervention groups and did not include a follow-up assessment for the control group. This suggests a more explanatory approach to the follow-up of participants.
   - Score: [2]

8. Primary outcome:
   - Quote: <span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 99.5%):

The primary outcome measure was the physical component of the Multiple Sclerosis Impact Scale29, version 2 (MSIS-29v2), a patient-reported outcome measure that assesses the physical impact of MS.' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;The primary outcome measure was the physical component of the Multiple Sclerosis Impact Scale-29, version 2 (MSIS-29v2), a patient-reported outcome measure that assesses the physical impact of MS.&quot;</span>
   - Reasoning: The primary outcome of the trial was the physical component of the MSIS-29v2, which is a patient-reported outcome measure that assesses the physical impact of MS. This outcome is of obvious importance to participants and is relevant to their daily lives, suggesting a pragmatic approach to the primary outcome.
   - Score: [5]

9. Primary analysis:
   - Quote: <span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 99.2%):

All statistical analyses were conducted using Predictive Analytics Software (PASW) Statistics 17.

1. Eligibility:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;CARE-MS II was a 2-year, randomized, rater-blinded, active comparator-controlled, head-to-head, trial of alemtuzumab (Lemtrada; Sanofi Genzyme, Cambridge, MA; 12 mg/day on 5 consecutive days at month 0 and on 3 consecutive days at month 12) vs SC IFN-b-1a (Rebif; EMD Serono, Rockland, MA; 44 mg 3 times weekly) in patients with RRMS with inadequate response to prior DMTs ($1 relapse during IFN-b or glatiramer acetate [GA] treatment [received for $6 months]).&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial included patients with RRMS who had an inadequate response to prior DMTs, which is a common criterion in clinical practice. However, the requirement of a specific number of relapses during prior treatment may limit the generalizability of the trial results to patients with different disease courses.

Score: [3]

1. Recruitment:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Percentage of patients with recent prestudy relapse was also equivalent between groups (alemtuzumab, 32%; SC IFN-b-1a, 33%).&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial does not provide detailed information on the recruitment process. However, the equivalent percentage of patients with recent prestudy relapse between groups suggests that the recruitment process did not introduce significant bias.

Score: [NA]

1. Setting:

Reasoning: The trial was not double-blinded, which may introduce bias in the assessment of outcomes. However, the trial used blinded raters for key efficacy assessments, which may mitigate this limitation.

Score: [2]

1. Flexibility (delivery):
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Blinded raters performed EDSS assessments at baseline, every 3 months, and when relapse was suspected.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial used a standardized protocol for the delivery of the intervention, which may limit the flexibility of the intervention in the usual care setting. However, the use of blinded raters for key efficacy assessments may increase the flexibility of the intervention.

Score: [2]

1. Flexibility (adherence):

Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The following CARE-MS II tertiary endpoints were assessed: time to CDI ($1.0-point EDSS decrease from baseline sustained for $3 or $6 months, in patients with baseline score $2.0); proportion worsened ($0.5-point increase), stable, or improved ($0.5-point decrease) from baseline EDSS; mean change from baseline in MSFC and MSFC plus SLCLA scores and their components; and proportions worsened ($0.5 SD decrease), stable, or improved ($0.5 SD increase) from baseline MSFC scores.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial used a clinically relevant primary outcome (CDI) that is of obvious importance to participants. However, the use of a composite outcome measure (MSFC plus SLCLA) may limit the interpretability of the results.

Score: [4]

1. Primary analysis:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Reported p values are nominal and not adjusted for multiple comparisons.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial used an intention-to-treat analysis with all available data, which is a pragmatic approach. However, the trial did not adjust for multiple comparisons, which may limit the interpretability of the results.

<pre>
1. Eligibility:
- Relevant quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Eligible patients completed all preintervention assessments before randomization. Randomization was conducted by the principal investigator who had no prior contact with patients and was fully blinded to all patient information, except study identification number of patients.&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The trial seems to have broad inclusion criteria, as it only excludes patients with certain medical conditions or those who are unable to speak or read German. The randomization process is also blinded, which suggests that the trial aims to reflect the usual care setting. However, the full text does not provide explicit information on the similarity of participants to those who would receive the intervention in usual care.
- Score: [3]

2. Recruitment:
- Relevant quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;A total of 164 patients self-referred to the study. Eleven were excluded and 3 declined to participate (figure 1). The remaining 150 patients were randomized.&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The trial recruited participants through self-referral, which is a common method in usual care settings. However, the full text does not provide information on whether additional recruitment efforts were made, such as targeted invitation letters or advertising.
- Score: [4]

3. Setting:
- Relevant quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;All patients in the usual care (UC) group (and in the MBI group) received regular, currently optimal medical care during the duration of the study, as provided by the neurology department of the hospital.&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The trial was conducted in a hospital setting, which is a common location for providing usual care. However, the full text does not provide information on whether the trial was conducted in multiple centers or only in specialized trial or academic centers.
- Score: [3]

4. Organization:
- Relevant quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;MBI closely followed the program of mindfulness-based stress reduction and included 1) a personal intake interview to define realistic goals of participants and establish personal rapport; 2) 8 weekly 2.5-hour classes in mindfulness practices (10 –15 participants/group; exercises did not exceed patients’ level of functioning); 3) one Saturday, 7-hour session at week 6; 4) homework assignments (approximately 40 minutes/day), emphasized as essential to success of the program; 5) a postintervention interview to evaluate personal experiences, goal attainment, and future maintenance of acquired skills.&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The trial intervention, MBI, involves a structured program with specific components, such as weekly classes, a Saturday session, and homework assignments. However, the full text does not provide information on whether the resources, provider expertise, and organization of care delivery in the intervention arm are identical to those available in usual care.
- Score: [3]

5. Flexibility (delivery):
- Relevant quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Mindfulness exercises included observation of sensory, affective, and cognitive domains of perceptible experience.&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The trial intervention, MBI, involves a flexible approach to delivering mindfulness exercises, as it includes various domains of perceptible experience. However, the full text does not provide information on whether the flexibility in how the intervention is delivered is identical to that in usual care.
- Score: [3]

6. Flexibility (adherence):
- Relevant quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;MBI participants reported practicing, on average, 5.11 times/week (SD 2.24; CI 4.59 –5.64 times), a total time average of 76% of assigned homework (SD 13.80; CI 72.76%–79.25%). Amount of practice correlated with improvements in PQOLC, depression, and fatigue (r = 0.25–0.31; p < 0.04).&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The trial intervention, MBI, involves a flexible approach to adherence, as participants are encouraged to practice mindfulness exercises at their own pace. However, the full text does not provide information on whether the flexibility in how participants must adhere to the intervention is identical to that in usual care.
- Score: [3]

7. Follow-up:
- Relevant quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Assessments were made at baseline, postintervention, and 6 months follow-up.&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The trial involves a follow-up period of 6 months, which is longer than the usual care setting. However, the full text does not provide information on whether the intensity of measurement and follow-up of participants in the trial is identical to that in usual care.
- Score: [3]

8. Primary outcome:
- Relevant quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Primary outcomes included disease-specific and disease-aspecific HRQOL, depression, and fatigue.&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The trial's primary outcomes are relevant to participants, as they focus on health-related quality of life, depression, and fatigue. However, the full text does not provide information on whether the primary outcome is of obvious importance to participants or whether it uses a surrogate or physiological outcome.
- Score: [4]

9. Primary analysis:
- Relevant quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Employing intention-to-treat analysis, MBI, compared with UC, improved nonphysical dimensions of primary outcomes at postintervention and follow-up (p < 0.002); effect sizes, 0.4–0.9 posttreatment and 0.3–0.5 at follow-up.&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The trial employs intention-to-treat analysis, which includes all available data in the analysis of the primary outcome. However, the full text does not provide information on whether the primary analysis excludes ineligible post-randomization participants, includes only completers, or follows the treatment protocol.

<pre>
1. Eligibility:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Subjects were eligible for recruiting if they met the following criteria: (1) age > 18 years; (2) established diagnosis of the specific pathological condition MS, stroke or tBI; (3) nine hole peg test (NHPG) performed in more than 25 seconds; (4) ability to move at least one peg in 180 seconds during the NHPG; (5) sufficient autonomous functioning; (6) internet connection or telephone line and reachable internet provider; (7) clinical status stable; (8) discharged from hospital or rehabilitation setting – person lives at home.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The eligibility criteria for this trial are relatively broad and inclusive, allowing for a wide range of patients with chronic stroke, traumatic brain injury (tBI), and multiple sclerosis (MS) to participate. The criteria focus on ensuring that participants have a stable clinical status, are able to perform basic tasks, and have access to necessary technology. These criteria are similar to those that would be used in usual care settings, making the trial more pragmatic in nature.

Score: [4]

1. Recruitment:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Patients were recruited from Unità Organica di riabilitazione Intensiva Neuromotoria (UOrIN, Italy), Foundation Institute Guttmann (FPING, Spain) and from National Multiple Sclerosis centre (NMSc, Belgium).&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The recruitment strategy for this trial involved recruiting patients from multiple centers, including rehabilitation centers and a multiple sclerosis center. This approach is similar to how patients would be recruited in usual care settings, making the trial more pragmatic in nature. However, the full text does not provide information on the specific methods used to recruit patients, such as whether targeted invitation letters or advertising were used.

Score: [3]

1. Setting:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;all measurements were performed at the centre where the patient had been treated.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial was conducted in the same settings where patients had previously received treatment, which is similar to how patients would receive care in usual care settings. This makes the trial more pragmatic in nature.

Score: [5]

1. Organization:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;the physicians of the three rehabilitation centres included patients following the inclusion and exclusion criteria.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial was organized in a way that is similar to how care would be delivered in usual care settings, with physicians at rehabilitation centers including patients based on inclusion and exclusion criteria. However, the full text does not provide information on the resources, provider expertise, and organization of care delivery in the intervention arm of the trial compared to usual care.

Score: [3]

1. Flexibility (delivery):
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;the actual intervention with the H-caD system at home consisted of one month, whereby the patients had an average of one training session a day lasting 30 minutes for at least 5 days a week.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial allowed for some flexibility in the delivery of the intervention, with patients having the option to complete training sessions at home for a period of one month. However, the trial also had a strict protocol for the delivery of the intervention, with patients required to complete an average of one training session per day for at least 5 days per week. This makes the trial more explanatory in nature.

Score: [2]

1. Flexibility (adherence):
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;the patient and the therapist had a weekly scheduled videoconference.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial allowed for some flexibility in terms of adherence to the intervention, with patients and therapists having the option to participate in weekly videoconferences. However, the trial also had a strict protocol for monitoring adherence, with patients required to complete an average of one training session per day for at least 5 days per week. This makes the trial more explanatory in nature.

Score: [2]

1. Follow-up:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;a month after t2 a follow up measurement was performed (t3) for the intervention group.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial included a follow-up measurement one month after the intervention period, which is similar to how patients would be followed up in usual care settings. However, the full text does not provide information on the intensity of measurement and follow-up of participants in the trial compared to usual care.

Score: [3]

1. Primary outcome:
Quote: <span title='Major quote deviation, possible hallucination. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 65.4%):

ele-rehAbIlItAtIon clInIcAl trIAl was: is the use of the H-caD system for one month at least as good as usual care for the arm/hand function in stroke, tBI and MS patients?' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: red'>&quot;the main research question in this validation trial clinical assessment of the HeLLODOc tele-rehabilitation service was: is the use of the H-caD system for one month at least as good as usual care for the arm/hand function in stroke, tBI and MS patients?&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The primary outcome of the trial was to determine whether the use of the H-caD system was at least as effective as usual care for improving arm/hand function in patients with chronic stroke, traumatic brain injury (tBI), and multiple sclerosis (MS). This outcome is relevant to participants, as it addresses a common concern for patients with these conditions.

Score: [5]

1. Primary analysis:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;the goal of the clinical trial was to show that the effect of a new treatment (H-caD) is equal effective as the existing treatment (usual care).&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The primary analysis of the trial aimed to determine whether the effect of the H-caD system was equal to that of usual care. This analysis included all available data and used an intention-to-treat approach, making it more pragmatic in nature.

1. Eligibility:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Patients in South East London who were severely affected by MS were referred by clinicians to the trial.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: The trial included patients who were severely affected by MS, which is similar to the usual care population. However, the trial did not specify any other inclusion or exclusion criteria, which suggests that the trial may have been more pragmatic than explanatory in this domain.
Score: [4]
2. Recruitment:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;After baseline interview, patients were randomly allocated to either a multiprofessional palliative care team (PCT) immediately (fast track) or the control care group who continued best usual care for three months and then were offered the PCT.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: The trial used a fast-track design, which is a pragmatic approach to recruitment. The trial did not use targeted invitation letters, advertising, or incentives to recruit participants, which suggests that the trial was more pragmatic than explanatory in this domain.
Score: [5]
3. Setting:
Quote: <span title='Moderate quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 86.7%):

the trial (Fig. 1). Inclusion criteria were patients in South East London,' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ff9e81'>&quot;The trial was conducted in South East London.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: The trial was conducted in a single geographic area, which is a more explanatory approach to setting. However, the trial did not specify whether the trial was conducted in a single center or multiple centers, which makes it difficult to assess this domain.
Score: [NA]
4. Organization:
Quote: <span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 98.5%):

PCT. 18,20 This comprised one part-time consultant in palliative medicine, one part-time clinical nurse specialist, one administrator, and one psychosocial worker, and was based in a large teaching hospital.' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;The PCT comprised one part-time consultant in palliative medicine, one part-time clinical nurse specialist, one administrator, and one psychosocial worker, and was based in a large teaching hospital.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: The trial used a multiprofessional palliative care team, which is a pragmatic approach to organization. However, the trial did not specify whether the trial increased staff levels, gave additional training, or required more than usual experience or certification, which makes it difficult to assess this domain.
Score: [NA]
5. Flexibility (delivery):
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The PCT undertook assessments, suggested ways to improve physical, emotional, social, and other problems, provided specialist welfare benefits advice and bereavement support, and liaised with and acted as a catalyst for local services, both primary and specialist teams.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: The trial used a flexible approach to delivery, which is a pragmatic approach. The trial did not specify whether the trial used a strict protocol, monitoring, or measures to improve compliance, which makes it difficult to assess this domain.
Score: [NA]
6. Flexibility (adherence):
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Patients had one to three contacts (visits and/or phone calls) from the PCT, although a small number (around 12%) were referred for longer-term ‘community’ palliative care.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: The trial used a flexible approach to adherence, which is a pragmatic approach. The trial did not specify whether the trial excluded participants based on adherence or used measures to improve adherence if found wanting, which makes it difficult to assess this domain.
Score: [NA]
7. Follow-up:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Data were collected at baseline, 6, 12, 18, and 26 weeks on use of services, patient symptoms, other outcomes, and caregiver burden.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: The trial used a more intensive approach to follow-up than usual care, which is an explanatory approach. However, the trial did not specify whether the trial used more frequent, longer visits, unscheduled visits triggered by primary outcome event or intervening event, or more extensive data collection, which makes it difficult to assess this domain.

1. Eligibility:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Eligibility criteria for patients: diagnosis RRMS since at least one year, EDSS score ≤4.0, no symptoms suggestive of a relapse, no relapse in the preceding four weeks, willing and capable of participating in the investigations, and having access to the internet for performing the web-based assessments.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The eligibility criteria for this trial are relatively broad, including patients with a diagnosis of RRMS for at least one year and an EDSS score of 4.0 or less. The criteria also exclude patients with symptoms suggestive of a relapse or a recent relapse, which is a common exclusion criterion in clinical trials. The requirement for internet access for web-based assessments may limit the generalizability of the trial to some extent, but overall, the eligibility criteria are relatively pragmatic.

Score: [4]

1. Recruitment:
Quote: <span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 97.4%):

pants were recruited from all over the Netherlands by the patient organisation NMSF, Rotterdam, the Netherlands.' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;Patients were recruited from all over the Netherlands by the patient organisation NMSF, Rotterdam, the Netherlands.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The recruitment strategy for this trial involves a patient organization, which may limit the generalizability of the trial to some extent. However, the use of a patient organization to recruit participants is a common strategy in pragmatic trials, as it allows for the recruitment of a diverse patient population.

Score: [4]

1. Setting:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;CDT was given during three consecutive days in Zorghotel Spelderholt, Beekbergen, the Netherlands, a facility especially equipped for the accommodation of people with impaired health.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The setting for this trial is a specialized facility for people with impaired health, which may limit the generalizability of the trial to some extent. However, the use of a specialized facility is not uncommon in clinical trials, and the fact that the trial is conducted over three consecutive days suggests that it is intended to be a relatively pragmatic trial.

Score: [3]

1. Organization:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The multidisciplinary team included a psychiatrist, psychiatric nurse, neurologist, registered nurse specialized in MS, physiotherapist, dance therapist, and a person with MS.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The organization of this trial involves a multidisciplinary team, which is a common feature of pragmatic trials. The inclusion of a person with MS on the team suggests that the trial is intended to be patient-centered and focused on the needs of people with MS.

Score: [4]

1. Flexibility (delivery):
Quote: <span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 97.1%):

Components. CDT’s components are large group sessions, small group sessions, consultations (carrousel), a theatre evening, and start of the day with a joint activity (optional)' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;The components of CDT are large group sessions, small group sessions, consultations (carrousel), a theatre evening, and start of the day with a joint activity (optional).&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The flexibility of the intervention delivery in this trial is relatively high, as it includes a range of different components that can be tailored to the needs of individual patients. The optional nature of some of the components also suggests that the trial is intended to be pragmatic.

Score: [4]

1. Flexibility (adherence):
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;During CDT, safety aspects and adverse events were assessed and documented by the multidisciplinary team at the end of each day.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The flexibility of adherence in this trial is relatively low, as the intervention is delivered over three consecutive days and adverse events are assessed and documented by the multidisciplinary team. However, the fact that the trial is focused on a relatively short intervention period suggests that it is intended to be pragmatic.

Score: [3]

1. Follow-up:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Assessments were at baseline and at one, three and six months follow-up via online questionnaires.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The follow-up period for this trial is relatively short, with assessments at baseline and at one, three, and six months. The use of online questionnaires for follow-up assessments suggests that the trial is intended to be pragmatic.

Score: [4]

1. Primary outcome:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The primary study outcome was the change in control self-efficacy, assessed by the Multiple Sclerosis Self-Efficacy Scale (MSSES), at six months.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The primary outcome of this trial is control self-efficacy, which is a relevant and important outcome for people with MS. The use of a validated scale to assess this outcome suggests that the trial is intended to be pragmatic.

Score: [5]

1. Primary analysis:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;All endpoints were analyzed according to the intention-to-treat principle using an ANCOVA with the 6-month value as dependent variable, and condition, baseline value, disease duration and gender as independent variables.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The primary analysis for this trial is an intention-to-treat analysis, which is a common approach in pragmatic trials. The use of an ANCOVA with multiple independent variables suggests that the trial is intended to be explanatory to some extent.

<pre>
1. Eligibility:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Inclusion criteria were: 1) having a definite diagnosis of MS from a neurologist; 2) being within 5 years of receiving a diagnosis of MS; 3) scoring at least 10 on the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) [26]; 4) not currently undertaking other psychological treatment for depressive or anxiety symptoms for the length of participation in the current trial; 5) speak English fluently; 6) no current or lifetime diagnosis of psychosis; 7) no current substance dependency; 8) no gross cognitive impairment; and 9) no changes to medications prior and during involvement in the trial.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial has a specific inclusion criterion of having a definite MS diagnosis, being within 5 years of diagnosis, and scoring at least 10 on the BDI-II. However, it excludes participants with psychosis, substance dependency, gross cognitive impairment, and those currently undergoing other psychological treatments. These criteria are somewhat restrictive, but still relevant to the usual care setting.

Score: [3]

1. Recruitment:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants were recruited through neurologists working in a large MS outpatient clinic at the hospital, advertisements on MS related websites and local press releases.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial recruited participants through neurologists working in an MS outpatient clinic, which is a usual care setting. However, it also used advertisements on MS-related websites and local press releases, which may not be typical in usual care.

Score: [3]

1. Setting:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The study took place at a large teaching and research hospital in Melbourne, Australia.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial was conducted in a large teaching and research hospital, which may not be representative of the usual care setting for MS patients.

Score: [2]

1. Organization:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;A senior clinical psychologist and a provisional clinical psychologist (supervised by the clinical psychologist) provided the intervention.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial used a senior clinical psychologist and a provisional clinical psychologist supervised by the senior psychologist to provide the intervention. This is similar to the usual care setting, where psychologists with varying levels of experience may provide treatment.

Score: [4]

1. Flexibility (delivery):
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;All sessions (apart from the first session which was 1.5 h) were 1 h in duration and took place in a clinic room at the hospital.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial had a structured intervention with fixed session durations and locations, which may not be as flexible as usual care.

Score: [2]

1. Flexibility (adherence):
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;All participants in the CBT intervention reported reading and completing all of the materials provided for homework and reported that the intervention was 'very useful'.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial reported high adherence to the intervention, with all participants completing the materials and finding them useful. This suggests that the trial had a high level of flexibility regarding adherence.

Score: [5]

1. Follow-up:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;All participants completed the pre, post and 20 week follow up questionnaires.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial had a follow-up period of 20 weeks, during which all participants completed questionnaires. This is more intensive than usual care follow-up, which may not involve such frequent assessments.

Score: [2]

1. Primary outcome:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The primary outcome was level of depressive symptoms at post and 3 month follow up which was measured with the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) [26].&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial used the BDI-II to measure depressive symptoms, which is a well-established and relevant outcome measure for MS patients with depression.

Score: [5]

1. Eligibility:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants had a confirmed diagnosis of multiple sclerosis, an Extended Disability Status Scale score of 5 (ambulatory without aid or rest for about 200 m) to 6.5 (constant bilateral assistance required to walk about 20 m without resting), stable rehabilitation and drug therapy for 30 days before entry into the study, cognitive scores of over 24 on the Mini-Mental State Examination, and access to the intervention sites using their own or public transport.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The eligibility criteria for this trial are quite specific, including a confirmed diagnosis of multiple sclerosis, a specific range of disability scores, stable rehabilitation and drug therapy, and cognitive scores above a certain threshold. This suggests a more explanatory approach, as the participants are selected based on specific criteria that may not reflect the typical patient population in usual care. However, the requirement for access to intervention sites using their own or public transport could be considered pragmatic, as it reflects the real-world constraints of patients seeking treatment.

Score: [2]

1. Recruitment:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Of the 873 patients on the clinical register for multiple sclerosis 159 patients were deemed suitable for the study. These people were sent invitation letters and participant information sheets. Forty-three potential participants expressed an interest in participating.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The recruitment process involved sending invitation letters to patients on a clinical register, which could be considered a more explanatory approach. However, the fact that only 43 out of 159 eligible patients expressed interest in participating suggests that the recruitment methods may not have been particularly intensive or targeted, which is more pragmatic.

Score: [3]

1. Setting:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The intervention took place at two different geographical locations (Site A and Site B).&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial was conducted at two different community leisure centers, which could be considered a pragmatic approach as it reflects the types of settings where patients might typically receive treatment. However, the fact that only two sites were used suggests a more explanatory approach, as it may not fully represent the range of settings where patients might receive care in usual practice.

Score: [3]

Reasoning: The trial involved a consistent physiotherapist at both sites, but different fitness instructors, which could be considered a pragmatic approach as it reflects the variability in staffing that might occur in usual care. However, the fact that a physiotherapist was present at both sites suggests a more explanatory approach, as it may not reflect the typical staffing arrangements in usual care.

Score: [3]

1. Flexibility (delivery):
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants completed a circuit of 8–12 different exercises for 1 minute each, having a rest (of a minimum of 1 minute) before moving to the next exercise. Not all exercises were performed at all classes, and in week 9 a fifth level of difficulty was added to some of the exercises to encourage progress.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial allowed for flexibility in the delivery of the intervention, with participants able to choose which exercises to perform and at what level of difficulty. This suggests a more pragmatic approach, as it reflects the variability in treatment delivery that might occur in usual care.

Score: [4]

1. Flexibility (adherence):
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants were provided with exercise progress cards and were asked to record which level they performed each exercise at each session.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial encouraged participants to monitor their own adherence to the intervention, which could be considered a pragmatic approach as it reflects the self-management strategies that patients might use in usual care. However, the fact that participants were asked to record their progress suggests a more explanatory approach, as it may not reflect the typical level of monitoring and support that patients receive in usual care.

Reasoning: The trial involved follow-up assessments at three time points, which could be considered a more explanatory approach as it may not reflect the typical frequency of follow-up in usual care. However, the fact that the assessments were carried out within a local hospital's rehabilitation unit suggests a more pragmatic approach, as it reflects the types of settings where patients might typically receive follow-up care.

Score: [3]

1. Primary outcome:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The primary outcome measure was 25-foot (7.6 m) walk time.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The primary outcome measure of 25-foot walk time is relevant to patients with multiple sclerosis, as it reflects their ability to perform a common functional task. This suggests a more pragmatic approach, as it reflects the types of outcomes that are important to patients in usual care.

Score: [5]

1. Primary analysis:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;All outcome measures were analysed on the basis of intention to treat, with all variables summarized and comparisons made between groups and over time.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial used an intention-to-treat analysis, which is a more pragmatic approach as it reflects the real-world variability in treatment adherence and follow-up. This suggests a more pragmatic approach to the primary analysis.

1. Eligibility:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Specific inclusion criteria were (1) ambulatory (can walk 100 m, be capable of walking 100 metres without a walking aid corresponding to a classification of ⩽5.5 on the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS), even if they do use an aid for daily activities; and (2) self-reported to be sedentary or irregularly active at time of study entry (i.e. do not exercise 30 minutes or more twice per week of moderate to vigorous activity).&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial includes participants who are ambulatory and sedentary or irregularly active, which is similar to the population that would receive the intervention in usual care. However, the trial excludes those who cannot walk 100 meters without a walking aid, which may not reflect the usual care population.

Score: [3]

1. Recruitment:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;People were recruited from four multiple sclerosis clinics in three Canadian cities and from posting on media sites.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial recruited participants from multiple sclerosis clinics and through media sites, which is similar to the usual care setting. However, the trial does not specify whether additional recruitment efforts were made, such as targeted invitation letters or advertising.

Score: [4]

1. Setting:
Quote: <span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 99.2%):

The trial protocol for this two-group, assessorblind, stratified, randomized 1:1, pragmatic, trial was published in 2013.' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;The trial protocol for this two-group, assessor-blind, stratified, randomized 1:1, pragmatic, trial was published in 2013.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial protocol was published in 2013, but the full text does not provide information on the setting of the trial. Therefore, it is not possible to assess this domain.

Score: [NA]

1. Organization:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;All were provided with a portfolio of exercise instructions. All participants were contacted every two weeks during the first two months, then monthly thereafter by the exercise instructor by telephone or email for follow-up by the instructor.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial provided participants with a portfolio of exercise instructions and followed up with them regularly, which is similar to the usual care setting. However, the trial does not specify whether additional resources or expertise were provided.

Score: [3]

1. Flexibility (delivery):
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The goal of the MSTEP© programme is to promote regular bouts of activity most days per week, encouraging a balance between rest and activity, and taking into consideration the physical and emotional status and capacity of the person.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial allowed for flexibility in the delivery of the intervention, which is similar to the usual care setting. However, the trial does not specify whether there was a strict protocol or monitoring of the intervention.

Score: [4]

1. Flexibility (adherence):
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;All had their exercise regimens reviewed during the intervention year at the evaluations which were scheduled at 3, 6, and 12 months.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial reviewed participants' exercise regimens during the intervention year, which is similar to the usual care setting. However, the trial does not specify whether there were measures to improve adherence or exclude participants based on adherence.

Score: [3]

1. Follow-up:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;All participants were contacted every two weeks during the first two months, then monthly thereafter by the exercise instructor by telephone or email for follow-up by the instructor.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial followed up with participants regularly, which is similar to the usual care setting. However, the trial does not specify whether there was more frequent or longer follow-up than usual care.

Score: [4]

1. Primary outcome:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The primary outcome was exercise capacity as measured by peak oxygen consumption (VO 2peak) using a modified Bruce protocol on the cycle ergometer.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial measured exercise capacity as the primary outcome, which is relevant to participants. However, the trial used a modified Bruce protocol, which may not be available in usual care.

Score: [3]

1. Primary analysis:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The primary analysis was of the proportion of people making an absolute improvement at the final time point, 12 months.&quot;</span>

1. Eligibility:
Quote: <span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 98.1%):

Subjects had a definite diagnosis of primary or secondary progressive MS, and an EDSS of between 6.5 (constant bilateral assistance required to walk about 20 metres without resting) to 8 (essentially restricted to bed or chair or perambulated in wheelchair, but may be out of bed much of the day, retains many selfcare functions and generally has effective use of' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;Subjects had a definite diagnosis of primary or secondary progressive MS, and an EDSS of between 6.5 (constant bilateral assistance required to walk about 20 metres without resting) to 8 (essentially restricted to bed or chair or perambulated in wheelchair, but may be out of bed much of the day, retains many self-care functions and generally has effective use of arms).&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial includes participants with a definite diagnosis of primary or secondary progressive MS and an EDSS score between 6.5 and 8. This is a specific population that is representative of those who would receive this intervention in usual care. However, the trial excludes those with rapidly progressing disease, additional neurological conditions, or other medical conditions that would preclude them from participating in the study. This is a more restrictive population than would be seen in usual care, but still relatively pragmatic.

Score: [4]

1. Recruitment:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;People moderately to severely affected by MS were recruited from the MS Service, NHS Ayrshire and Arran.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial recruited participants from a specific MS service, which is a more targeted approach than would be used in usual care. However, the recruitment process is not described in detail, so it is unclear if additional efforts were made to recruit participants beyond what would be used in usual care.

Score: [3]

1. Setting:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Setting: Community; subjects’ homes.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial was conducted in the community, specifically in the participants' homes. This is a pragmatic approach that reflects the usual care setting for this population.

Score: [5]

1. Organization:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Subjects assigned to Group 1 received physiotherapy, twice weekly for eight weeks, by an experienced domiciliary physiotherapist within their home.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial used an experienced domiciliary physiotherapist to deliver the intervention, which is a pragmatic approach that reflects the usual care setting for this population. However, the trial does not provide information on the resources, provider expertise, or organization of care delivery in the intervention arm of the trial and those available in usual care.

Score: [NA]

1. Flexibility (delivery):
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Each subject therefore received core treatments aimed to maximize strength, flexibility and function.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial used a standardized intervention that was delivered twice weekly for eight weeks. This is a more explanatory approach than would be used in usual care, where the intervention may be tailored to the individual's needs and delivered with more flexibility.

Score: [2]

1. Flexibility (adherence):
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;None of the control group received physiotherapy treatment during the intervention period.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial did not provide information on the flexibility in how participants must adhere to the intervention. However, the trial did not exclude participants based on adherence, and there were no measures to improve adherence if found wanting.

Score: [NA]

1. Follow-up:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Subjects were assessed at the beginning and at the end of the eight-week intervention period (i.e. either physiotherapy or control) and then again eight weeks later.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial used a follow-up period of eight weeks after the intervention period, which is a pragmatic approach that reflects the usual care setting for this population. However, the trial did not provide information on the intensity of measurement and follow-up of participants in the trial and the likely follow-up in usual care.

Score: [NA]

1. Primary outcome:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The MS impact scale (MSIS 29), which is a measure of the physical and psychological impact of MS, was the primary outcome measure for the study.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial used the MS impact scale (MSIS 29) as the primary outcome measure, which is a relevant outcome for participants with MS. However, the trial did not provide information on the extent to which the outcome is of obvious importance to participants.

Score: [NA]

1. Primary analysis:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;All outcome variables were summarized and comparisons made between groups and over time.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial used a statistical analysis that included all data, which is a pragmatic approach that reflects the usual care setting for this population. However, the trial did not provide information on the extent to which all data were included in the analysis of the primary outcome.

Quote: <span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 99.2%):

The only selection criterion was that the diagnosis of MS was con rmed by the general practitioner. There were no exclusion criteria.' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;The only selection criterion was that the diagnosis of MS was conﬁrmed by the general practitioner. There were no exclusion criteria.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: The trial had very few exclusion criteria, making it more pragmatic. The only requirement was a confirmed diagnosis of MS, which is similar to usual care.
Score: [5]

2. Recruitment:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants were volunteers with MS who were recruited through voluntary organizations, were community based and lived in West London and in counties contiguous with Greater London.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: The trial recruited participants through voluntary organizations and community-based methods, which is similar to usual care. No targeted invitation letters, advertising, or incentives were used.
Score: [5]

3. Setting:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The study was conducted with people with MS living in the community.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: The trial was conducted in the community, which is similar to usual care. No specialized trial or academic centers were used.
Score: [5]

4. Organization:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants were invited to join the study and were accepted when informed consent had been given in writing.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: The trial did not increase staff levels, give additional training, or require more than usual experience or certification. The organization of care delivery was similar to usual care.
Score: [5]

5. Flexibility (delivery):
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants in the intervention group were contacted by telephone, by a health professional employed for the project, and an appointment was made to discuss self-care strategies relevant to each individual and to introduce the information booklet.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: The trial allowed for flexibility in the delivery of the intervention, as participants were contacted by telephone and appointments were made to discuss self-care strategies relevant to each individual. This is similar to usual care.
Score: [5]

6. Flexibility (adherence):
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Individuals were assigned to group or one-to-one sessions by the health professional in consultation with each person, and based on their needs and wishes.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: The trial allowed for flexibility in adherence to the intervention, as participants were assigned to group or one-to-one sessions based on their needs and wishes. This is similar to usual care.
Score: [5]

Reasoning: The trial had a follow-up period of six months, which is similar to usual care. No more frequent, longer visits, unscheduled visits, or extensive data collection were used.
Score: [5]

8. Primary outcome:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Changes in health status were small. However, at follow-up the intervention group had better SF-36 health scores, in mental health (p = 0.04), and vitality (p = 0.05) and considered help with daily activities to be less essential, as measured by the SDDR (p = 0.04), than the control group.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: The trial's primary outcome was relevant to participants, as it measured changes in health status and considered help with daily activities. This is similar to usual care.
Score: [5]

9. Primary analysis:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Scale scores on the outcome measures in the control and intervention group were compared in two ways.

Patients who were not living independently in the community were excluded.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial includes patients with MS who require a multidisciplinary approach, which is similar to the usual care setting. However, the exclusion of patients not living independently in the community may limit the generalizability of the trial's results to the broader MS population.

Score: [4]

1. Recruitment:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;MS patients from the outpatient clinic of the Neurology Department of Pitie´-Salpeˆtrie`re Hospital were prospectively enrolled in the study between March 2010 and July 2012.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial recruited patients from a single center's outpatient clinic, which may not reflect the usual care setting for all MS patients. However, the recruitment process does not appear to involve targeted invitation letters, advertising, or incentives that would not be used in usual care.

Score: [3]

1. Setting:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;This is a prospective, randomized, controlled, monocentric clinical trial in MS patients.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial is conducted in a single center, which may not reflect the usual care setting for all MS patients. However, the setting is not explicitly described as a specialized trial or academic center.

Score: [3]

1. Organization:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Two treatment strategies were compared: (i) an integrated multidisciplinary (IMD) approach, consisting of a half-day individually tailored comprehensive assessment in the MS clinic; and (ii) a standard care.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial compares an integrated multidisciplinary approach with standard care, which may not reflect the usual care setting for all MS patients. However, the trial does not explicitly state that it increases staff levels, gives additional training, or increases resources beyond what is available in usual care.

Score: [3]

1. Flexibility (delivery):

These patients received a half-day (four to six hours) individually tailored assessment by the multidisciplinary group.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial specifies a maximum three-month period for the multidisciplinary assessment, which may not reflect the flexibility in usual care. However, the trial does not explicitly state that it uses a strict protocol, monitoring, or measures to improve compliance.

Score: [3]

1. Flexibility (adherence):

Reasoning: The trial does not explicitly state that it involves exclusion based on adherence or measures to improve adherence if found wanting. However, the trial does not provide enough information to assess this domain fully.

Score: [NA]

1. Follow-up:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Primary and secondary outcomes were assessed at inclusion, and after six (M6) and 12 (M12) months.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial assesses outcomes at inclusion and after six and twelve months, which may not reflect the usual care setting for all MS patients. However, the trial does not explicitly state that it involves more frequent, longer visits, unscheduled visits triggered by primary outcome events or intervening events, or more extensive data collection.

Score: [3]

1. Primary outcome:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The primary outcome was the impact of the strategy on quality of life (QoL) measured using the MSIS-29 scale at inclusion and after six months.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial measures the impact of the intervention on quality of life, which is relevant to participants. However, the trial does not explicitly state that it uses a surrogate, physiological outcome, central adjudication, or assessment expertise that is not available in usual care.

Score: [4]

Reasoning: The trial uses an intention-to-treat analysis with all available data, which reflects a pragmatic approach. However, the trial does not explicitly state that it excludes ineligible post-randomization participants, includes only completers, or includes only those following the treatment protocol.

<pre>
1. Eligibility:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;To be included in the study participants were required to have a confirmed diagnosis of MS, an Expanded Disability Status Score of between 5 and 6.5, stable drug therapy for 30 days, no relapses in the previous three months, no significant co-morbidities such as coexisting cardiac or pulmonary condition and have access to the internet via personal or tablet computer.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The study has a specific inclusion criterion based on the Expanded Disability Status Score, which is not typically used in usual care. However, the other criteria are similar to those used in usual care, such as having a confirmed diagnosis of MS and no significant co-morbidities. The requirement for internet access is also relevant to the intervention being studied.

Score: [3]

1. Recruitment:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Letters were sent to 138 patients from the Multiple Sclerosis Service database, thought to be suitable for the study, inviting them to participate.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The recruitment method used in this study is similar to that used in usual care, as patients were identified from a database and invited to participate. However, the study does not provide information on whether additional recruitment efforts were made, such as targeted invitation letters or advertising.

Score: [4]

1. Setting:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants were recruited from the Multiple Sclerosis Service, at the Douglas Grant Rehabilitation Centre, Irvine, Scotland.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The study was conducted in a rehabilitation center, which is a typical setting for delivering physiotherapy interventions. However, the study does not provide information on whether the intervention was also delivered in other settings, such as participants' homes.

Score: [4]

1. Organization:
Quote: <span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 99.6%):

Each exercise page contains a video in half the screen, text explaining the exercise, an audio description of the exercise and a timer.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The intervention was delivered through a website, which is not a typical mode of delivery in usual care. However, the study does not provide information on whether additional resources or expertise were required to deliver the intervention.

Score: [3]

1. Flexibility (delivery):
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants were advised to undertake the exercise programme a minimum of twice a week and to complete their online exercise diary which was seen remotely by the physiotherapist.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The intervention allowed for some flexibility in terms of when and how often participants completed the exercises. However, the requirement to complete an online exercise diary suggests that there may have been some monitoring and measures to improve compliance.

Score: [3]

1. Flexibility (adherence):
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants were given contact details for the physiotherapist should they encounter any problems.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The study does not provide information on whether participants were excluded based on adherence or whether measures were taken to improve adherence if found wanting. However, the provision of contact details for the physiotherapist suggests that there was some support available to participants.

Score: [NA]

1. Follow-up:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Outcome measures were recorded at baseline and at the end of the intervention period (week 13).&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The study had a follow-up period of 13 weeks, which is longer than the usual follow-up period in usual care. However, the frequency and intensity of measurement and follow-up were not described in detail.

Score: [3]

1. Primary outcome:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The primary outcome measure, the timed 25ft walk, has good reliability and validity in the MS population.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The primary outcome measure is relevant to participants, as it assesses a functional outcome that is important to people with MS. However, the use of a timed walk test is not a typical outcome measure in usual care.

Score: [4]

1. Primary analysis:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;All outcome variables were analysed using repeated measures ANOVA models at the 5% level of significance.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The study used an intention-to-treat analysis, which is a pragmatic approach to analyzing data. However, the study does not provide information on whether all available data were included in the analysis.

<pre>
1. Eligibility:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants required to have a clinical diagnosis of Multiple Sclerosis, persistent foot drop (lasting a minimum of three months) observed during a 5-minute walk test, stable disease (no change in the Extended Disability Status Score or relapse in previous three months), 5° of passive dorsiflexion and tolerance of functional electrical stimulation.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The eligibility criteria for this trial are relatively broad, including participants with a clinical diagnosis of Multiple Sclerosis and persistent foot drop. However, the criteria also include some exclusions, such as those who have previously used functional electrical stimulation or ankle-foot orthosis for foot drop, moderate to severe cognitive impairment, foot drop due to other disorders, and other conditions significantly affecting gait. These exclusions may limit the generalizability of the trial's results to the broader population of individuals with Multiple Sclerosis and foot drop.

Score: [3]

1. Recruitment:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Potential participants were screened for eligibility, and written informed consent was gained prior to randomization.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The recruitment process for this trial is not explicitly described in the provided text. However, it is mentioned that potential participants were screened for eligibility and provided written informed consent prior to randomization. This suggests that the recruitment process may have been relatively standard, without the use of targeted invitation letters, advertising, or incentives.

Score: [4]

1. Setting:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Seven Multiple Sclerosis outpatient centres across Scotland.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial was conducted across seven Multiple Sclerosis outpatient centers in Scotland, which suggests that the setting is representative of the usual care setting for individuals with Multiple Sclerosis. However, the use of multiple centers may introduce some variability in the care delivery and resources available at each site.

Score: [4]

1. Organization:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants randomized to the usual care group were fitted with a custom-made, solid, ankle-foot orthosis by an orthotist, within four weeks of their initial assessment. The recommendations made by the Best Practice Statement for ankle-foot orthoses following stroke were applied.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial's usual care group received a custom-made ankle-foot orthosis fitted by an orthotist, following the Best Practice Statement for ankle-foot orthoses following stroke. This suggests that the resources, provider expertise, and organization of care delivery in the trial were similar to those available in usual care. However, the use of a custom-made orthosis may introduce some variability in the care delivery across participants.

Score: [4]

1. Flexibility (delivery):
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants in both groups were instructed to gradually increase the wear of their devices over the first six weeks.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial allowed for some flexibility in the delivery of the interventions, with participants instructed to gradually increase the wear of their devices over the first six weeks. However, the trial also included specific protocols for the delivery of the interventions, such as the use of a strict protocol for functional electrical stimulation and the application of specific recommendations for ankle-foot orthoses.

Score: [3]

1. Flexibility (adherence):
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Thirty three participants dropped out over the course of the study and although there was no statistically significant difference in drop-out rates between the groups, the proportion was higher in the ankle-foot orthoses group.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial did not explicitly address flexibility in adherence to the interventions. However, the high drop-out rate, particularly in the ankle-foot orthoses group, suggests that there may have been challenges with adherence to the interventions.

Score: [2]

1. Follow-up:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Outcome measures were administered by two unblinded assessors (Rebecca Hunter and A.L.) at baseline (0), 3, 6 and 12 months, except for the Psychological Impact of Assistive Devices Score which was administered at 12 months only.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial included follow-up assessments at baseline, 3, 6, and 12 months, with outcome measures administered by two unblinded assessors. This suggests that the intensity of measurement and follow-up of participants in the trial was similar to that in usual care.

Score: [4]

1. Primary outcome:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The primary outcome was walking speed as measured by the 5-minute self-selected walk test.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial's primary outcome was walking speed, which is a relevant and important outcome for individuals with Multiple Sclerosis and foot drop. This suggests that the trial's primary outcome was of obvious importance to participants.

Score: [5]

1. Primary analysis:
Quote: <span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 99.7%):

A repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) model was employed to analyse the outcome variables where the main factors, Group (ankle-foot orthoses/functional electrical stimulation), Time (Baseline (0), 3, 6, 12 months) and for the speed and oxygen cost of walking measures, the Condition (with/without device) and their interactions were applied.' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;A repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) model was employed to analyse the outcome variables where the main factors, Group (ankle-foot orthoses/functional electrical stimulation), Time (Baseline (0), 3, 6, 12 months) and for the speed and oxygen cost of walking measures, the Condition (with/without device) and their interac-tions were applied.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial's primary analysis included all data in the analysis of the primary outcome, using a repeated-measures analysis of variance model. This suggests that the trial's primary analysis was pragmatic and included all available data.

1. Eligibility:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants were non-institutionalized adults (age ⩾ 18 years) with severe MS and their primary carers. Other patient inclusion criteria were primary or secondary progressive MS, Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score ⩾ 8.0, complex symptoms, and ⩾2 unmet care needs.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial includes participants with severe MS, which is a common condition in the usual care setting. The inclusion criteria are not overly restrictive and reflect the typical patient population that would receive this intervention in usual care.

Score: [4]

1. Recruitment:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Dyads were randomly assigned (2:1) to receive HPA or UC. Allocation to treatment groups was done using a third-party, web-based computerized randomization procedure with stratified minimization for EDSS score, presence of severe cognitive compromise, and center.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The recruitment process is not described in detail, but the use of a web-based computerized randomization procedure suggests that recruitment efforts were not significantly different from usual care.

Score: [3]

1. Setting:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The protocol was approved by the local ethics committees and the study was undertaken in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial was conducted in accordance with ethical guidelines, but the setting is not explicitly described. However, it can be inferred that the trial was conducted in a clinical setting, which is similar to the usual care setting.

Score: [3]

1. Organization:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Based on the principles of PC, each center had a HPA team consisting of a physician (neurologist or physiatrist), a nurse (case manager and team leader), a psychologist, and a social worker. Nurses of the Milan and Rome centers had degrees and worked full time in PC; the Catania nurse attended a week-long individual training course.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial intervention was delivered by a multidisciplinary team, which is similar to the usual care setting. However, the additional training provided to the Catania nurse suggests that there may have been some differences in the organization of care delivery.

Score: [3]

1. Flexibility (delivery):
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;After a comprehensive assessment of the dyad needs based on direct observation and on visit 1 information (available via the eCRF), the HPA team defined the contents of the intervention, involving the dyad and the patient caring physician (the intervention was not intended to replace existing services). Subsequently, the team verified program implementation and reviewed it as necessary.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial intervention was tailored to the individual needs of each participant, which is similar to the usual care setting. However, the use of a standardized assessment tool (eCRF) suggests that there may have been some differences in the flexibility of care delivery.

Score: [3]

1. Flexibility (adherence):
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The trial senior statistician (R.R.) was not involved in study conduct. The blind examiners used a web-based case report form (eCRF), so that visit 1–3 data were available to HPA teams and coordination unit.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial did not explicitly address flexibility in adherence, but the use of a web-based case report form suggests that there may have been some differences in the flexibility of care delivery.

Score: [NA]

1. Follow-up:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The blind examiners used a web-based case report form (eCRF), so that visit 1–3 data were available to HPA teams and coordination unit. After visits 2 and 3, examiners were asked to guess dyad assignment.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial used a web-based case report form to collect follow-up data, which is similar to the usual care setting. However, the use of a guessing game to assess examiner blinding suggests that there may have been some differences in the intensity of follow-up.

Score: [3]

1. Primary outcome:
Quote: <span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 99.3%):

The pre-specified primary endpoints were changes in patient quality of life (SEIQoL-DW) and symptom burden (PC Outcome Scale-Symptoms-MS, POSS-MS).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;The pre-specified primary endpoints were changes in patient quality of life (SEIQoL-DW) and symptom burden (PC Outcome Scale-Symptoms-MS, POS-S-MS).&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial used patient-reported outcomes as the primary endpoint, which is relevant to participants and similar to the usual care setting.

<pre>
1. Eligibility:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The main inclusion criteria were: (1) clinically definite MS diagnosis, (2) fatigue impacting on daily life (Fatigue Severity Scale total score >4) (16) and (3) ambulatory.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: The trial has relatively broad inclusion criteria, including all patients with a clinically definite MS diagnosis and fatigue impacting daily life. The only exclusion criteria mentioned are related to cognitive impairments, recent relapse, or recent changes in medication. This suggests a more pragmatic approach to participant selection.
Score: [4]
2. Recruitment:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants were recruited in three UK centres (Poole, Bristol, Southampton/Portsmouth) from primary or secondary care, or via MS Society newsletters/websites.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: The trial recruited participants from various sources, including primary and secondary care, as well as through MS Society newsletters and websites. This suggests a pragmatic approach to recruitment, as it reflects the usual care setting and does not rely on targeted invitation letters or advertisements.
Score: [4]
3. Setting:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;FACETS was delivered in hotel meeting-room facilities, with the exception of one centre, where it was held in a rehabilitation hospital.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: The trial was conducted in both hotel meeting-room facilities and a rehabilitation hospital, which are likely to be similar to the usual care setting for patients with MS. This suggests a pragmatic approach to the trial setting.
Score: [4]
4. Organization:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Facilitators were all qualified to a senior/advanced level (in the UK minimum of a Band 7 on the NHS Agenda for Change (AfC) grading structure). (17) Facilitators were trained to deliver the intervention at 1-day workshops and psychological advice and debriefing were available for facilitators throughout the trial.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: The trial used facilitators who were qualified to a senior/advanced level and provided training and support for them. This suggests a more pragmatic approach to the organization of care delivery, as it reflects the usual care setting where healthcare professionals are trained and supported in their roles.
Score: [4]
5. Flexibility (delivery):
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The intervention is highly structured. Each session follows the same general format, namely, facilitator-delivered presentations, flipchart discussions, group activities and homework.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: The trial intervention is highly structured, with a specific format for each session. This suggests a more explanatory approach, as it does not allow for flexibility in the delivery of the intervention.
Score: [2]
6. Flexibility (adherence):
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants receiving the intervention continued to have access to services available as part of their usual local care.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: The trial allowed participants to continue receiving usual care services, which suggests a pragmatic approach to flexibility in adherence. However, the trial does not provide specific information on measures to improve adherence or exclude participants based on adherence.
Score: [3]
7. Follow-up:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Outcomes were measured 1 week (baseline) before the start of FACETS and 1 month (follow-up 1) and 4 months (follow-up 2) after the final session.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: The trial had two follow-up time points, which is similar to the usual care setting. However, the trial does not provide specific information on the intensity of measurement and follow-up of participants.

Primary outcome measures These were: (1) fatigue severity (Global Fatigue Severity (GFS) subscale of the Fatigue Assessment Instrument (FAI)), 18 (2) disease-specific quality of life (QOL) (total score on the Multiple Sclerosis Impact Scale, V.1 (MSIS-29, V.1)) 19 and (3) self-efficacy for managing fatigue (Multiple Sclerosis-Fatigue Self-Efficacy scale—adapted from the Control subscale of the MS Self-Efficacy scale). 20' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;Primary outcomes were fatigue severity (Global Fatigue Severity (GFS) subscale of the Fatigue Assessment Instrument (FAI)), (18) disease-specific quality of life (QOL) (total score on the Multiple Sclerosis Impact Scale, V.1 (MSIS-29, V.1)) (19) and self-efficacy for managing fatigue (Multiple Sclerosis-Fatigue Self-Efficacy scale—adapted from the Control subscale of the MS Self-Efficacy scale). (20)&quot;</span>
Reasoning: The trial's primary outcomes are relevant to participants, as they measure fatigue severity, disease-specific quality of life, and self-efficacy for managing fatigue. These outcomes are likely to be of importance to patients with MS.

9. Primary analysis:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The main analysis was intention-to-treat but we also conducted a ‘per protocol’ analysis (excluding participants who attended fewer than four FACETS sessions).&quot;</span>
Reasoning: The trial used intention-to-treat analysis, which is a pragmatic approach to data analysis as it includes all available data. However, the trial also conducted a per-protocol analysis, which is a more explanatory approach as it excludes participants who did not adhere to the intervention.

1. Eligibility:
Quote: <span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 99.8%):

Thirty-five adults were randomly assigned to one of the three groups: a Mindfulness-Based Intervention group (N = 12), Implementation Intention group (N = 11), and a Control Group (N = 12). All the groups received the same Physical Activity program. The Mindfulness condition group received daily training in the form of prerecorded sessions while the Implementation group elaborated their specific plans once a week.' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;Thirty-five adults were randomly assigned to one of the three groups: a Mindfulness-Based Intervention group (N = 12), Implementation Intention group (N = 11), and a Control Group (N = 12). All the groups received the same Physical Activity program. The Mindfulness condition group received daily training in the form of pre-recorded sessions while the Implementation group elaborated their specific plans once a week.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial includes participants with a diagnosis of MS, not currently engaged in rehabilitation, therapy or PA program, aged between 18 and 65, and able to give informed consent and understand French. The exclusion criteria are limited to those who were receiving drug treatment for fatigue started less than three months ago or acute hospital or nursing home, those who were having psychiatric disorders, and those who were not meeting recommended levels of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity. The eligibility criteria are similar to those used in usual care, with some additional exclusions based on the study's focus on physical activity and fatigue.

Score: [4]

1. Recruitment:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants were recruited from two hospitals in the Parisian region, in France receiving outpatient services for MS at a regional medical center.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial recruited participants from two hospitals in the Parisian region, which is a usual care setting. The recruitment process is not described in detail, but it appears to be similar to usual care, as participants were approached by the study coordinator and asked if they would be willing to participate.

Score: [4]

1. Setting:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;This clinical and multicentric trial took place from July 2017 to January 2020, in two hospitals in the Parisian Region, France (Hospitals – CHI Poissy St Germain-en-Laye and R. Poincaré, Garches).&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial took place in two hospitals in the Parisian region, which is a usual care setting. The trial was conducted in a multicenter setting, which is also common in usual care.

Score: [5]

1. Organization:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The procedures for this study were approved by research ethics committees (CPP) «Ile de France XI » (ID: 2016-A00537-44), authorized from The National Agency for the Safety of Medicines and Health (ASNM) and registered under the identification number ID: NCT03785483.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial was approved by research ethics committees and authorized by the National Agency for the Safety of Medicines and Health. The trial was registered under a clinical trial identification number, which is a common practice in clinical trials.

1. Flexibility (delivery):
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Mindfulness-Based Intervention group (MBI) (n = 12) received daily Mindfulness training in the form of prerecorded sessions (6 sessions of 10 minutes each equal to one hour/day) using TailorBuilder (TB) application, aiming at developing awareness of emotions and sensations. Mindfulness practice took place individually at home six times per week, without any assistance.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial used a pre-recorded mindfulness intervention, which is a structured protocol. However, the intervention was delivered individually at home, which allows for some flexibility in terms of when and where the intervention is delivered. The trial also allowed for flexibility in terms of the frequency of the intervention, as participants were asked to practice mindfulness six times per week.

Score: [3]

1. Flexibility (adherence):
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants were asked to listen to the prerecorded sessions and to follow the instructions (e.g., Breathing rhythm, number of steps during walking exercises, speed of execution of the movement). Participants also received a weekly telephone call lasted up to 15 min, during which a detailed report concerning the session(s) was reviewed and adapted if required.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial used a pre-recorded mindfulness intervention, which is a structured protocol. However, the trial allowed for some flexibility in terms of adherence, as participants were asked to follow the instructions and received weekly telephone calls to review their progress and adapt the intervention if required.

<pre>
1. Eligibility:
   - Quote 1: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants eligible for inclusion were adults aged over 15 years with one of the following possible recorded diagnoses: MS, PD and other causes of progressive parkinsonism, motor neurone disease, Huntington's disease and other degenerative disorders affecting the central nervous system, muscles or peripheral nerves.&quot;</span>
   - Quote 2: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;In order to preserve a focus on primarily physical disabilities, dementing disorders such as Alzheimer's disease were not included.&quot;</span>
   - Quote 3: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants whose clinical features appeared incompatible with the recorded diagnosis were excluded, as were those with neurological complications of primarily non-neurological conditions such as diabetes mellitus, or additional causes of severe disability.&quot;</span>

   Reasoning: The trial includes participants with a range of neurological conditions, which is representative of the usual care population. However, it excludes those with dementing disorders and neurological complications of primarily non-neurological conditions, which may limit its applicability to the broader population.

   Score: [3]

2. Recruitment:
   - Quote 1: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Thirty-six of 68 eligible practices (53%) agreed to take part and identified 438 patients.&quot;</span>
   - Quote 2: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;We searched practice diagnostic lists and prescription records and made intensive enquiries for additional patients from individual GPs.&quot;</span>
   - Quote 3: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;We used GP information as the sole method for identifying potential participants.&quot;</span>

   Reasoning: The trial used a combination of practice-based recruitment and individual GP referrals, which is similar to usual care. However, the recruitment rate of 53% suggests that additional efforts may have been made to engage participants.

   Score: [3]

3. Setting:
   - Quote 1: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Setting: Participants' homes in the City of Nottingham.&quot;</span>

   Reasoning: The trial was conducted in participants' homes, which is identical to the usual care setting.

   Score: [5]

4. Organization:
   - Quote 1: <span title='Moderate quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 83.3%):

an expert panel which advised on actions most likely to promote each individual&#39;s physical, social and psychological well-being.' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ff9e81'>&quot;An expert panel reviewed baseline data and advised on actions most likely to promote each individual's physical, social, and psychological well-being.&quot;</span>
   - Quote 2: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;An occupational therapist then visited EG participants to provide education and information and to discuss a personalized 12-month health action plan.&quot;</span>
   - Quote 3: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The comparison group received standardized printed information delivered to their home.&quot;</span>

   Reasoning: The trial used an expert panel and an occupational therapist to provide personalized education and information, which may not be available in usual care. However, the comparison group received standardized printed information, which is more representative of usual care.

   Score: [2]

5. Flexibility (delivery):
   - Quote 1: <span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 99.5%):

The panel received a written report on each participant prior to meeting, and made suggestions centred on each individual&#39;s stated priorities, taking account of risks of falls and sores.' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;The panel received a written report on each participant prior to meeting, and made suggestions centered on each individual's stated priorities, taking account of risks of falls and sores.&quot;</span>
   - Quote 2: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Within six weeks of the baseline visit, participants in the EG received an education visit from the research OT, who provided personalized advice and information based on the expert panel discussion.&quot;</span>
   - Quote 3: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The CoG received the same baseline assessment as the EG. Six weeks later an information package on generic services and condition-specific self-help organizations was delivered to the home by the research OT.&quot;</span>

   Reasoning: The trial allowed for flexibility in the delivery of the intervention, with personalized advice and information provided to participants in the EG. However, the CoG received a standardized information package, which is less flexible.

   Score: [3]

6. Flexibility (adherence):
   - Quote 1: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;EG participants received a single follow-through phone call from the research OT to confirm and reinforce the educational content of the visit, after which EG patients had no subsequent contact with the OT.&quot;</span>
   - Quote 2: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;CoG participants raising any specific queries during the information visit were advised to consult routine sources of advice such as their GP, so as to avoid providing a personalized educational intervention.&quot;</span>

   Reasoning: The trial allowed for some flexibility in adherence, with EG participants receiving a follow-up phone call to reinforce the educational content. However, the CoG was advised to consult routine sources of advice, which may limit flexibility.

   Score: [3]

7. Follow-up:
   - Quote 1: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants were assessed at baseline and 12 months later.&quot;</span>
   - Quote 2: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Information on adverse events was collected by phone at two-monthly intervals between baseline and 12-month assessments, when a general enquiry was made without specific reference to falls or sores.&quot;</span>

   Reasoning: The trial had a 12-month follow-up period, which is longer than usual care. However, the two-monthly phone calls to collect information on adverse events are similar to usual care.

   Score: [3]

8. Primary outcome:
   - Quote 1: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Primary outcome measures were reports of one or more falls or skin sores.&quot;</span>
   - Quote 2: <span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 98.1%):

interview, participants were asked &#39;In the past 12 months, have you fallen? Have you had a skin sore?&#39;' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;At interview, participants were asked 'In the past 12 months, have you fallen? Have you had a skin sore?'&quot;</span>

   Reasoning: The primary outcome measures of falls and skin sores are relevant to participants and are of obvious importance.

   Score: [5]

9. Primary analysis:
   - Quote 1: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;For binary outcomes univariate and multivariate logistic regression were performed.&quot;</span>
   - Quote 2: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Analyses were performed both with and without adjustment for baseline rates of events in the groups.&quot;</span>

   Reasoning: The trial used logistic regression and adjusted for baseline rates of events, which is similar to usual care.

<pre>
1. Eligibility:
* Quote 1: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Fifty relapsing patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) who had been on natalizumab therapy ≥24 months and were contemplating natalizumab discontinuation were enrolled.&quot;</span>
* Quote 2: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Candidates were excluded from the study if active disease was identified at baseline per clinical (presence of a relapse during the previous 30 days) and/or MRI evaluation (active gadolinium (Gd)-enhancing lesions).&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial includes patients who have been on natalizumab therapy for at least 24 months and are contemplating discontinuation. This is a specific group of patients, and those with active disease at baseline are excluded. This suggests a more explanatory approach with some exclusions. However, the criteria are not overly restrictive and may still be relevant to patients in usual care.

Score: [3]

1. Recruitment:
* Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Fifty relapsing patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) who had been on natalizumab therapy ≥24 months and were contemplating natalizumab discontinuation were enrolled.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The recruitment process is not explicitly described, but the fact that 50 patients were enrolled suggests that no extraordinary efforts were made to recruit participants. This aligns with a more pragmatic approach.

Score: [4]

1. Setting:
* Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;This was a prospective, phase IV, 12-month, open-label, single-center single-blinded (MRI) randomised study.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial was conducted in a single center, which may not be representative of the usual care setting. This suggests a more explanatory approach.

Score: [2]

1. Organization:
* Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants who satisfied the inclusion criteria were randomised at baseline (week 0) to either the IDG or the TG according to a concealed computer-generated randomisation schedule.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial uses a randomization process, which is a common practice in clinical trials. However, the use of a concealed computer-generated randomization schedule suggests a more structured and controlled approach, which is more explanatory.

Score: [2]

1. Flexibility (delivery):
* Quote: <span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 99.8%):

IDG: Patients who discontinued natalizumab therapy at once and initiated another DMT (interferon, GA therapy or an oral DMTfingolimod, dimethyl fumatate or teriflunomide) at 1–6 months following the last natalizumab infusion (1–2 months for the injectable DMTs and 3–6 months for the oral DMTs) and tapered group (TG): patients administered two additional natalizumab infusions, one at 6 weeks and one at 8 weeks (14 weeks from study entry).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;IDG: Patients who discontinued natalizumab therapy at once and initiated another DMT (interferon, GA therapy or an oral DMT-fingolimod, dimethyl fumatate or teriflunomide) at 1–6 months following the last natalizumab infusion (1–2 months for the injectable DMTs and 3–6 months for the oral DMTs) and tapered group (TG): patients administered two additional natalizumab infusions, one at 6 weeks and one at 8 weeks (14 weeks from study entry).&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial allows for some flexibility in the timing of initiating another DMT after discontinuing natalizumab therapy. However, the protocol still specifies a range of 1-6 months, which suggests a more structured and controlled approach, leaning towards an explanatory design.

Score: [2]

1. Flexibility (adherence):
* Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Patients in both groups may have received additional optional treatment with intravenous myethylprednisolone (IVMP) in the first 6 months post-natalizumab discontinuation.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial allows for additional optional treatment with IVMP, which suggests some flexibility in adherence to the intervention. However, the fact that this is optional and limited to the first 6 months post-natalizumab discontinuation suggests a more structured and controlled approach, leaning towards an explanatory design.

Score: [3]

1. Follow-up:
* Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Standardised MRI was performed at baseline, 6 and 12 months from the last natalizumab infusion.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial includes standardized MRI follow-ups at specific time points, which suggests a more structured and controlled approach, leaning towards an explanatory design.

Score: [2]

1. Primary outcome:
* Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The primary objective of this study was to compare two modes of natalizumab cessation interventions: immediate discontinuation group (IDG) versus a TG approach as measured by serial MRI and number of relapses during a 12-month period in patients treated with natalizumab for at least 24 months.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The primary outcome is relevant to patients, as it measures the impact of natalizumab discontinuation on disease activity. However, the use of serial MRI and number of relapses as the primary outcome suggests a more explanatory approach.

Score: [3]

1. Primary analysis:
* Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Statistical analyses were carried out using IBM SPSS Statistics 22 (IBM Corp, Armonk, New York, USA).&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial uses statistical analysis to evaluate the primary outcome, which is a common practice in clinical trials. However, the use of specific statistical software suggests a more structured and controlled approach, leaning towards an explanatory design.

* <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Eligible participants were excluded from the study if they were already engaged in a formal exercise program lasting >30 minutes twice per week, experienced an exacerbation within the past 4 weeks, had their MS immunomodulation medications altered in the previous 4 weeks or during the trial period, or declined to be randomly allocated.&quot;</span>

The eligibility criteria for this trial are relatively broad and inclusive, allowing for a diverse range of participants with MS who are able to walk with or without an aid. However, there are some exclusion criteria that limit the generalizability of the trial, such as excluding those who are already engaged in a formal exercise program or have had recent changes to their MS medications. Overall, the eligibility criteria are somewhat pragmatic, but with some limitations. Score: [3]

1. Recruitment:
* <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Community dwelling people with MS were recruited through the Multiple Sclerosis Society of New South Wales and South Australia.&quot;</span>
* <span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 99%):

A total of 77 people were screened; 50 people who met inclusion criterion were randomized into the home-based (n = 24) and the center-based group exercise groups (n = 26) over a 24-month period' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;A total of 77 people were screened; 50 people who met inclusion criterion were randomized into the home-based (n = 26) and the center-based group exercise groups (n = 26) over a 24-month period.&quot;</span>

The recruitment strategy for this trial involved reaching out to community-dwelling individuals with MS through the Multiple Sclerosis Society, which is a common and pragmatic approach. The trial was able to recruit a sufficient number of participants over a 24-month period, suggesting that the recruitment strategy was effective. Score: [4]

1. Setting:
* <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The center- and home-based groups completed an 8-week progressive functional and balance training exercise program.&quot;</span>
* <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The center-based groups of four to six were supervised by a physiotherapist.&quot;</span>
* <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The home-based group was provided with telephone support.&quot;</span>

The setting for this trial involved both center-based and home-based exercise programs, which allows for a more pragmatic approach to delivering the intervention. The use of telephone support for the home-based group also increases the accessibility of the intervention. However, the fact that the center-based groups were supervised by a physiotherapist may limit the generalizability of the trial to settings where such supervision is not available. Score: [3]

1. Organization:
* <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The exercise program for both groups included two, 60-minute sessions per week, held at least 2 days apart for 8 weeks.&quot;</span>
* <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Exercises were aimed at improving gait speed, endurance, and balance.&quot;</span>
* <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;They were individualized, specific, progressed in load, and performed at a moderate to high intensity.&quot;</span>

The organization of the intervention in this trial was relatively pragmatic, with a structured exercise program that was delivered over an 8-week period. The exercises were individualized and specific to each participant, which increases the relevance of the intervention to real-world settings. However, the requirement for moderate to high intensity exercise may limit the generalizability of the trial to individuals who are unable to engage in such exercise. Score: [3]

1. Flexibility (delivery):
* <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The center- and home-based groups completed an 8-week progressive functional and balance training exercise program.&quot;</span>
* <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The center-based groups of four to six were supervised by a physiotherapist.&quot;</span>
* <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The home-based group was provided with telephone support.&quot;</span>

The flexibility of the delivery of the intervention in this trial was somewhat limited, as the exercise program was structured and required participants to attend either center-based or home-based sessions. However, the use of telephone support for the home-based group did allow for some flexibility in the delivery of the intervention. Score: [2]

1. Flexibility (adherence):
* <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants in both groups were encouraged to maintain their usual activity levels and engagement in any other exercise throughout the trial, with any variation self-reported to the treating physiotherapist.&quot;</span>
* <span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 99.6%):

During the 8-week intervention, participants in the home group reported completing a lower proportion of exercise sessions than those in the group exercise program (mean percentage of sessions completed 45% versus 83% P < .001)' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;During the 8-week intervention, participants in the home group reported completing a lower proportion of exercise sessions than those in the group exercise program (mean percentage of sessions completed 45% versus 83% P < .001).&quot;</span>

The flexibility of adherence to the intervention in this trial was somewhat limited, as participants were encouraged to maintain their usual activity levels and engagement in other exercise. However, the fact that participants in the home group reported completing a lower proportion of exercise sessions than those in the group exercise program suggests that there may have been some challenges with adherence to the intervention. Score: [2]

1. Follow-up:
* <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants attended a local community center to complete all assessments at pre-intervention (week 0), post-intervention (week 8), and at follow-up (week 16).&quot;</span>
* <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Two baseline assessments were conducted 8 weeks apart to evaluate the stability of clinical presentation, with presentation considered stable if there was no significant difference between baseline assessments.&quot;</span>

The follow-up for this trial was relatively pragmatic, with assessments conducted at pre-intervention, post-intervention, and follow-up time points. The use of two baseline assessments to evaluate the stability of clinical presentation also increases the rigor of the trial. Score: [4]

1. Primary outcome:
* <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The primary outcome was gait speed (10-meter walk test).&quot;</span>
* <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Secondary outcomes were gait endurance (6-minute walk test) and balance (Berg Balance Scale).&quot;</span>

The primary outcome for this trial was gait speed, which is a relevant and important outcome for individuals with MS. The use of the 10-meter walk test as the primary outcome measure is also pragmatic, as it is a commonly used and validated measure of gait speed. The secondary outcomes of gait endurance and balance are also relevant and important outcomes for individuals with MS. Score: [5]

1. Primary analysis:
* <span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 96.9%):

1. Eligibility:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The pregnant women were randomly divided into three groups at a university hospital in the suburbs of Sao Paulo, Brazil, in order to receive either acupressure treatment, a placebo or participate as part of a control group.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial includes pregnant women in labor with cervical dilations of ≥ 4 cm and with two or more contractions in 10 minutes, which is similar to the usual care setting. However, the trial excludes those with serious preeclampsia, placenta previa, immediate indication of cesarean, dilations at ≥ 8 cm, and those who used analgesics for less than six hours from the study admission time. These exclusion criteria make the trial more explanatory than pragmatic.

Score: [2]

1. Recruitment:
Quote: <span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 95.8%):

Reasoning: The trial uses a random allocation method to recruit participants, which is similar to the usual care setting. However, the trial does not mention any additional efforts to recruit participants, such as targeted invitation letters or advertising in newspapers or radio.

Score: [4]

1. Setting:
Quote: <span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 95.4%):

was carried out between January and August of 2013. The subjects were pregnant women admitted to a teaching tertiary public hospital on the outskirts of the state of Sao Paulo, Brazil.' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;The study was carried out between January and August of 2013. The subjects were pregnant women admitted to a teaching tertiary public hospital on the outskirts of the state of Sao Paulo, Brazil.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial is conducted in a single center, which is a teaching tertiary public hospital. This setting is different from the usual care setting, which may include multiple centers and different types of hospitals.

Score: [2]

1. Organization:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The researcher that was responsible for applying the acupressure went through 32 hours’ worth of training.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial requires additional training for the researcher who applies the acupressure, which is not available in usual care. This makes the trial more explanatory than pragmatic.

Score: [2]

1. Flexibility (delivery):
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The SP6 group with the pregnant women in labor received deep pressure (± 5kg) with fast decompression applied to their thumbs which did not bring about any discomfort. The TG group received a superficial touch that was of very low intensity (± 100g). In both groups the contact was at the SP6 bilateral point, during the contractions, in one period of 20 minutes.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial specifies the type and duration of the intervention, which is less flexible than usual care. However, the trial allows for some flexibility in the application of the intervention, such as the use of deep pressure or superficial touch.

Score: [3]

1. Flexibility (adherence):
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;All of the pregnant women in labor where encouraged during the CB to breath in and out deeply in the direction of the thorax during the contractions and the intervals in orde for their bodies to be totally relaxed (slow thorax-abdomen breathing rhythm).&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial encourages participants to adhere to the intervention, but does not exclude participants based on adherence or use measures to improve adherence. This makes the trial more pragmatic than explanatory.

Score: [4]

1. Follow-up:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The VAS was used and reused immediately after the treatment (VAS20) and 60 minutes after the treatment, once consent had been given by the pregnant women in labor to participate in the study.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial follows up with participants immediately after the intervention and 60 minutes after the intervention, which is more frequent than usual care. However, the trial does not mention any unscheduled visits triggered by primary outcome events or intervening events.

Score: [3]

1. Primary outcome:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The averages for the pain measured using the VAS were not different for the three groups that were a part of the study (p-value=0.0929), however they were less in the acupressure groups immediately after receiving the treatment (p-value=<0.0001). This was also the case where the treatment lasted for 1 hour (p-value=0.0001). This was the case in comparison with placebo and control groups.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial measures pain as the primary outcome, which is relevant to participants. However, the trial uses a surrogate outcome (VAS) that is not available in usual care.

Score: [3]

1. Primary analysis:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The Kruskal-Wallis test was used to make comparisons between the groups in relation to quantitative variables. The Mann-Whitney test was used in cases where significant differences were found for multiple comparisons. The Chi-squared test was used in relation to the association between groups and variables categories. The Exact Fisher test was used in cases where there were at least 20% of the expected values being less than five.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial uses intention-to-treat analysis with all available data, which is a pragmatic approach. However, the trial excludes ineligible post-randomization participants, which is an explanatory approach.

publication full text</span> (mean similarity 99.8%)</i></p>
<pre>
1. Eligibility:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Patients, 45-65 years old, with mild and moderate chronic obstructive pulmonary disease were invited with a family member.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: The trial included patients with mild and moderate COPD, which is a common inclusion criterion in clinical practice. The age range of 45-65 years is also representative of the typical age group affected by COPD. The trial did not exclude patients based on compliance, response to treatment, or risk for primary outcome, which makes it more pragmatic.
Score: [4]
2. Recruitment:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Patients were recruited from each of the primary health care centres and lung physicians’ offices.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: The trial recruited patients from primary health care centres and lung physicians’ offices, which is a common recruitment strategy in clinical practice. The trial did not use targeted invitation letters, advertising in newspapers, radio, or incentives, which are more explanatory approaches.
Score: [4]
3. Setting:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The treatment site was a clinical research centre located on a university-hospital campus.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: The trial was conducted in a clinical research centre, which is a more controlled and specialized setting than a typical primary care or hospital setting. This makes the trial more explanatory.
Score: [2]
4. Organization:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The intervention was provided for 6 months with a subsequent follow-up for additional 6 months.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: The trial provided the intervention for 6 months, which is a typical duration for COPD self-management programs in clinical practice. The trial did not increase staff levels, give additional training, or require more than usual experience or certification, which makes it more pragmatic.
Score: [4]
5. Flexibility (delivery):
Quote: <span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 99%):

this intervention. It was adjusted to the particular needs of young people with COPD in its early stages.' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;The intervention was adjusted to the particular needs of young people with COPD in its early stages.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: The trial allowed for flexibility in the delivery of the intervention by adjusting it to the particular needs of young people with COPD in its early stages. The trial did not have a strict protocol, monitoring, or measures to improve compliance, which makes it more pragmatic.
Score: [4]
6. Flexibility (adherence):
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Patients in both groups found participation in the research useful and important.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: The trial did not exclude patients based on adherence or use measures to improve adherence if found wanting, which makes it more pragmatic. However, the trial did not provide enough information to assess the flexibility in how participants must adhere to the intervention.
Score: [NA]
7. Follow-up:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Data were collected at baseline and at month 12.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: The trial had a follow-up period of 12 months, which is a typical duration for COPD self-management programs in clinical practice. The trial did not have more frequent, longer visits, unscheduled visits triggered by primary outcome event or intervening event, or more extensive data collection, which makes it more pragmatic.
Score: [4]
8. Primary outcome:
Quote: <span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 99.2%):

The 6-month partnership-based self-management program had benefits on the perception of the intrusiveness of COPD and its treatment as regards lifestyles, activities and interests for young patients with the disease in its early stages.' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;The 6-month partnership-based self-management programme had benefits on the perception of the intrusiveness of COPD and its treatment as regards lifestyles, activities and interests for young patients with the disease in its early stages.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: The trial used a primary outcome that is relevant to participants, which is the perception of the intrusiveness of COPD and its treatment. The trial did not use a surrogate, physiological outcome, central adjudication, or use assessment expertise that is not available in usual care, which makes it more pragmatic.
Score: [4]
9. Primary analysis:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The group (intervention) 9 time interaction from a repeated analysis of variance was used to measure whether or not the effect of intervention was statistically significant for variables that followed an approximately normal distribution.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: The trial used an intention-to-treat analysis with all available data, which is a more pragmatic approach. The trial did not exclude ineligible post-randomization participants, include only completers, or those following the treatment protocol, which makes it more pragmatic.

1. Eligibility:
   - Quote: <span title='Major quote deviation, possible hallucination. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 67.4%):

From their computerised asthma registers the practices identified adults (>18 years) who had asked for a bronchodilator inhaler prescription in the previDepartment' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: red'>&quot;From their computerised asthma registers the practices identified adults (>18 years) who had asked for a bronchodilator inhaler prescription in the previous six months but who had not had a routine asthma review in the preceding 11 months.&quot;</span>
   - Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Patients were excluded if the diagnosis of asthma had been made within the previous year, if they had chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, if communication difficulties made a telephone consultation impossible, or (at the general practitioner’s request) for major social or medical reasons.&quot;</span>
   - Reasoning: The trial includes adults with asthma who have not been reviewed in the past 11 months, which is similar to the usual care population. However, there are some exclusion criteria, such as communication difficulties and specific medical conditions, which may limit the generalizability of the trial results to the broader asthma population.
   - Score: [3]

2. Recruitment:
   - Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;We wrote to all eligible patients inviting them to take part in the study.&quot;</span>
   - Reasoning: The trial uses a simple invitation letter to recruit participants, which is similar to the usual care setting. However, the trial does not provide information on additional recruitment efforts, such as targeted invitation letters or advertising.
   - Score: [4]

3. Setting:
   - Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Four general practices in England.&quot;</span>
   - Reasoning: The trial is conducted in general practices, which is the same setting as usual care for asthma patients.
   - Score: [5]

4. Organisation:
   - Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Nurses were told to make up to four attempts to contact the patient by phone.&quot;</span>
   - Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Nurses were given no instructions about the content of the review except that it should reflect their normal practice and be appropriate to each patient’s clinical need.&quot;</span>
   - Reasoning: The trial allows nurses to follow their usual practice and does not provide additional resources or training. However, the trial specifies the number of attempts to contact patients, which may not reflect the usual care setting.
   - Score: [4]

5. Flexibility (delivery):
   - Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Nurses were given no instructions about the content of the review except that it should reflect their normal practice and be appropriate to each patient’s clinical need.&quot;</span>
   - Reasoning: The trial allows nurses to follow their usual practice and does not impose strict protocols or monitoring.
   - Score: [5]

6. Flexibility (adherence):
   - Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Patients were free to arrange any consultations they wished.&quot;</span>
   - Reasoning: The trial does not impose any specific adherence requirements on patients and allows them to arrange consultations as needed.
   - Score: [5]

7. Follow-up:
   - Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Follow up questionnaires on morbidity and satisfaction with the consultation were sent to the patients at three months.&quot;</span>
   - Reasoning: The trial follows up with patients at three months, which is similar to the usual care setting. However, the trial does not provide information on the intensity of measurement and follow-up compared to usual care.
   - Score: [3]

8. Primary outcome:
   - Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Primary outcome measures were the proportion of participants who were reviewed within three months of randomisation and disease specific quality of life, as measured by the Juniper mini asthma quality of life questionnaire.&quot;</span>
   - Reasoning: The trial measures clinically relevant outcomes, such as the proportion of patients reviewed and quality of life, which are important to patients and clinicians.
   - Score: [5]

9. Primary analysis:
   - Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;On an intention to treat analysis, 101 of the 137 patients (74%) allocated to the telephone arm were reviewed, compared with 68 of the 141 patients (48%) in the face to face consultation arm.&quot;</span>

1. Eligibility:
* Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The inclusion criteria were: a positive diagnosis of RA (1987 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria), age 18 years or older and the ability to complete questionnaires unaided. Exclusions were: unstabilised concomitant disease, awaiting surgery and already receiving care from the practitioners involved in the study.&quot;</span>
* Reasoning: The eligibility criteria for this trial are quite broad, including all adults with a positive diagnosis of RA who can complete questionnaires unaided. The exclusion criteria are limited to those with unstabilised concomitant disease, awaiting surgery, and already receiving care from the practitioners involved in the study. This suggests that the trial is designed to be pragmatic and reflect the usual care setting.
* Score: [4]
1. Recruitment:
* Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;After gaining patient consent, demographics and disease activity score in 28 joints (DAS28), patients were randomly assigned using a remote secure telephone randomisation service provided by Leeds University Clinical Trials Research Unit.&quot;</span>
* Reasoning: The recruitment process involves gaining patient consent and using a remote secure telephone randomisation service. This suggests that the recruitment process is similar to what would be used in usual care, with minimal additional effort made to recruit participants.
* Score: [4]
1. Setting:
* Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The study was conducted in outpatient clinics of 10 rheumatology centres across the UK.&quot;</span>
* Reasoning: The trial is conducted in outpatient clinics of 10 rheumatology centres across the UK, which is a typical setting for the delivery of care for patients with RA. This suggests that the trial is designed to be pragmatic and reflect the usual care setting.
* Score: [5]
1. Organisation:
* Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;This study required three practitioners at each centre; a CNS, a rheumatologist and a blind independent assessor. Nine CNS and 10 rheumatologists delivered the interventions. The CNS had a median experience of 10 years in their current post while the rheumatologists had a median of 9 years at consultant level.&quot;</span>
* Reasoning: The trial involves three practitioners at each centre, including a CNS, a rheumatologist, and a blind independent assessor. The CNS and rheumatologists delivering the interventions have a median experience of 10 and 9 years, respectively. This suggests that the trial is designed to reflect the usual care setting, with experienced practitioners delivering the interventions.

1. Flexibility (delivery):
* Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The NLC interventions usually include allocated 30-min time slots in which the CNS takes history, performs physical examination, pain control, prescribing or recommending medication and dosage changes, intra-articular or intramuscular steroid injections, provision of patient education, psychosocial support and ordering blood tests or X-rays. Referrals for ward admission, to the rheumatologist or other health professionals, were carried out as appropriate.&quot;</span>
* Reasoning: The trial allows for flexibility in the delivery of the NLC interventions, with allocated 30-min time slots for the CNS to take history, perform physical examination, provide pain control, prescribe or recommend medication and dosage changes, provide patient education, psychosocial support, and order blood tests or X-rays. Referrals for ward admission, to the rheumatologist, or other health professionals are carried out as appropriate. This suggests that the trial is designed to reflect the usual care setting, with flexibility in the delivery of interventions.

There was little difference in the ordering of non-protocol bloods or referrals to other health professionals. NLC provided patient education and psychosocial support more frequently than RLC, and CNS conferred more with the rheumatologist than vice versa.&quot;</span>
* Reasoning: The trial allows for flexibility in the adherence to the NLC interventions, with longer consultations, fewer medication and dosage changes, fewer intra-articular and intramuscular steroid injections, and fewer radiological investigations than RLC. NLC provided patient education and psychosocial support more frequently than RLC, and CNS conferred more with the rheumatologist than vice versa. This suggests that the trial is designed to reflect the usual care setting, with flexibility in the adherence to interventions.

1. Follow-up:
* Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The primary outcome was DAS28 and secondary outcomes were pain severity (pain-VAS), fatigue (fatigue-VAS) and duration of morning stiffness measured at each study visit. Other secondary outcome measures were at baseline, weeks 26 and 52: RA quality of life; health assessment questionnaire disability index; hospital anxiety and depression scale; arthritis self-efficacy scale; and Leeds satisfaction questionnaire (LSQ). The health economic questionnaire including EuroQoL (EQ5D) and healthcare resource data were collected at weeks 0, 13, 26, 39 and 52.&quot;</span>
* Reasoning: The trial includes follow-up assessments of the primary and secondary outcomes at each study visit, as well as at baseline, weeks 26 and 52. The health economic questionnaire including EuroQoL (EQ5D) and healthcare resource data were collected at weeks 0, 13, 26, 39 and 52. This suggests that the trial is designed to reflect the usual care setting, with regular follow-up assessments of outcomes.

* Reasoning: The primary outcome of the trial is DAS28, which is a measure of disease activity in RA that is relevant to participants. The secondary outcomes are also relevant to participants, including pain severity, fatigue, and duration of morning stiffness. This suggests that the trial is designed to reflect the usual care setting, with a focus on outcomes that are relevant to participants.

* Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Analysis followed per-protocol (PP) and intention-to-treat (ITT) approaches. The former was based on evaluation of all participants who completed the five treatment sessions and focussed on a complete case analysis; the latter was based on evaluation of all trial participants as allocated. For the ITT approach, missing data were imputed via multiple imputation using chained equations; 20 imputed datasets were computed on guidance that the number needed should approximate the percentage of incomplete cases.&quot;</span>
* Reasoning: The trial includes both per-protocol and intention-to-treat analyses, with missing data imputed via multiple imputation using chained equations. This suggests that the trial is designed to reflect the usual care setting, with a focus on including all trial participants in the analysis.

<p><i><span style="border-bottom: 1px dashed black;">16 quote(s) from
publication full text</span> (mean similarity 98.7%)</i></p>
<pre>
1. Eligibility:
* Quote 1: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants randomized to the ‘polypill-based strategy’ received a polypill containing aspirin 75 mg, simvastatin 40 mg, lisinopril 10 mg and either atenolol 50 mg or hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg.&quot;</span>
* Quote 2: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants were excluded if it was felt clinically inappropriate to alter medications.&quot;</span>
* Quote 3: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The doctor could, at any time, change prescription to the alternative polypill version, add drugs on top of the polypill, or withdraw the polypill and substitute individual drugs of their choice.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial includes participants with established CVD or an estimated five-year CVD risk of 15%, which is similar to those who would receive this intervention in usual care. The trial allows for flexibility in the choice of polypill version and the addition or withdrawal of drugs, making it more pragmatic. However, participants are excluded if it is clinically inappropriate to alter medications, which may limit the generalizability of the trial.

Score: [4]

1. Recruitment:
* Quote 1: <span title='Moderate quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 79.5%):

A total of 623 participants were randomized from 33 centres (12 Aboriginal Medical Services) between 9' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ff9e81'>&quot;A total of 623 participants were randomized from 33 centres (12 Aboriginal Medical Services) between January 2010 and May 2012.&quot;</span>
* Quote 2: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Failure to recruit the planned number of participants reflected insufficient resources to continue enrolment.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial recruited participants from various centers, including Aboriginal Medical Services, which suggests a pragmatic approach to recruitment. However, the trial failed to recruit the planned number of participants due to insufficient resources, which may indicate a more explanatory approach.

Score: [3]

1. Setting:
* Quote 1: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;All participants were treated by their regular doctor following randomization.&quot;</span>
* Quote 2: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;No attempt was made to influence the management of usual care participants.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial was conducted in the participants' usual care settings, with their regular doctors managing their care. This suggests a pragmatic approach to the trial setting.

Score: [5]

1. Organization:
* Quote 1: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Prescription and dispensing of the polypill occurred in the same way as for other medications.&quot;</span>
* Quote 2: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Out-of-pocket expenses for the polypill were incurred identically to those for any other drug listed in the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial used the same resources, provider expertise, and organization of care delivery as in usual care, with the polypill being prescribed and dispensed in the same way as other medications. This suggests a pragmatic approach to the trial's organization.

Score: [5]

1. Flexibility (delivery):
* Quote 1: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The doctor could, at any time, change prescription to the alternative polypill version, add drugs on top of the polypill, or withdraw the polypill and substitute individual drugs of their choice.&quot;</span>
* Quote 2: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;No attempt was made to influence any other aspect of their management.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial allows for flexibility in the delivery of the intervention, with doctors able to change the polypill version, add drugs, or withdraw the polypill as needed. This suggests a pragmatic approach to the trial's flexibility in delivery.

Score: [5]

1. Flexibility (adherence):
* Quote 1: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Self-reported use of all medications was assessed at each visit, recorded as the number of days on which medication was taken in the immediately preceding week.&quot;</span>
* Quote 2: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Polypill was discontinued in 90 (28.9%) patients randomized to the polypill group, with four patients subsequently recommencing polypill.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial assesses adherence through self-reported use of medications and allows for discontinuation and recommencement of the polypill. However, it does not provide specific measures to improve adherence if found wanting.

Score: [4]

1. Follow-up:
* Quote 1: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants attended the primary healthcare centres for trial assessments at randomization and 12 month intervals thereafter.&quot;</span>
* Quote 2: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;All participants were also reviewed one month post-randomization and at intervening six month intervals, but these could be conducted by telephone.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial follows up with participants at regular intervals, both in-person and by telephone, which is similar to usual care. However, the trial may involve more frequent visits than in usual care, which may indicate a more explanatory approach.

Score: [3]

1. Primary outcome:
* Quote 1: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Primary outcomes were self-reported use of indicated combination treatment (antiplatelet, statin and 2 BP lowering therapies for 4 of the previous seven days) at study end; and changes in systolic BP and total cholesterol from baseline to study end.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial's primary outcome is the self-reported use of indicated combination treatment, which is of obvious importance to participants. However, the trial also includes changes in systolic BP and total cholesterol as primary outcomes, which may not be as relevant to participants.

Score: [4]

1. Primary analysis:
* Quote 1: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;All analyses were conducted on an intention-to-treat basis without imputation of missing data.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial uses an intention-to-treat analysis, which includes all data from randomized participants, regardless of whether they completed the trial or not. This suggests a pragmatic approach to the trial's primary analysis.

<p><i><span style="border-bottom: 1px dashed black;">9 quote(s) from
publication full text</span> (mean similarity 95.6%)</i></p>
<pre>
1. Eligibility:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Patients were eligible for inclusion if they were aged 16 years or older and presented within 3 weeks after sustaining a displaced fracture of the proximal humerus that involved the surgical neck.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The eligibility criteria for this trial are broad and inclusive, allowing for a wide range of patients with displaced proximal humeral fractures to be included. This aligns with the pragmatic approach, as it reflects the diversity of patients seen in routine clinical practice.

Score: [5]

2. Recruitment:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Patients received their allocated treatment from the recruiting hospital.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The recruitment process for this trial appears to be integrated into the usual care setting, as patients received their treatment from the hospital where they were recruited. This suggests that the recruitment methods are pragmatic, as they reflect the typical process for patients seeking treatment for proximal humeral fractures.

Score: [5]

3. Setting:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The PROFHER collaborators recruited patients for this pragmatic, open, multicenter, parallel-group, superiority, randomized clinical trial between September 2008 and April 2011 from orthopedic departments (fracture clinics or wards) at 32 acute UK National Health Service hospitals.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial was conducted in multiple centers, including both fracture clinics and wards within acute UK National Health Service hospitals. This setting is representative of the usual care environment for patients with proximal humeral fractures, indicating a pragmatic approach.

Score: [5]

4. Organization:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;It was emphasized that good standards of care, both surgical and nonsurgical, should be provided throughout the treatment pathway for the injury, including surgical care or management of the sling, postoperative care, and rehabilitation in both groups.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial emphasized the importance of providing good standards of care for both surgical and nonsurgical treatment groups, which aligns with the pragmatic approach. The trial did not introduce new or experimental interventions, and care was provided by the usual healthcare providers in the participating hospitals.

Score: [5]

5. Flexibility (delivery):
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participating hospitals did not introduce new or experimental interventions for these fractures during the study. To avoid learning curve problems, surgeons and physiotherapists used surgical interventions and procedures with which they were familiar.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial did not introduce new or experimental interventions, and surgeons and physiotherapists used familiar procedures to avoid learning curve problems. This suggests that the flexibility in delivering the interventions was pragmatic, as it reflects the usual care practices.

Score: [5]

6. Flexibility (adherence):
Quote: <span title='Major quote deviation, possible hallucination. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 60.8%):

. Of 125 patients allocated to the surgical group, 109 (87%) received surgery and 16 (13%) were treated nonsurgically. Of Figure 1. Flow of Patient' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: red'>&quot;Of 125 patients allocated to the surgical group, 109 (87%) received surgery and 16 (13%) were treated nonsurgically. Of the 125 patients allocated to nonsurgical treatment, 2 (2%) received surgery shortly after allocation.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: There was some crossover between treatment groups, with a small number of patients not receiving their allocated treatment. However, this reflects the clinical practice, where patients can change their minds or be found unsuitable for surgery after the initial consultation. This suggests a pragmatic approach to adherence.

Score: [4]

7. Follow-up:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Valid OSS responses were recorded for 232 patients (93%) at 6 months, 225 (90%) at 12 months, and 215 (86%) at 24 months, with response rates balanced between treatment groups.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial had high follow-up rates, with over 90% of patients providing valid responses at each time point. This suggests that the intensity of measurement and follow-up was similar to that of usual care, indicating a pragmatic approach.

Score: [5]

8. Primary outcome:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The primary outcome was the Oxford Shoulder Score (OSS), which is a shoulder-specific outcome measure validated in a UK population.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The primary outcome, the Oxford Shoulder Score, is a patient-reported outcome measure that is relevant to participants and has been validated in a UK population. This aligns with the pragmatic approach, as it focuses on outcomes that are important to patients.

Score: [5]

9. Primary analysis:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;All analyses were on an intention-to-treat basis and included all randomized patients in the groups to which they were randomized.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial used an intention-to-treat analysis, which includes all randomized patients in their allocated treatment groups, regardless of whether they received the allocated treatment or not. This approach is pragmatic, as it reflects the real-world situation where patients may not adhere to their allocated treatment.

1. Eligibility:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Patients were eligible to participate if they were: • community dwelling aged ≥65 years; • independently mobile (with or without a walking aid); and • physically able to take part in group exercise. Patients were excluded if they: • had experienced ≥3 falls in the previous year; • had unstable clinical conditions; • would be unable to follow instructions about exercise safely; or • were receiving palliative care. Attempts were made to exclude those who were already exercising at, or above, the target level through a pre-assessment screening telephone call.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial includes a broad range of participants who are community-dwelling and aged 65 years or older. The exclusion criteria are limited to those who have experienced multiple falls, have unstable clinical conditions, are unable to follow exercise instructions safely, or are receiving palliative care. The trial also attempts to exclude those who are already exercising at or above the target level. This suggests a relatively pragmatic approach to eligibility criteria.

Score: [4]

1. Recruitment:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Practices were recruited with assistance from Primary Care Research Networks for London, Derby, and Nottingham. Patients aged ≥65 years were identified by searches of computerised medical records and invited to participate by letter from their GP.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial recruited practices with the assistance of Primary Care Research Networks and identified potential participants through searches of computerized medical records. Participants were invited to participate by letter from their GP. This approach is relatively pragmatic, as it uses existing networks and medical records to identify and recruit participants.

Score: [4]

1. Setting:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;A three-arm, parallel-design cluster controlled trial was used, with allocation at the level of general practice in two centres (London and Nottingham/Derby).&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial was conducted in two centers, London and Nottingham/Derby, and used a cluster-randomized design with allocation at the level of general practice. This approach is relatively pragmatic, as it reflects the real-world setting in which the intervention would be delivered.

Aim To evaluate two exercise programmes promoting physical activity among older people. Design and setting Pragmatic three-arm, parallel-design cluster randomised controlled trial involving 1256 people aged ≥65 years (of 20 507 invited) recruited from 43 general practices in London, Nottingham, and Derby. Method Practices were randomised to the class-based Falls Management Exercise programme (FaME), the home-based Otago Exercise Program (OEP), or usual care. The primary outcome was the proportion reaching the recommended physical activity target 12 months post-intervention. Secondary outcomes included falls, quality of life, balance confidence, and costs. Results In total, 49% of FaME participants reached the physical activity target compared with 38% for usual care (adjusted odds ratio 1.78, 95% confidence interval [CI] =1.11 to 2.87, P = 0.02). Differences between FaME and usual care persisted 24 months after intervention. There was no significant difference comparing those in the OEP (43% reaching target at 12months) and usual-care arms. Participants in the FaME arm added around 15 minutes of moderate-tovigorous physical activity per day to their baseline level; this group also had a significantly lower rate of falls (incident rate ratio 0.74, 95% CI = 0.55 to 0.99, P = 0.042). Balance confidence was significantly improved in both intervention arms. The mean cost per extra person achieving the physical activity target was £1740. Attrition and rates of adverse reactions were similar. Conclusion The FaME programme increases self-reported physical activity for at least 12 months postintervention and reduces falls in people aged ≥65 years, but uptake is low. There was no statistically significant difference in reaching the target, or in falls, between the OEP and usualcare arms.

Reasoning: The trial used a three-arm, parallel-design cluster randomized controlled trial involving 1256 people aged 65 years or older recruited from 43 general practices in London, Nottingham, and Derby. The interventions were the home-based Otago Exercise Program (OEP) and the class-based Falls Management Exercise programme (FaME). The trial used existing resources and staff to deliver the interventions, which reflects a pragmatic approach to organization.

1. Eligibility:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants were included who scored >2 on the General Health Questionnaire 12, a measure of psychological distress, or >7 on the anxiety and depression subscales of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, thus confirming they had low mood.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial included participants with low mood, which is a common condition in people with multiple sclerosis. The eligibility criteria are not overly restrictive and are similar to those used in usual care.

Score: [4]

1. Recruitment:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants were recruited for a randomized trial of adjustment groups for people with multiple sclerosis and low mood between June 2008 and September 2009.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial recruited participants through usual appointments or clinics, as it targeted people with multiple sclerosis and low mood. No targeted invitation letters, advertising, or incentives were used.

Score: [5]

1. Setting:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The details of this study have been published elsewhere.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The full text does not provide enough information about the trial setting to make an assessment.

Score: [NA]

1. Organisation:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The groups were delivered by two Band 5 assistant psychologists, who were supervised by a Band 8a clinical psychologist, experienced in working with people with multiple sclerosis.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial used resources, provider expertise, and care delivery organization that are available in usual care, such as assistant psychologists and clinical psychologists.

Score: [4]

1. Flexibility (delivery):
Quote: <span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 99.2%):

The groups involved teaching people to recognise symptoms of distress and introduced them to strategies to improve their mood.' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;The groups involved teaching people to recognize symptoms of distress and introduced them to strategies to improve their mood.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial allowed for flexibility in how the intervention was delivered, as it involved teaching participants to recognize symptoms and strategies to improve their mood. However, the trial did not provide specific information about the flexibility of the intervention compared to usual care.

Score: [3]

1. Flexibility (adherence):
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants allocated to the control group received all other rehabilitation routinely provided and were offered the opportunity to attend groups once they had completed the study.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial did not exclude participants based on adherence or use measures to improve adherence. However, the trial did not provide specific information about the flexibility of adherence compared to usual care.

Score: [3]

1. Follow-up:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Four and eight months after random allocation, participants were sent a booklet of outcome questionnaires to complete and return by post.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial used a follow-up approach that is similar to usual care, with no more frequent or longer visits, unscheduled visits, or extensive data collection.

Score: [5]

1. Primary outcome:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The main analysis evaluated the total costs of the intervention, resource use and medication at eight months after randomization, but costs at four months follow-up were also recorded.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial used a primary outcome that is relevant to participants, as it evaluated the cost-effectiveness of the intervention. However, the trial did not use a surrogate or physiological outcome, central adjudication, or assessment expertise that is not available in usual care.

Score: [4]

1. Primary analysis:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;A cost-effectiveness analysis was performed comparing the adjustment group with the usual care control group.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial used an intention-to-treat analysis with all available data, which is a pragmatic approach. However, the trial did not exclude ineligible post-randomization participants, include only completers, or follow the treatment protocol.

<pre>
1. Eligibility:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Patients (n = 84) were recruited in collaboration with six Danish regional MS clinics and The Danish MS Society. Inclusion criteria were (1) 18–60 years of age, (2) ⩽2 years since clinical diagnosis with relapsing remitting MS (RRMS) and (3) no relapses or changes in medication status 8 weeks prior to inclusion.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The inclusion criteria for this trial are relatively broad, including patients aged 18-60 with a recent diagnosis of RRMS and no recent relapses or medication changes. This suggests that the trial aims to include a diverse group of patients who are representative of those who would receive this intervention in usual care. However, the exclusion of patients with recent relapses or medication changes may limit the generalizability of the trial to some extent.

Score: [4]

1. Recruitment:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Patients were randomized to the two study conditions by the sealed envelope principle in a 1:1 ratio stratified by line of treatment. Data from The Danish MS Registry served as a national population-based control group, in addition to the two RCT groups.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The recruitment strategy for this trial involved collaboration with multiple regional MS clinics and The Danish MS Society, as well as the use of a population-based control group from The Danish MS Registry. This suggests that the trial aimed to recruit a diverse group of patients from a variety of sources, which is consistent with a pragmatic approach to recruitment.

Score: [5]

Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The study period covers 48 weeks with outcome assessment at baseline (T0), after 24 weeks (T24), and after 48 weeks (T48).&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial was conducted over a period of 48 weeks, with outcome assessments at baseline, 24 weeks, and 48 weeks. This suggests that the trial was conducted in a clinical setting, which is consistent with a pragmatic approach to setting.

Score: [5]

1. Organization:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The supervised exercise sessions were performed twice weekly for the full study period of 48 weeks, and was planned on the basis of four principles (adapted from Stathopoulos and Felson Duchan) 13: (1) individual tailoring, (2) application of exercise types matching the goal of the intervention, (3) progressive overload and (4) sufficient intensity to induce the desired effects of the intervention.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial involved supervised exercise sessions that were tailored to individual patients and designed to match the goals of the intervention. This suggests that the trial aimed to provide a high level of support and resources to participants, which is consistent with an explanatory approach to organization.

Score: [2]

1. Flexibility (delivery):
Quote: <span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 99.4%):

the exercise intervention included 3892 minutes of aerobic exercise at an average intensity of 76.2% HRmax. The exercise sessions consisted of continuous sessions lasting 30–60 minutes with an intensity of 60%–80% HRmax and interval training sessions lasting 30–60 minutes with an interval duration of 1–10 minutes and intensities varying from 65%–95% HRma' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;The exercise intervention included 3892 minutes of aerobic exercise at an average intensity of 76.2% HRmax. The exercise sessions consisted of continuous sessions lasting 30–60 minutes with an intensity of 60%–80% HRmax and interval training sessions lasting 30–60 minutes with an interval duration of 1–10 minutes and intensities varying from 65%–95% HRmax.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial involved a structured exercise intervention with specific durations, intensities, and types of exercise. This suggests that the trial aimed to provide a high level of control over the delivery of the intervention, which is consistent with an explanatory approach to flexibility.

<p><i><span style="border-bottom: 1px dashed black;">11 quote(s) from
publication full text</span> (mean similarity 99.7%)</i></p>
<pre>
1. Eligibility:
   - Quote 1: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Patients with multiple sclerosis were randomly selected into treated and control groups; only patients who could walk with or without walking aids were admitted to the trial, and these cases were initially assessed and scored during an inactive phase of the disease.&quot;</span>
   - Quote 2: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;In Manchester, patients who had relapsed in the previous eighteen months only were admitted to the trial.&quot;</span>
   - Reasoning: The trial included patients who could walk with or without aids and were assessed during an inactive phase of the disease. This suggests that the participants were similar to those who would receive this intervention in usual care. However, the exclusion of patients who had not relapsed in the previous eighteen months in Manchester may limit the generalizability of the results.
   - Score: [4]

2. Recruitment:
   - Quote: <span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 97.8%):

could not be a doubleblind study. A separate trial was carried out in the three centres using the same treatment and scoring methods.' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;It could not be a double-blind study. A separate trial was carried out in the three centres using the same treatment and scoring methods.&quot;</span>
   - Reasoning: The recruitment process is not explicitly described in the text. However, the fact that the trial was not double-blind and that the same treatment and scoring methods were used across three centers suggests that the recruitment process was likely pragmatic and similar to usual care.
   - Score: [4]

3. Setting:
   - Quote: <span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 98.9%):

This controlled study was started in 1963 in three citiesBelfast, Leeds, and Manchester.' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;This controlled study was started in 1963 in three cities-Belfast, Leeds, and Manchester.&quot;</span>
   - Reasoning: The trial was conducted in three cities, which may not be representative of all usual care settings. However, the use of multiple centers could also increase the generalizability of the results.
   - Score: [3]

4. Organisation:
   - Quote 1: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The treated group were given corticotrophin (‘Acthar’ gel) in a dosage which varied between 15 and 25 units daily, potassium chloride orally, and a low-salt diet.&quot;</span>
   - Quote 2: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Both treated and control groups were given aneurin 100 mg by injection monthly.&quot;</span>
   - Reasoning: The trial used a specific dosage of corticotrophin, potassium chloride, and a low-salt diet for the treated group, which may not be identical to the resources and provider expertise available in usual care. However, the provision of aneurin to both groups suggests some similarity to usual care.
   - Score: [2]

5. Flexibility (delivery):
   - Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The dose of corticotrophin was adjusted to produce just enough 'mooning' of the face to be appreciated by the physician in charge of the trial and the dose was not increased during a relapse.&quot;</span>
   - Reasoning: The trial protocol allowed for some flexibility in the dosage of corticotrophin, which is similar to usual care. However, the strict protocol for not increasing the dose during a relapse may limit the flexibility.
   - Score: [3]

6. Flexibility (adherence):
   - Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Patients with diabetes mellitus or hypertension or who gave a history of psychiatric illness or peptic ulcer were not admitted to the treated group.&quot;</span>
   - Reasoning: The trial excluded patients with certain comorbidities, which may not reflect the flexibility in adherence likely in usual care. However, the trial did not explicitly exclude participants based on adherence.
   - Score: [3]

7. Follow-up:
   - Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;All cases were seen at three-monthly intervals and scored on the Kurtzke (1961) scale; relapses lasting longer than twenty-four hours were also scored by a system in the three centres.&quot;</span>
   - Reasoning: The trial followed up with participants every three months, which may be more frequent than usual care. However, the use of a standardized scoring system suggests some similarity to usual care.
   - Score: [2]

8. Primary outcome:
   - Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;There is no evidence to suggest that the treated group do better than the controls, either from the point of view of deterioration or reduction in number or severity of relapses.&quot;</span>
   - Reasoning: The primary outcome of the trial was the prevention of deterioration and reduction in the number or severity of relapses, which is relevant to participants.
   - Score: [5]

9. Primary analysis:
   - Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Altogether there were 181 treated patients and 169 control patients followed up for an average period of eighteen and a half months.&quot;</span>
   - Reasoning: The trial followed up with both treated and control patients for an average of eighteen and a half months, suggesting that all data were included in the analysis of the primary outcome.

   The trial has specific inclusion criteria based on the Poser criteria for MS diagnosis and the presence of a relapse. It also excludes patients with contraindications to bed rest or ACTH treatment. However, these criteria are not overly restrictive and are likely to be similar to those used in usual care.

   Score: [4]

2. Recruitment:
   - Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Three neurological departments in the Netherlands (University Hospital Groningen, Streekziekenhuis Almelo, Diaconessenhuis Meppel) participated in this study.&quot;</span>

   The trial was conducted in multiple centers, which suggests a pragmatic approach to recruitment. However, the full text does not provide enough information on the recruitment process to make a definitive assessment.

   Score: [NA]

3. Setting:
   - Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Assessment of patients was performed by their own neurologist.&quot;</span>

   The trial was conducted in the usual care setting, with patients being assessed by their own neurologists. This suggests a pragmatic approach to the trial setting.

Patients were allocated in a stratified randomisation to treatment with either bed rest during 3 weeks and a synthetic ACTH depotpreparation (1 mg, 100 units, tapered over 12 weeks), and Vitamin B-complex or bed rest and Vitamin B-complex intramuscular injections in the same scheme (5)' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;Patients were allocated in a stratified randomisation to treatment with either bed rest during 3 weeks and a synthetic ACTH depot preparation (1 mg, 100 units, tapered over 12 weeks), and Vitamin B-complex or bed rest and Vitamin B-complex intramuscular injections in the same scheme (5).&quot;</span>

   The trial uses a stratified randomization process and does not appear to increase staff levels, give additional training, or require more than usual experience or certification. This suggests a pragmatic approach to the organization of care delivery.

   Score: [4]

5. Flexibility (delivery):
   - Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Follow-up was performed in the 6th and 12th week of treatment and 6, 9, and 12 months after the start of treatment.&quot;</span>

   The trial has a specific follow-up schedule, but it does not appear to be overly restrictive or different from usual care.

6. Flexibility (adherence):
   - Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Patients were withdrawn from the study if other treatment with ACTH, corticosteroids or immunosuppressive drugs was started.&quot;</span>

   The trial allows for flexibility in adherence, as patients can be withdrawn if they start other treatments. However, the full text does not provide enough information on measures to improve adherence to make a definitive assessment.

   Score: [NA]

7. Follow-up:
   - Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Follow-up was performed in the 6th and 12th week of treatment and 6, 9, and 12 months after the start of treatment.&quot;</span>

   The trial has a specific follow-up schedule, but it does not appear to be overly intensive or different from usual care.

   Score: [4]

8. Primary outcome:
   - Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The major results are summarized in the Tables 2 and 3 and Fig. 1.&quot;</span>

   The trial's primary outcome is the long-term effect of ACTH treatment on relapse in multiple sclerosis, which is of obvious importance to participants.

   Score: [5]

9. Primary analysis:
   - Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;To compare the demographic data and treatment results in both groups, the two-sided Mann-Whitney U test was used with exception of the disease stages (RR, PR, and PP) in which we used the Chi-square test.&quot;</span>

   The trial uses an intention-to-treat analysis with all available data, which suggests a pragmatic approach to the primary analysis.

1. Eligibility:
Quote: <span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 99.6%):

Eighty-six participants were recruited from Danish MS clinics (Aarhus University Hospital, Viborg Regional Hospital, Odense University Hospital, and the MS Clinic of Southern Jutland (Kolding)). For inclusion and exclusion criteria, see LangeskovChristensen et al.' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;Eighty-six participants were recruited from Danish MS clinics (Aarhus University Hospital, Viborg Regional Hospital, Odense University Hospital, and the MS Clinic of Southern Jutland (Kolding)). For inclusion and exclusion criteria, see Langeskov-Christensen et al.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The study recruited participants from multiple MS clinics, which suggests that the participants are similar to those who would receive this intervention in usual care. However, the inclusion and exclusion criteria are not explicitly stated in the provided text, so it is difficult to fully assess the eligibility domain.

Score: [NA]

2. Recruitment:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Eighty-six participants were recruited from Danish MS clinics (Aarhus University Hospital, Viborg Regional Hospital, Odense University Hospital, and the MS Clinic of Southern Jutland (Kolding)).&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The study recruited participants from multiple MS clinics, which suggests that the recruitment methods are similar to those used in usual care. There is no mention of targeted invitation letters, advertising, or incentives, which are often used in explanatory trials.

Score: [4]

3. Setting:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;This was a 24-week randomized controlled cross-over trial.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The study was conducted as a randomized controlled trial, which is a common setting for clinical research. However, the specific setting (e.g., hospital, community center, etc.) is not mentioned in the provided text.

Score: [NA]

4. Organization:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Following inclusion and baseline testing, participants were randomized (1:1) to a PAE or waitlist group using block randomization, stratified by sex. Allocation was concealed by the sealed envelope principle.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The study used block randomization and allocation concealment, which are common methods used in clinical trials to minimize bias. There is no mention of additional resources, provider expertise, or changes to the organization of care delivery in the intervention arm.

Score: [4]

5. Flexibility (delivery):
Quote: <span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 99.8%):

Supervised PAE sessions were conducted twice weekly during the 24 weeks, with one continuous and one interval exercise session performed each week. In brief, the session volume increased from 30 to 60 minutes during the intervention while the intensity M Langeskov-Christensen, LG Hvid et al. journals.sagepub.com/home/msj 3 increased from 65% to 95% of individual maximum heart rate (HR max ). For further details on exercise modality options and the progressing volume and intensity of the exercise sessions, see LangeskovChristensen et al.' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;Supervised PAE sessions were conducted twice weekly during the 24 weeks, with one continuous and one interval exercise session performed each week. In brief, the session volume increased from 30 to 60 minutes during the intervention while the intensity increased from 65% to 95% of individual maximum heart rate (HR max). For further details on exercise modality options and the progressing volume and intensity of the exercise sessions, see Langeskov-Christensen et al.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The study used a structured exercise protocol with supervised sessions, which suggests that there is limited flexibility in the delivery of the intervention. However, the intensity and duration of the exercise sessions were individualized based on each participant's maximum heart rate, which allows for some flexibility.

Score: [3]

6. Flexibility (adherence):
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Exercise adherence was high with 44.8 ± 2.6 completed sessions, corresponding to 93.3 ± 5.4% of the planned sessions.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The study reported high adherence to the exercise protocol, with participants completing 93.3% of the planned sessions on average. This suggests that there were no measures to improve adherence or exclude participants based on adherence.

Score: [5]

7. Follow-up:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;At baseline (T0), after 24 (T24) and after 48 (T48) weeks, participants performed the BRB-N, the Major Depression Inventory (MDI), and a cardiorespiratory fitness test (VO2-max test). Each test session was separated by at least 48 hours from the last exercise bout.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The study followed participants for 48 weeks and conducted assessments at multiple time points. The follow-up schedule is similar to what would be expected in usual care, with assessments separated by at least 48 hours from the last exercise bout.

Score: [5]

8. Primary outcome:
Quote: <span title='Major quote deviation, possible hallucination. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 60.1%):

n cognitive performance, assessed by a validated cognitive test battery (the Brief Repeatable Battery of Neuropsychological tests (BRB-N)).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: red'>&quot;The primary outcome was the change in cognitive performance, as measured by the Brief Repeatable Battery of Neuropsychological tests (BRB-N), from baseline to 24 weeks.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The primary outcome of the study was the change in cognitive performance, which is a relevant outcome for participants with MS. The BRB-N is a validated measure of cognitive function that is commonly used in MS research.

Score: [5]

9. Primary analysis:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;All longitudinal data for the total group and the cognitively impaired subgroup were analyzed using an intention-to-treat linear mixed effects model with time and group as the factors of interest.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The study used an intention-to-treat analysis, which includes all available data from all randomized participants. This approach is consistent with a pragmatic approach to trial design.

Reasoning: The trial included patients who were already on injectable disease-modifying therapies (iDMTs) and were candidates for therapy change. The inclusion criteria were broad, and patients were randomized to switch to fingolimod or remain on iDMT. However, patients who switched from one iDMT to another were not included in the analysis, which may limit the generalizability of the results to patients who switch between different iDMTs.

Score: [4]

Reasoning: The trial recruited patients from multiple centers in the USA and Canada. The recruitment process was not explicitly described, but it appears that patients were recruited through their treating physicians. The trial was completed in a relatively short period, suggesting that recruitment was efficient.

Score: [4]

1. Setting:
* Quote 1: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;EPOC was a 6-month, randomized, open-label, multicenter, phase 4 study conducted in the USA and Canada.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial was conducted in multiple centers in the USA and Canada, which are likely to be representative of the settings where patients with relapsing multiple sclerosis receive treatment. The trial was open-label, which may limit its generalizability to real-world settings where patients and physicians are not aware of the treatment assignment.

Score: [4]

Reasoning: The trial used four different iDMTs, which are commonly used in clinical practice. The trial did not appear to increase staff levels, provide additional training, or require more than usual experience or certification. However, the trial did not explicitly state whether the resources and provider expertise were identical to those available in usual care.

Score: [4]

1. Flexibility (delivery):
* Quote 1: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Patients randomized to the iDMT group either remained on the same therapy or, following consultation with a physician, were switched immediately to another approved iDMT.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial allowed for flexibility in the delivery of the intervention, as patients in the iDMT group could remain on the same therapy or switch to another approved iDMT. However, the trial did not explicitly state whether there was a strict protocol, monitoring, or measures to improve compliance.

Score: [4]

1. Flexibility (adherence):
* Quote 1: <span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 98.9%):

Reasoning: The trial did not explicitly state whether there were measures to improve adherence if found wanting. However, the trial did exclude patients who switched from one iDMT to another, which may limit the generalizability of the results to patients who switch between different iDMTs.

Score: [NA]

1. Follow-up:
* Quote 1: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;All outcomes were evaluated after 6 months of treatment.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial had a relatively short follow-up period of 6 months, which may limit the ability to detect long-term effects of the intervention. However, the trial did not appear to have more frequent, longer visits, unscheduled visits triggered by primary outcome event or intervening event, or more extensive data collection than would be expected in usual care.

Score: [4]

1. Primary outcome:
* Quote 1: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The primary endpoint was the change in Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire for Medication (TSQM) Global Satisfaction score.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The primary outcome of the trial was the change in TSQM Global Satisfaction score, which is a patient-reported outcome that is likely to be of obvious importance to participants. However, the trial did not use a surrogate, physiological outcome, central adjudication, or assessment expertise that is not available in usual care.

1. Primary analysis:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Data were analyzed using SPSS ® 17.0 (SPSS Inc., USA). Results are presented as mean ± standard deviation (SD). Shapiro-Wilk normality test was used to assess normal data distribution.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The study used a standard statistical analysis, which is similar to what would be used in usual care. However, the study did not mention any intention-to-treat analysis or inclusion of all available data, which may limit the generalizability of the results.

Aim To evaluate two exercise programmes promoting physical activity among older people. Design and setting Pragmatic three-arm, parallel-design cluster randomised controlled trial involving 1256 people aged ≥65 years (of 20 507 invited) recruited from 43 general practices in London, Nottingham, and Derby. Method Practices were randomised to the class-based Falls Management Exercise programme (FaME), the home-based Otago Exercise Program (OEP), or usual care. The primary outcome was the proportion reaching the recommended physical activity target 12 months post-intervention. Secondary outcomes included falls, quality of life, balance confidence, and costs. Results In total, 49% of FaME participants reached the physical activity target compared with 38% for usual care (adjusted odds ratio 1.78, 95% confidence interval [CI] =1.11 to 2.87, P = 0.02). Differences between FaME and usual care persisted 24 months after intervention. There was no significant difference comparing those in the OEP (43% reaching target at 12months) and usual-care arms. Participants in the FaME arm added around 15 minutes of moderate-tovigorous physical activity per day to their baseline level; this group also had a significantly lower rate of falls (incident rate ratio 0.74, 95% CI = 0.55 to 0.99, P = 0.042). Balance confidence was significantly improved in both intervention arms. The mean cost per extra person achieving the physical activity target was £1740. Attrition and rates of adverse reactions were similar. Conclusion The FaME programme increases self-reported physical activity for at least 12 months postintervention and reduces falls in people aged ≥65 years, but uptake is low.

You are an expert in clinical trial design and are tasked to assess the PRECIS-2 scores of a trial based on the full text of its publication. You have the following briefing:
---
# PRECIS-2 Domains
* Eligibility: To what extent are the participants in the trial similar to those who would receive this intervention if it was part of usual care? For example, score 5 for very pragmatic criteria essentially identical to those in usual care; score 1 for a very explanatory approach with lots of exclusions (e.g. those who don’t comply, respond to treatment, or are not at high risk for primary outcome, are children or elderly), or uses many selection tests not used in usual care.
* Recruitment: How much extra effort is made to recruit participants over and above what that would be used in the usual care setting to engage with patients? For example, score 5 for very pragmatic recruitment through usual appointments or clinic; score 1 for a very explanatory approach with targeted invitation letters, advertising in newspapers, radio plus incentives and other routes that would not be used in usual care.
* Setting: How different is the setting of the trial and the usual care setting? For example, score 5 for a very pragmatic choice using identical settings to usual care; score 1, for a very explanatory approach with only a single centre, or only specialised trial or academic centres.
* Organisation: How different are the resources, provider expertise and the organisation of care delivery in the intervention arm of the trial and those available in usual care? For example, score 5 for a very pragmatic choice that uses identical organisation to usual care; score 1 for a very explanatory approach if the trial increases staff levels, gives additional training, require more than usual experience or certification and increase resources.
* Flexibility (delivery): How different is the flexibility in how the intervention is delivered and the flexibility likely in usual care? For example, score 5 for a very pragmatic choice with identical flexibility to usual care; score 1 for a very explanatory approach if there is a strict protocol, monitoring and measures to improve compliance, with specific advice on allowed co-interventions and complications.
* Flexibility (adherence): How different is the flexibility in how participants must adhere to the intervention and the flexibility likely in usual care? For example, score 5 for a very pragmatic choice involving no more than usual encouragement to adhere to the intervention; score 1 for a very explanatory approach that involves exclusion based on adherence, and measures to improve adherence if found wanting. In some trials eg surgical trials where patients are being operated on or Intensive Care Unit trials where patients are being given IV drug therapy, this domain is not applicable as there is no compliance issue after consent has been given, so this score should be left blank.
* Follow-up: How different is the intensity of measurement and follow-up of participants in the trial and the likely follow-up in usual care? For example, score 5 for a very pragmatic approach with no more than usual follow up; score 1 for a very explanatory approach with more frequent, longer visits, unscheduled visits triggered by primary outcome event or intervening event, and more extensive data collection.
* Primary outcome: To what extent is the trial's primary outcome relevant to participants? For example, score 5 for a very pragmatic choice where the outcome is of obvious importance to participants; score 1 for a very explanatory approach using a surrogate, physiological outcome, central adjudication or use assessment expertise that is not available in usual care, or the outcome is measured at an earlier time than in usual care.
* Primary analysis: To what extent are all data included in the analysis of the primary outcome? For example, score 5 for a very pragmatic approach using intention to treat with all available data; score 1 for a very explanatory analysis that excludes ineligible post-randomisation participants, includes only completers or those following the treatment protocol.
