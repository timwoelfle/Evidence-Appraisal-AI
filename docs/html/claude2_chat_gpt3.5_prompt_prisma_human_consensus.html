The abstract mentions that a systematic review was performed.

[Yes] <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The evolution of surgical techniques for dealing with this complex group of malformations led to the description of the PSARP by deVries and Pena [18] in 1982. Despite the excellent exposure of anatomy and exact placement of the distal rectum within the muscle complex, the technique is not perfect, especially in patients with “high” ARM defects [19], [20], [21].&quot;</span>
The introduction describes the rationale for the review.

[No] No explicit statement of review questions or PICOS provided.

[No] No mention of a review protocol.

[Yes] <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Inclusion criteria were studies of ARMs, regardless of level of the defect, with or without associated anomalies, use of LAARP as a primary procedure or with colostomy, and studies reported after the year 2000. Exclusion criteria included studies that were not reported in English and those that did not deal with human subjects.&quot;</span>
The eligibility criteria are specified.

[Yes] <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;A systematic search of the MEDLINE, PUBMED, and Cochrane databases (June 2000 to April 2008) was conducted. The search terms used were “laparoscopic,” “pull-through,” “anorectal malformation,” and “imperforate anus.” In addition, a manual search of 4 surgical journals from the same period was performed.&quot;</span>
The information sources are described. 

[No] The full search strategy is not presented for any database.

[Yes] <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Only studies published in full were included&quot;</span> [...] <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The studies included 124 patients—96 males (77.4%) and 28 females (22.6%).&quot;</span>

[Yes] <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The main outcome measures were also recorded. Extracted data were tabulated in Revman (R) 4.2 Cocnrane IMS.&quot;</span>
The data items are listed.

[NA] No assessment of risk of bias in individual studies mentioned.

[NA] No meta-analysis performed so summary measures not applicable. 

[NA] No meta-analysis so synthesis methods not applicable.

[NA] No assessment of risk of bias across studies mentioned.

[NA] No additional analyses mentioned.

[Yes] <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The initial search in the PUBMED database produced 24 articles, 11 of which met the inclusion criteria. The MEDLINE search resulted in 2 additional new studies, whereas the search of the Cochrane database did not yield any studies. The manual search of the 4 journals captured an additional 1 study from the Journal of Pediatric Surgery and 1 study from Pediatric Surgery International. Two additional articles were found in reference sections of other studies, bringing the total number of studies to 17.&quot;</span>
The study selection process is described.

[Yes] <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The studies included 124 patients—96 males (77.4%) and 28 females (22.6%).&quot;</span> 
Study characteristics are presented.

[NA] No assessment of risk of bias within studies presented.

[NA] No meta-analysis so results of individual studies not presented.

[NA] No meta-analysis performed.

[NA] No assessment of bias across studies.

[NA] No additional analyses performed.

[Yes] <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;When CEQ were compared annually, scores for LAARP were generally higher throughout the study but only statistically significant at 3 and 4 years after surgery. The study concluded that although there were no significant differences between the 2 groups with regard to muscle thickness and parameters of surgical stress observed according to technique, LAARP appeared to provide better outcomes based on CEQ scores.&quot;</span>
A summary of the evidence is provided.

[Yes] <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Our study has several limitations. First, this is a systematic review of mainly retrospective data. The quality of such review is only as good as the included studies. Second, because of the wide variation of reported outcomes, no formal meta-analysis and calculation of summary statistics could be performed. Finally, our review only included articles published in English, which may have contributed to a selection bias by omitting relevant articles published in other languages.&quot;</span>
Limitations are discussed.

[Yes] <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;We conclude that there is an urgent need to increase the number of studies reporting LAARP-related outcomes. More efforts are needed by the pediatric surgery community to improve the quality of studies and standardization of reports related ARM.&quot;</span>
Conclusions and implications are discussed.

[No] No mention of sources of funding for the review.</pre>

P2. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Method/Design: A computerized comprehensive search supplemented by a manual review of the literature was performed for all peer-reviewed publications comparing laparoscopic and open appendectomy, fundoplication and hernia repair cohorts.&quot;</span> [Yes] The abstract provides a structured summary including the methods.

P3. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Although appendicitis is the most frequent cause of emergency abdominal surgery in children, there continue to be significant variations in practice and outcomes [27]. Open appendectomy (OA), first described in the 19th century [1], remained largely unchanged until the introduction of laparoscopic appendectomy (LA) in 1983.&quot;</span> [Yes] The introduction describes the rationale for the review.  

P4. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;In order to evaluate the clinical and cost-effectiveness of this surgical approach a number of outcome measures for laparoscopic and open techniques were analyzed in a comparative fashion.

P24. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;It is generally believed that laparoscopy results in less postoperative pain, fewer complications, and shorter recovery periods compared with open procedures. Yet despite these clearly established benefits in adult populations, at present, data from large prospective series on the safety and efficacy of the laparoscopic technique in younger infants is still lacking, although preliminary data provides convincing evidence that the technique is very promising.&quot;</span> [Yes] The evidence is summarized and considered in context.

P25. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Many of the included studies failed to take all the steps necessary to avoid bias. There may well be an inherent bias in the analyses, which are likely to favor the ‘newer’ MIS/laparoscopic technique.&quot;</span> [Yes] Limitations at the study and outcome level are discussed.

P26. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;This review strengthens the use of MIS in pediatric populations, demonstrating that the three laparoscopic procedures reviewed showed better patient outcomes compared to open procedures in the form of reduced LOS and complication rates.&quot;</span> [Yes] Conclusions are provided considering the results and limitations.

The title identifies the report as a systematic review.

[Yes] <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;We systematically reviewed the literature published during the last 20 years on the treatment of primary proximal hypospadias associated with severe ventral curvature.&quot;</span> 

The abstract provides a structured summary including the background, objectives, eligibility criteria, and conclusions.

[Yes] <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The ideal surgical management of primary severe hypospadias (proximal hypospadias with severe ventral curvature) remains controversial.&quot;</span>

The introduction describes the rationale for the review in the context of what is already known. 

[Yes] <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The aim of the present review was to assess the results of studies published during the last 20 years on the primary repair of severe hypospadias.&quot;</span>

The introduction provides explicit objectives addressing interventions and outcomes.

[No]

The methods do not indicate if a review protocol exists.

[Yes] <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;We included in this review only series containing detailed results after primary repair of severe hypospadias or after curvature correction in patients with primary severe hypospadias.&quot;</span>

The methods specify eligibility criteria regarding study characteristics and outcomes.

[Yes] <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Four databases, MEDLINE/PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science and the Cochrane Library, were searched using a single term, “hypospadias,” as it defines accurately the subject of this review.&quot;</span>

The methods describe the information sources searched and date last searched.

[No] 

The methods do not present the full electronic search strategy for any database. 

[Yes] <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Duplicated publications and congress abstracts were excluded.&quot;</span>

The methods state the process for study screening and selection.

[No]

The methods do not describe the process for data collection from reports.

[Yes] <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;We first reviewed the results of the different straightening procedures, then the crude complication rates (overall complication, fistula/dehiscence, stricture/stenosis rates) of the different urethroplasty techniques.&quot;</span>

The methods list the variables for which data were sought.

[Yes] <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The 2-stage repair, with a 22% cumulative complication rate, a 10% fistula/dehiscence rate and a 6% stricture/stenosis rate, appears to give a distinct clinical benefit overall.&quot;</span>

The results present characteristics of included studies. 

[NA]

Risk of bias assessment is not applicable as no meta-analysis was performed.

[Yes] <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;From the cumulative data outlined in the table, it appears that free graft urethroplasty is the most morbid procedure, mainly due to the tendency for strictures/stenoses to develop.&quot;</span>

The results present summary data and effect estimates for each study.

[NA] 

Synthesis of results is not applicable as no meta-analysis was performed.

[NA]

Assessment of risk of bias across studies is not applicable as no meta-analysis was performed.

[NA]

Additional analyses are not applicable as no meta-analysis was performed.

[Yes] <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The present review illustrates that there is an extreme paucity of studies to address in an evidence-based manner many of the common issues related to the primary repair of proximal hypospadias.&quot;</span>

The discussion summarizes the main findings and considers their relevance.

[Yes] <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;An important limitation is that this review did not account for some variables such as age at surgery, use of additional coverage of urethroplasty, and type of preoperative and postoperative drainage and care.&quot;</span> 

The discussion describes limitations at the study and outcome level.

[Yes] <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Hence, while we elaborate on general recommendations for the treatment of this condition, we emphasize the need to establish shared criteria for accurate preoperative or introperative patient stratification, and to define objective outcome measures and followup intervals for data reporting to make comparison of surgical approaches reliable.&quot;</span>

The discussion provides conclusions and implications for future research.

[No]

[Yes] <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Does Preputial Reconstruction Increase Complication Rate of Hypospadias Repair? 20-Year Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis&quot;</span>
The title identifies the report as a systematic review and meta-analysis.

[Yes] <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;We performed a systematic review of the literature on preputial reconstruction (PR) during hypospadias repair to determine the cumulative risk of preputial skin complications and the influence of PR on urethroplasty complications, namely, fistula formation and overall reoperation rate of the repair.&quot;</span>
The abstract provides a structured summary including background, objectives, eligibility criteria, outcomes, and conclusions.

[Yes] <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Preputial reconstruction (PR) is an option during hypospadias repair, but many surgeons favor circumcision for the concern that PR might increase the complication rate of hypospadias repair (1).&quot;</span> 
The introduction describes the rationale for the review in context of existing knowledge.

[Yes] <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Moreover, we performed a meta-analysis of studies comparing urethroplasty complications and reoperation rates in patients undergoing hypospadias repair associated with PR vs. circumcision to test the hypothesis that circumcision is associated with a lower rate of complications related to the urethroplasty, namely, fistula rate, and a lower reoperation rate.&quot;</span>
The introduction states the objectives and specifies the participants, interventions, comparisons, and outcomes. 

[No]
No protocol or registration is indicated.

[Yes] <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;In the review, we included only studies reporting data on complications of PR (dehiscence of reconstructed prepuce and phimosis), on urethroplasty complications (fistula formation), and on reoperation rates in patients undergoing hypospadias repair with preservation of the prepuce.&quot;</span>
Study characteristics used as eligibility criteria are specified.

[Yes] <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Three databases, namely, MEDLINE/PubMed, Scopus, and The Cochrane library, were searched for using the free text “hypospadias repair,” in all fields of the records for MEDLINE/PubMed search, and in the Title and Topic fields for the Web of Science and Cochrane library searches.&quot;</span>
The information sources searched are described including databases, search terms, and date ranges.

[Yes] “For MEDLINE/PubMed search, “English,” “Humans,” “Males,” and “Publication date from June 1995 to June 2015” were considered, as limits."
The full search strategy for one database is provided including limits used.

[Yes] <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Three doctors reviewed separately the abstracts. Papers relevant to the topic of the review were selected by consensus.&quot;</span> 
The study selection process is described.

[No]
The data collection process is not described.

[Yes] <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;For data extraction, dehiscence was considered irrespective of whether partial or complete. Since many reconstructed prepuces are non-retractile soon after surgery, but retractility can spontaneously improve over time, secondary phimosis was defined as a phimosis needing circumcision during follow-up.&quot;</span>
The variables extracted are listed and defined. 

[NA]
Risk of bias assessment is not applicable for this review without meta-analysis.

[Yes] <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Two different outcomes were used for the meta-analysis, namely, “hypospadias fistula formation” and “overall reoperation rate.”&quot;</span>
The principal summary measures are stated.

[NA] 
Synthesis methods are not applicable for this review without meta-analysis.

[NA]
Assessment of bias across studies is not applicable without meta-analysis.

[NA]
Additional analyses are not applicable without meta-analysis.

[Yes] <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Of the original 3692 records, 20 (0.6%) studies that matched the criteria for inclusion in the review were finally selected (Figure 1).&quot;</span>
The number of studies screened, assessed, and included is provided with exclusions specified.

[Yes] <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Characteristics of included studies are detailed in Table 1. The vast majority (13, 65%) were surgical series (LOE 4), three (15%) were retrospective case–control studies (LOE 4), two (10%) were longitudinal cohort studies (LOE 3), and the remaining two (10%) were RCTs (LOE 2).&quot;</span> 
For each study, characteristics are presented including design, level of evidence, and citation.

[No]
No outcome level risk of bias assessment is presented. 

[Yes] <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;In the 19 studies (Table 2), the PR complication rate ranged 0 to 30%, but was <10% in 15. The cumulative rate of PR complications was 7.7% (163 of 2115 patients).&quot;</span>
Summary data and effect estimates are presented for relevant outcomes.

[NA] 
Synthesis methods are not applicable without meta-analysis. 

[NA]
Assessment of bias across studies is not applicable without meta-analysis.

[NA]
Additional analyses are not applicable without meta-analysis.

[Yes] <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;This systematic review shows that according to available evidence PR carries an 8% risk of specific complications, whereas it does not seem to increase the risk of urethroplasty complications and the overall reoperation rate of hypospadias repairs.&quot;</span>
The main findings are summarized including strength of evidence for main outcomes. 

[Yes] <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Although this review encompasses the best available evidence, some drawbacks should be considered. Results of systematic reviews are unavoidably dependent on the criteria chosen to select the studies and the quality of the studies included.&quot;</span>
Limitations at the study and outcome level are discussed.

[Yes] <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Preputial reconstruction is an option particularly in patients with distal hypospadias without associated penile curvature. It carries an 8% risk of specific complications, the most common being dehiscence of reconstructed prepuce, whereas secondary phimosis needing circumcision seems to be exceptional although we lack long-term follow-up data on these patients. Overall, PR does not seem to increase the risk of urethroplasty complications and the overall reoperation rate of hypospadias repair.&quot;</span>
Conclusions are provided considering other evidence and implications for future research.

[Yes] <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Conflict of Interest Statement: The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest.&quot;</span>

P25. [Yes] <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Our results should be interpreted with caution due to limitations of our study. The most direct measurement of male fertility is paternity rate and time until conception of a live born child [4]; however, due to the difficulty in conducting long-term paternity studies, most research has measured fertility using testicular growth/size [11, 14, 16, 28, 31, 33–35], testicular histology at orchiopexy [15, 17, 23, 26, 27, 32, 36, 41], and semen analysis in adulthood [11, 25, 29–32, 35, 37, 38, 40, 41].&quot;</span>

By disseminating our findings, we hope to bring awareness of this topic to pediatric surgeons and other medical practitioners, promoting the worldwide use of evidence-based medicine.&quot;</span>

[Yes] <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Transanal endorectal pull-through versus transabdominal approach for Hirschsprung's disease: A systematic review and meta-analysis&quot;</span>
The title identifies the report as a systematic review and meta-analysis.

[Yes] <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;We performed a comprehensive meta-analysis comparing the clinical outcomes of TERPT and TAB.&quot;</span>  
The abstract provides a structured summary including the objectives, data sources, eligibility criteria, participants, interventions, study appraisal and synthesis methods, results, limitations, and conclusions.

[Yes] <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;As such, TERPT has become an increasingly popular approach for treating HD [11].&quot;</span>
The introduction describes the rationale for the review in context of what is already known.  

[Yes] <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;However, the long-term outcome of TERPT is less clear.&quot;</span>
The introduction states the question being addressed is comparing long-term outcomes of TERPT and TAB.

[NA]
No review protocol or registration is mentioned.

[Yes] <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Original articles published from 1998 to 2012 were searched from Medline, Embase, and Cochrane databases. Randomized controlled trials (RCT) and observational clinical studies (OCS) comparing TERPT and TAB were included.&quot;</span>
The eligibility criteria regarding study characteristics and report characteristics are described.

[Yes] <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;We searched all publications from August 1998 to March 2012 in the MEDLINE, EMBASE and Cochrane library databases and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register using different combinations of the following terms: “Hirschsprung's disease,” “transanal,” “perineal approach,” “transabdominal” and “pull-through.”&quot;</span> 
The information sources including databases and dates of coverage are described.

[No]
The full search strategy is not presented.

[Yes] <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Each included study was independently appraised by 3 reviewers (C.Y., S.N., N.K.L.) and data were extracted and entered into a database.&quot;</span>
The study selection process is described.

The data collection process is described.

[Yes] <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The following data were evaluated: patient's age at operation, length of aganglionic segment, operative time, length of hospital stay, duration of follow-up and the incidence of postoperative incontinence, constipation and enterocolitis.&quot;</span>
The variables extracted are listed.

[NA] 
No assessment of risk of bias in individual studies is described since this is a systematic review without a meta-analysis.

[NA]
No summary measures are stated since this is a systematic review without a meta-analysis. 

[NA]  
No synthesis methods are described since this is a systematic review without a meta-analysis.

[NA]
No assessment of bias across studies is described since this is a systematic review without a meta-analysis.

[Yes] <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;TERPT is superior to TAB in operative time, hospital stay, postoperative incontinence and constipation.&quot;</span>
The main findings are summarized including the strength of evidence.

[Yes] <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;However, the lack of large prospective studies of robust design cannot be trivialized.&quot;</span>
Limitations at the study and outcome level are discussed.

[Yes] <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;More randomized controlled trials are necessary to verify the benefit of TERPT for Hirschsprung's disease.&quot;</span>  
Conclusions are provided and implications for future research are discussed.

[Yes] <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The authors would like to thank Mr. Fahad Javaid Siddiqui, Assistant Professor of Epidemiology, Singapore Clinical Research Institute, for his invaluable help with statistical analysis.&quot;</span>

Here are the relevant quotes and explanations for each PRISMA item:

The article is titled <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Is Screening of Intestinal Foregut Anatomy in Heterotaxy Patients Really Necessary? A Systematic Review in Search of the Evidence&quot;</span> which identifies it as a systematic review. [Yes]

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;A systematic review [according to PRISMA guidelines] was conducted using CINAHL, EMBASE, Medline, and Cochrane Databases.&quot;</span> The methods section states it is a systematic review and provides information on the sources searched. [Yes] 

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;In light of uncertainty and controversy, we undertook a systematic review of the available literature to determine (1) whether screening of IRA is obligatory in “asymptomatic” patients with heterotaxy and (2) whether detection of a rotational anomaly warrant(s) surgical correction in such a fragile patient cohort.&quot;</span> The introduction states the rationale and objectives of the review. [Yes]

<span title='Moderate quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 94.7%):

. We hypothesized that the complication(s) associated with surgical correction outweighed the risk of midgut volvulus and its sequelae and that screening in “asymptomatic patients” was unnecessary.' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ff9e81'>&quot;To this end, we hypothesized that the complication(s) associated with surgical correction outweighed the risk of midgut volvulus and its sequelae and that screening in “asymptomatic patients” was unnecessary.&quot;</span> The introduction provides the PICOS elements being examined. [Yes]

No protocol or registration is mentioned. [No] 

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Eligibility criteria were then applied to remaining studies (Table 1).&quot;</span> Eligibility criteria for studies are provided. [Yes]

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;A systematic search of the English language literature was conducted using a keyword algorithm (Supplemental Figure 1, https://links.lww.com/SLA/A928). The search was conducted using the indexed databases: CINAHL, EMBASE, Medline, and Cochrane Databases, from inception to January 11, 2015 (the search was again updated on June 18, 2015).&quot;</span> The information sources and dates searched are described. [Yes]  

No full search strategy is provided. [No]

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Two reviewers (P.S.C., S.S.) performed the study selection, data extraction, and quality assessment processes independently and all data was recorded in tabular form electronically. Disagreements were resolved by discussion or consultation with the third reviewer/senior corresponding author who conceived the study (P.D.L.).&quot;</span> The study selection process is described. [Yes]

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The primary outcome evaluated was mortality associated with conservative or surgical management of IRA. Secondary outcomes included development of malrotation with obstruction or midgut volvulus, that is, symptomatic IRA and complications thereof with surgical intervention.&quot;</span> The data collection process is described. [Yes] 

The outcomes sought are listed in the data extraction section. [Yes] 

No assessment of risk of bias in individual studies is described. [No]

No summary measures are stated. [NA] 

No synthesis methods are described. [NA]

No assessment of risk of bias across studies is described. [NA] 

No additional analyses are described. [NA]

No flow diagram of study selection is provided. [No]

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Table 2 summarizes the main characteristics of the 19 included studies.&quot;</span> Study characteristics are presented. [Yes]

No assessment of risk of bias within studies is presented. [No] 

No results for individual studies are presented. [No]

No synthesis results are presented. [NA]

No assessment of risk of bias across studies is presented. [NA]

No additional analyses results are presented. [NA] 

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;This systematic review shows that “asymptomatic patients” with heterotaxy are at a low risk of developing IRA-related complications.&quot;</span> The review's main findings are summarized. [Yes]

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;We fully acknowledge that there are some limitations with the present study.&quot;</span> Limitations are discussed. [Yes]

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Although this systematic review favors a “watchful waiting” approach over prophylactic surgery in patients with heterotaxy, what exactly this should constitute is not standardized.&quot;</span> Conclusions and implications are provided. [Yes]

No funding sources are described. [No]</pre>

The title identifies the report as a systematic review.

[Yes] The abstract provides a structured summary including background, objectives, data sources, eligibility criteria, participants, interventions, study appraisal and synthesis methods, results, limitations, and conclusions.
It has a structured abstract.

[Yes] <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The incidence of an inguinal hernia in children less than 18 years of age ranges from 0.8% to 4.4%.1 Eighty-five percent of patients with an inguinal hernia present with a unilateral hernia.1 The incidence of incarceration in the unrepaired hernia in infants and young children seems to vary between 6% and 18%, but it increases to approximately 30% in infancy, with a potential risk to the bowel and testicle.2 Bilateral inguinal hernia is significantly more common in younger patients (present in 50% if less than 1 year, 45% if less than 2 years, and 37% if less than 5 years).&quot;</span> 
The introduction describes the rationale and context for the review.

[Yes] <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;This review aims to evaluate the role of LH in children and to compare LH with OH in regard to operative time, postoperative complications, recurrence rate, discovering of rare hernias, and incidence of contralateral patency.&quot;</span>
The introduction states the objectives and PICOS elements. 

[No] The methods do not indicate if a review protocol exists or provide registration information.

[Yes] <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Eligibility criteria included all available studies focused on LH and/or OH and with quantitative data on outcome parameters. The pediatric population was defined as younger than 18 years when the patient underwent LH or OH.&quot;</span>
The eligibility criteria are specified.

[Yes] <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;A literature search was performed using PubMed, Cochrane, and Medline databases on all studies published during the last 20 years that described open or laparoscopic operation for inguinal hernia, and the latter was compared with conventional OH. The following key words were used: “inguinal hernia,” “herniorrhaphy,” “hernia repair,” “children,” “laparoscopic versus open herniorrhaphy,” “laparoscopic versus open hernia repair,” “contralateral patency,” “complications,” and “recurrence.”&quot;</span>
The information sources and search strategy are described.

[No] The full electronic search strategy is not provided for any database. 

[Yes] <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The authors independently assessed selected studies and tabulated data from each article with a predefined data extraction form. Data regarding the following factors were considered: first author, publication date, study method, participant features, intervention characteristics, definition of complications, and outcome measures. Outcome parameters for inclusion were patients' age, gender, affected side, operative time, time to resume full activity, duration of hospital stay, recurrence, metachronic contralateral hernia, and complications.&quot;</span>

The data items extracted are listed. 

[No] The methods used for assessing risk of bias are not described.

[Yes] <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The chi-squared or Fisher's exact test was used to evaluate the significance of differences between the two groups: LH and OH.&quot;</span>
The principal summary measures are stated.

[NA] Synthesis methods are not described as no meta-analysis was performed.

[NA] Assessment of bias across studies is not described as no meta-analysis was performed. 

[NA] No additional analyses are described as no meta-analysis was performed.

[Yes] Figure 1 shows the flow diagram of study selection.

[Yes] Table 1 presents characteristics of the included studies such as sample sizes and operative times.

[No] Individual study risk of bias is not presented.

[Yes] Tables 1 and 2 present operative time and recurrence rate data for individual studies.

[NA] Results of meta-analyses are not presented as no meta-analysis was performed. 

[NA] Results of bias assessment across studies are not presented as no meta-analysis was performed.

[NA] Results of additional analyses are not presented as no meta-analysis was performed. 

[Yes] <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;In conclusion, we think that there is no evidence in the literature about which technique (laparoscopy or inguinal approach) is preferable to repair an inguinal hernia. Probably a surgeon has to offer to the patient both techniques, and above all, considering the importance of the parental role in the decision process, the parents have to know that two different approaches exist to repair an inguinal hernia and the advantages and disadvantages of both procedures.&quot;</span>
The conclusion summarizes the main findings and implications.

[Yes] <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;However, the length of follow-up in reviewed series was less for the laparoscopic approach compared with the open operation (2.3 versus 4.2 years, respectively).&quot;</span>
Limitations at the study and outcome level are discussed.

[Yes] <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;In summary, LH appears faster for bilateral hernia repair when compared with the inguinal crease approach. Recurrence rates appear similar, but the follow-up is less in the LH studies. Wound infection appears more likely after OH, but the incidence is small. Time to resume normal activity is similar with both approaches. Further perspective investigation, including long-term follow-up, will be needed to accurately identify the optimal approach for inguinal hernia repair in infants and children.&quot;</span>
The conclusion provides an interpretation of the results and implications for future research.

[Yes] <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;No competing financial interests exist.&quot;</span>

Here are the relevant quotes and assessments for each PRISMA item:

P1. "[Yes]" 
"Open Versus Laparoscopic Inguinal Herniotomy in Children
A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis Focusing on Postoperative Complications"
The title identifies the report as a systematic review and meta-analysis.

P2. "[Yes]"
<span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Abstract: Provide a structured summary including, as applicable: background; objectives; data sources; study eligibility criteria, participants, and interventions; study appraisal and synthesis methods; results; limitations; conclusions and implications of key findings; systematic review registration number.&quot;</span> 
The abstract provides a structured summary.

P3. "[Yes]" 
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;As one of the most frequently performed surgical procedures in infants and children, herniotomy is the standard procedure for pediatric inguinal hernia (PIH) because of its high success rate and low rate of complications.&quot;</span>
The introduction describes the rationale in context of existing knowledge.

P4. "[Yes]"  
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The aim of this study was to compare both of the surgical strategies as regards operative time, recurrence rate, postoperative complications by means of a systematic review, and meta-analysis of the available literatures.&quot;</span>
The objectives explicitly state the questions being addressed. 

P5. "[No]"
No protocol or registration is mentioned.

P6. "[Yes]"
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Eligibility criteria included total available studies comparing LH with OH for the repair of PIH. The children were younger than 18 years when they underwent LH or OH.&quot;</span> 
The eligibility criteria are specified.

P7. "[Yes]"
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;We systematically searched PubMed for relevant studies reported from 2005 to 2014 with the keywords “laparoscopic herniorrhaphy”, “pediatric inguinal hernia,” and “open herniorrhaphy.” Total reference lists of selected articles were also included.&quot;</span>
The information sources are described.

P8. "[No]" 
No search strategy is presented.

P9. "[Yes]" 
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Two reviewers (S.F., Z.L.) screened the citation identified by the search strategy.&quot;</span> 
The study selection process is described.

P10. "[No]"
The data collection process is not described. 

P11. "[Yes]"
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Details of publication (type of repairing the internal ring, trocars, and follow-up duration), inclusion and exclusion criteria, and demographics of the enrolled patients were collected and collated.&quot;</span>
The data items are listed.

P12. "[No]"
No assessment of risk of bias is described.

P13. "[Yes]"
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Weighted mean differences and odds ratios were used for the analysis of continuous and dichotomous variables, respectively.&quot;</span>
The summary measures are stated.

P14. "[NA]" 
Not applicable since no meta-analysis was performed.

P15. "[NA]"
Not applicable since no assessment of bias across studies was done. 

P16. "[NA]" 
Not applicable since no additional analyses were done.

P17. "[Yes]"
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Five trials met the total inclusion criteria and had no exclusion criteria (Fig. 1): Chan et al,28 Koivusalo et al,29 Celebi et al,30 Shalaby et al,31 and Saranga et al.32&quot;</span>
The number of studies screened, assessed, and included is provided. 

P18. "[Yes]" 
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The 5 selected trials included 553 participants. Two hundred and seventy-eight patients received OH and 275 received LH. Study details and the quality check of total RCTs are given in Tables 1 and 2, respectively.&quot;</span>
Study characteristics are presented.

P19. "[No]"
No assessment of risk of bias within studies is presented.

P20. "[Yes]" 
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Three of the 5 trials reported the operative time for children treated with unilateral laparoscopic and open inguinal herniotomy. The pooled data showed that there was no significant difference in operative time for children treated with unilateral hernias between laparoscopic and open group with unacceptably statistical heterogeneity(I2=94%) (95% CI, −9.08 to 5.50; with 119 in the laparoscopic and 123 in the open group; Fig. 2A).&quot;</span> 
Results for each study are presented.

P21. "[NA]"
Not applicable since no meta-analysis was performed.

P22. "[NA]"  
Not applicable since no assessment of bias across studies was done.

P23. "[NA]"
Not applicable since no additional analyses were done. 

P24. "[Yes]"
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Our results show that LH is superior for the inguinal hernia repair in children, with shorter operative time for unilateral hernias in extraperitoneal approaches group as well as for bilateral hernias. Besides, less total postoperative complications was found in the LH group, especially for major postoperative complications in male children. Yet there is no significant difference regarding recurrences.&quot;</span>
A summary of the evidence is provided.

P25. "[Yes]"  
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;However, on one hand, because of the limited number of patients and studies, more RCTs need to be conducted to confirm these findings; on the other hand, the learning curve in the 5 RCTs may play an underestimated role in the study, which may weaken the results of the comparison.&quot;</span>
Limitations are discussed.

P26. "[Yes]"
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Our results show that LH is superior for the inguinal hernia repair in children, with shorter operative time for unilateral hernias in extraperitoneal approaches group as well as for bilateral hernias. Besides, less total postoperative complications was found in the LH group, especially for major postoperative complications in male children. Yet there is no significant difference regarding recurrences.&quot;</span>

It may also be argued that the initial prolonged hospitalization is expensive. These factors must be balanced against reduced long-term morbidity in a child who should have a normal life expectancy and against the disadvantages of esophageal replacement.&quot;</span>
Limitations are discussed.

In summary, the article reports 18 out of 27 PRISMA items. The key missing elements are a review protocol, assessment of risk of bias, funding, and details on some meta-analysis items that were not applicable. Overall, the systematic review has several deficiencies in reporting based on PRISMA, but provides a helpful quantitative synthesis of DPA outcomes in LGEA patients.</pre>

On the long-term, GPU seems to be associated with a higher respiratory morbidity but fewer gastrointestinal complications than CI.

The discussion summarizes the main findings and considers their relevance.

[Yes] <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;However, due to the publishing bias, a series of RCTs are still necessary to explore the efficiencies of LO in the management of NPT in children, especially in the true outcome of orchidopexy and fertility in adulthood.&quot;</span>
The limitations at the study and outcome level are discussed.

[Yes] <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Conclusions: In this meta-analysis, we demonstrate that the operative time, time to resume feeding and full activity is similar between LO and OO.&quot;</span>

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Open versus Laparoscopic Pyloromyotomy for Pyloric Stenosis: A Meta-analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials&quot;</span>
The title identifies the report as a systematic review and meta-analysis.

[Yes]  
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Objective: Aim of the study was to compare the outcomes after laparoscopic pyloromyotomy (LP) with those of open pyloromyotomy (OP) for infantile pyloric stenosis.&quot;</span>
The abstract provides a structured summary including the objectives.

[Yes]
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Pyloromyotomy is an effective surgical intervention with rare mortality and has traditionally been performed via an open technique since the early 20th century.&quot;</span>  
The introduction describes the rationale for the review.

[Yes]
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Given the conflicting evidence of prior studies, the aim of this meta-analysis was to systematically and quantitatively evaluate all the published randomized controlled trials comparing LP with OP for infantile pyloric stenosis.&quot;</span>
The introduction states the objective and specifies the intervention comparison being addressed. 

[No]
No protocol or registration is indicated.

[Yes] 
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Eligible studies were those that compared LP with OP for the treatment of infants with IHPS, and only randomized controlled trials was reviewed. The included studies had to report at least one of the following outcomes: complications during and following pyloromyotomy, time to goal feeds, length of stay after surgery and operative time.&quot;</span>
The eligibility criteria are specified.

[Yes]  
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;An electronic literature search of all articles from inception to February 2009 was conducted using Medline, the Cochrane Library, SCI, EMBASE, and the Chinese Biomedical Literature Database, using the following text and keywords in combination both as MeSH terms and text words: “pyloric stenosis”, “pylorostenosis”, “pyloristenosis” and “pyloromyotomy” in combination with “laparoscop*”. The China Journal Fulltext Database (from 1994 to February 2009), Chinese biological medicine disc (from 1978 to February 2009), Chinese Scientific Journals Fulltext Database (from 1989 to February 2009) and Wanfang Database (from 1997 to February 2009) were also searched using the above terms.&quot;</span>

The full search strategy is presented.

[Yes]
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The literature searches yielded 461 potentially relevant articles. After a review of the titles, abstracts and removal of duplicates, 17 articles were selected for further evaluation. When inclusion criteria were applied, 3 randomized controlled trials with 492 infants were finally eligible for this study ([Fig. 1]).&quot;</span> 
The study selection process is described.

[Yes]  
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Data were extracted by 2 independent investigators, and discrepancies were discussed to reach consensus.

The main findings are summarized.

[Yes] 
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;As with any systematic review, the limitations of this study reflect those of the individual studies. Most relied on information from databases. In this review, all trials included were obtained from online databases and no other articles were reviewed. Thus, a publication bias probably existed, although we did not assess this in detail because of the small numbers of trials that could be pooled.&quot;</span>
Study and outcome level limitations are discussed.

[Yes] <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Surgical versus conservative management of congenital pulmonary airway malformation in children: A systematic review and meta-analysis&quot;</span>
The title identifies the report as a systematic review and meta-analysis.

[Yes] <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis comparing elective resection versus expectant management.&quot;</span>  
The abstract provides a structured summary including the objectives, data sources, eligibility criteria, methods, results, and conclusions.

[Yes] <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The ideal management of infants born with asymptomatic congenital pulmonary airway malformation (CPAM) is controversial.&quot;</span>
The introduction describes the rationale for the review in context of existing knowledge.  

[Yes] <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Our objective was to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of all published literature comparing the postoperative outcomes associated with elective surgery (while asymptomatic) versus those following surgery as part of expectant management (i.e., performing surgery only upon the development of symptoms) in children born with asymptomatic CPAM lesions.&quot;</span>
The introduction provides explicit objectives with reference to participants, interventions, comparisons, and outcomes.

[NA] 
No statement about existence of a review protocol.

[Yes] <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;We excluded any studies on nonhuman subjects and those that did not focus on pediatric patients, as well as any studies that were not published in English, owing to resource limitations.&quot;</span>
Study characteristics used as eligibility criteria are specified.

[Yes] <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;To identify all studies on elective surgery and expectant management of asymptomatic CPAM lesions, we conducted an electronic literature search of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (1966 onwards), EMBASE (1980 onwards), CINAHL (1982 onwards), and PubMed (1966 onwards) in January 2015.&quot;</span> 
Information sources including databases and dates searched are described. 

[Yes] <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;We used the search terms (“asymptomatic” AND “congenital” AND “cystic” AND “adenomatoid malformation”) OR (“lung” AND “lesion”) AND (“management” OR “treatment” OR “therapy.”).&quot;</span>
The full search strategy for one database is presented.

[Yes] <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Two independent reviewers conducted all article screening; where consensus on an article could not be reached, a third reviewer was consulted.&quot;</span>  
The process of study selection including screening and eligibility is described.

[Yes] <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;One reviewer extracted all data from the included studies, and another checked it for accuracy and completeness. We extracted the following data exclusively on patients who were asymptomatic at birth: number of patients undergoing elective surgery, number undergoing surgery as part of expectant management (after symptom development), age at symptom development if applicable, postoperative complications, mortalities, and total length of postoperative hospital stay, as well as number of patients successfully managed conservatively at the end of follow-up, and length of follow-up for these patients.&quot;</span>
The data collection process including data extraction is described. 

[Yes] <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;We extracted the following data exclusively on patients who were asymptomatic at birth: number of patients undergoing elective surgery, number undergoing surgery as part of expectant management (after symptom development), age at symptom development if applicable, postoperative complications, mortalities, and total length of postoperative hospital stay, as well as number of patients successfully managed conservatively at the end of follow-up, and length of follow-up for these patients.&quot;</span>
Variables extracted are listed.

[Yes] <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;We used the Methodological Index for Non-Randomized Studies (MINORS) to assess the quality of the included studies, as all were nonrandomized [18].&quot;</span>
Methods for assessing risk of bias are described.

[NA] 
No summary measures stated as no meta-analysis performed.

[NA]
No methods described for combining study results as no meta-analysis performed. 

[NA]  
No assessment of risk of bias across studies described.

[NA]
No additional analyses described.

[Yes] <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Full-text review resulted in eight of these studies being included, while an additional one was identified from hand-searching the reference sections of included articles; nine studies were ultimately included [10], [11], [12], [14], [23], [24], [25], [26], [27]].&quot;</span>
Numbers of studies screened, assessed, and included are provided with reasons for exclusion.

[Yes] <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;We did not identify any RCTs; all but one of the included nine studies were retrospective [26]. Studies were published between 1996 and 2011 and were conducted in Australia [14], [27], Belgium [25], Canada [23], China [24], Israel [26], Italy [10], Japan [12], and the United States of America [11].&quot;</span>
Study characteristics are presented.

[Yes] <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The MINORS scores for our included studies ranged from 7 to 14, with a median score of 9 (Table 1).&quot;</span>
Data on risk of bias assessment is presented.

[NA] 
No results of individual studies presented as no meta-analysis performed.

[NA] 
No results of meta-analyses presented as none performed. 

[NA]
No assessment of bias across studies presented.

[NA]
No results of additional analyses presented.

[Yes] <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Based on our results, we recommend elective resection of asymptomatic CPAM lesions, rather than expectant management. Lung resection in an asymptomatic patient is quite safe, prevents the risk of symptom development later in life, and may help prevent the development of malignancy.&quot;</span>  
A summary of the main findings and their relevance is provided.

[Yes]  <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Our results should be interpreted with caution owing to the nature of the included studies (in that all but one were retrospective). We did not identify any RCTs evaluating the benefit of elective surgery compared to expectant management of asymptomatic CPAM lesions.&quot;</span>
Limitations at the study and outcome level are discussed.

[Yes] <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Based on our results, we recommend elective resection of asymptomatic CPAM lesions, rather than expectant management. Lung resection in an asymptomatic patient is quite safe, prevents the risk of symptom development later in life, and may help prevent the development of malignancy. The ideal timing of elective resection will be the topic of a future review.&quot;</span>
Conclusions are provided with implications for future research.

Provides background and objectives in the abstract.

[Yes] <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Circumcision can be undertaken using a variety of techniques. For the technique to be successful, it should be easy to perform, avoid excessive haemorrhage and achieve a good cosmetic and functional result with minimal postoperative care. Naturally, there are differences between circumcision in the paediatric and adult populations and here we review the literature on recent advances that have been made in paediatric circumcision and the use of a sutureless technique with tissue glue for wound approximation.&quot;</span>

Summarizes main findings.

[Yes] <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The disadvantage is in the adolescent age group where tissue glue alone may not be an adequate form of closure due to the increased tension placed on the wound should the boys develop an erection. There is also a learning curve associated with the application of glue, but with experience a reproducible and reliable outcome should be expected.&quot;</span>

P24. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;This meta-analysis of methodologically limited comparative studies indicates neonatal thoracoscopic CDH repair has increased recurrence risk and operative time compared with open repair: although survival and patch usage appear comparable, such similarities may be subject to type 2 error as well as biases.&quot;</span>
A summary of the evidence is provided. [Yes]

P25. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;However, these findings need to be considered in the context of the methodological limitations of the studies available for inclusion; for each outcome measure, we will discuss the potential for bias and other confounding factors.&quot;</span>
Study limitations are discussed. [Yes] 

P26. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Better quality evidence is therefore required. Systematic reviews and meta-analyses frequently conclude with calls for more randomized controlled trials (RCTs). In contrast, we call for prospective, comprehensive, multi-institutional registry data on neonatal endosurgical CDH repair.&quot;</span>
Conclusions and implications are discussed. [Yes]

P27. No funding sources reported. [No]</pre>

[Yes] <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Laparoscopic portoenterostomy versus open portoenterostomy for the treatment of biliary atresia: a systematic review and meta-analysis of comparative studies&quot;</span>
The title identifies the report as a systematic review and meta-analysis.

[Yes] <span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Background; objectives; data sources; study eligibility criteria, participants, and interventions; study appraisal and synthesis methods; results; limitations; conclusions and implications of key findings; systematic review registration number.&quot;</span>
The abstract provides a structured summary including all applicable elements.

[Yes] <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Biliary atresia (BA) is one of the most common reasons for portoenterostomy in pediatric surgery, which is characterized by progressive inflammatory disease of the hepatobiliary system that occurs in about 1/9,000–1/15,000 neonates [1].&quot;</span> 
The introduction describes the rationale for the review in the context of what is already known about biliary atresia.

[Yes] <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The aim of this study was to include all publicly available data for comparing the safety and validity of laparoscopic portoenterostomy (LPE) and open portoenterostomy (OPE) in the treatment of biliary atresia.&quot;</span>
The objectives provide an explicit statement of the questions being addressed regarding the comparison of LPE and OPE for biliary atresia.

[NA]
No protocol or registration information is provided.

[Yes] <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;For inclusion in this meta-analysis, the studies had to meet the following criteria: (1) be a cohort study comparing laparoscopic technique and open technique in BA patients undergoing portoenterostomy; (2) include at least one interest datum for analysis—hospital stay, operative time, blood loss, complications, early clearance of jaundice, the rate of long-term survival with native liver; (3) clearly document technique as ‘‘laparoscopic’’ or ‘‘open’’; (4) clearly document indications for portoenterostomy with biliary atresia; (5) be published as a full paper in a journal, not as meeting abstract or review.&quot;</span>
The eligibility criteria are specified including study characteristics and reported outcomes.

[Yes] <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;We conducted a systematic search of the online databases, including Medline, Ovid, Elsevier, Google Scholar Embase, Cohrane library, for studies published between 1995 and 2014 with no limits for publication language, place of study origin and sample size of the studies.&quot;</span>
The information sources are described including databases searched and date ranges. 

[No]
The full electronic search strategy is not presented for any database.

[Yes] <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The process of study screening is showed in Fig. 1, through which, eleven studies assessing LPE versus OPE were considered suitable for meta-analysis, including two prospective [21, 22] and nine retrospective [13, 23–30] studies.&quot;</span>
The process of study selection is described.

[Yes] <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Two independent authors (QG and ZZ) using a predefined meta-analysis form extracted relevant data from each study which resulted in high and satisfactory interobserver agreement.&quot;</span> 
The data collection process is described including extraction in duplicate.

[Yes] <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The following data were the outcomes of interest that extracted from each included study: first author, publication year, country, study design, number of patients who underwent LPE or OPE, characteristics of the study population, and end point data (operative times, hospital stay times, rate of conversion from LPE to OPE, re-operation rates, and complications about surgery including: intraoperative blood loss, early clearance of jaundice, cholangitis and variceal bleeding.&quot;</span>
The data items extracted are listed including study details and outcomes.

[Yes] <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The Newcastle Ottawa Scale (NOS), designed specially for observational studies, was adopted to assess the quality of selected studies [15].&quot;</span>
The methods used for assessing risk of bias are described.

[NA]
No meta-analysis was performed, so summary measures are not applicable. 

[NA] 
No meta-analysis was performed, so synthesis methods are not applicable.

[NA]

[Yes] <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The characteristics of these 11 studies are listed in Table 1.&quot;</span>
For each study, characteristics are presented including details like study size and PICOS elements.

[Yes] <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The risk of bias was assessed using the Newcastle–Ottawa scale (NOS) for assessing the quality of included studies and is demonstrated in Table 3.&quot;</span>
Risk of bias is presented for each study.

[NA] 
No meta-analysis was performed, so results for individual studies are not applicable.

[NA]  
No meta-analysis was performed, so pooled results are not applicable. 

[NA]
No assessment of risk of bias across studies is applicable without a meta-analysis.

[NA]
No additional analyses were performed.

[Yes] <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Postoperative complications, functional outcomes and liver survival were the primary parameters for the comparison between LPE and OPE.&quot;</span>
The main findings are summarized including outcomes assessed.

[Yes] <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;First, there have only been a small number of studies comparing LPE with OPE in the treatment of biliary atresia, with a lack of randomized trials.&quot;</span> 
Limitations at the study and outcome level are discussed.

[Yes] <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Based on the evidence, we make cautious conclusions that laparoscopic portoenterostomy could not replace open portoenterostomy and open Kasai operation remains the ‘gold standard’ for the treatment of biliary atresia.&quot;</span>
General conclusions are provided in context of other evidence and implications.

The main findings and strength of evidence are summarized.

[Yes] 
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Although the inclusion of such studies may reduce concerns about publication bias (as the decision to publish was unrelated to the outcome with respect to the surgical procedure) the findings nonetheless highlight the few reports in the neuroblastoma literature that have specifically examined survival outcome metrics following GTR or STR.&quot;</span>

Limitations at the study and outcome level are discussed.

[Yes] 
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;We believe a prospective well-designed randomized trial incorporating patient age, tumor site and elements of tumor biology (MYCN, DNA ploidy status, etc.) is needed to fully address the role of surgery in stage 4 neuroblastoma.&quot;</span>

[Yes] <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The surgical treatment of choice in the last century has been the longitudinal splitting of the seromuscular layer of the pylorus without suturing, which is defined as “pyloromyotomy.” The constriction is relieved and allows normal passage of stomach contents into the duodenum.&quot;</span> 
The introduction describes the rationale in context of existing knowledge.

[Yes] <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Therefore, the aim of this study was to compare the results of LP and open pyloromyotomy (OP) by means of a systematic review of the available randomized trials while focusing on major complications (i.e., incomplete pyloromyotomy, perforation, and need for re-operation).&quot;</span>
The objectives explicitly state the focus on major complications. 

[NA]
A review protocol is not mentioned.

[Yes] <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Studies were included in the review if they were RCTs that compared the results of LP and OP in children with HPS with admission time after pyloromyotomy and postoperative complication rate as outcomes.&quot;</span>
Study eligibility criteria are specified.

[Yes] <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Retrieval of studies was performed through a systematic search of the databases PubMed, Ovid (Ovid Technologies, New York, NY) and Cochrane (Cochrane database of systematic reviews).&quot;</span> 
Databases searched are described.

[Yes] <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Keywords and medical subject heading (MeSH) terms used were “pyloric stenosis,” “pyloromyotomy,” “comparative studies,” “open,” “laparoscopic,” and “postoperative complications.”&quot;</span>
Full search strategy is presented for at least one database.

[Yes] <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Potentially eligible studies were reviewed independently by two authors (MWNO, RB) for inclusion and exclusion criteria.&quot;</span>
Study selection process is described.

[Yes] <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;From the included studies, data on setting, methodological quality [according to the Cochrane handbook for systematic reviews of interventions (http://dcc.cochrane.org/sites/dcc.cochrane.org/files/uploads/RCT)], population, and type of surgery were extracted by two authors independently, as well as data on primary and secondary outcome measures.&quot;</span>
Data collection process is described.

[Yes] <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The primary outcome was major postoperative complications (i.e., incomplete pyloromyotomy, perforation, and need for reoperation). Secondary outcomes were time to full feed, postoperative hospital stay, and any other postoperative complications.&quot;</span>
Outcomes for which data were sought are listed.

[Yes] <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Quality check of all RCTs&quot;</span>
Table 2 assesses risk of bias in included studies. 

[Yes] <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Primary outcome was major postoperative complications&quot;</span>
Major complications are appropriate summary measures for the primary outcome.

[Yes] 
Results of meta-analyses are presented with confidence intervals and measures of consistency.

[NA]
No assessment of risk of bias across studies is mentioned.

[NA]
No additional analyses are mentioned. 

[Yes] 
The flow diagram depicts numbers of studies screened, assessed, and included with reasons for exclusion. 

[Yes] 
Table 1 presents key characteristics of included studies.

[Yes] 
Table 2 and the results section summarize risk of bias within studies.

[Yes]
Figures 2 and 3 present summary data and effect estimates for primary and secondary outcomes. 

[Yes] 
Figure 4 presents meta-analysis results for time to full feeding.

[NA]
No assessment of bias across studies is presented.

[NA] 
No additional analyses are presented.

[Yes] <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;In our systematic review of high-level evidence, LP was found to be superior to OP with respect to a shorter time to full feed but not regarding (major) postoperative complications or length of hospital stay.&quot;</span>
Main findings are summarized.

[Yes] <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;However, in our opinion, there are some shortcomings in their results.&quot;</span> 
Limitations at the review level are discussed.

[Yes] <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;In this systematic review we summarized all RCTs available in the pediatric surgical literature, focusing mainly on major complications that need surgical reintervention in patients with HPS. However, our results show no clear benefit of the laparoscopic procedure over the open operation.&quot;</span> 
Conclusions in context of other evidence and implications are provided.

[Yes] <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Disclosures: Dr. M. W. N. Oomen, Dr. L.

The abstract provides a structured summary including the review objectives, data sources, eligibility criteria, methods, and main results.

[Yes] <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The pre-formed silo (PFS) is increasingly used in the management of gastroschisis, but its benefits remain unclear.&quot;</span>
The introduction describes the rationale for the review in the context of existing knowledge.

[Yes] <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The aim of this study was to evaluate current evidence comparing the use of a PFS with alternate treatment strategies in infants with gastroschisis.&quot;</span>
The introduction explicitly states the objectives, referring to participants, interventions, comparisons, and outcomes. 

[No]
No mention of a review protocol.

[Yes] <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Studies were selected for inclusion in the review if they reported comparative outcomes between infants treated with a PFS and infants treated with an alternate treatment strategy.&quot;</span>
The methods section specifies the eligibility criteria including participants, interventions, comparisons, and outcomes.

[Yes] <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;We searched Medline, Embase and the Cochrane controlled trials register from inception to July 2014 using the terms ‘gastroschisis’, ‘gastroschisis and silo’, ‘preformed silo’ and ‘silastic silo’.&quot;</span> 
The methods section describes the information sources searched including databases and dates.

[No]
The full search strategy for at least one database is not presented.

[Yes] <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The literature search, assessment for inclusion and data extraction were performed independently by three reviewers and disagreements resolved by consensus.&quot;</span>
The methods section describes the study selection process including screening and eligibility assessment.

[Yes] <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Data were extracted and entered into Review Manager (v5.1, The Cochrane Collaboration) and meta-analysis was performed using a random effects model due to variation in study design and reporting.&quot;</span>
The methods section describes the data collection process including data extraction and confirmation.

[Yes] <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;All outcomes were selected a priori. The primary outcome measure was time on a ventilator. Secondary outcomes were number of infants never ventilated, time on parenteral nutrition (PN), time to achieve full enteral feeds, length of hospital stay, incidence of necrotising enterocolitis, number of unplanned re-operations, infectious complications, mortality and occurrence of ventral hernia following repair.&quot;</span>
The methods section lists the variables, outcomes, and other data items collected.

[Yes] <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;One-thousand five-hundred and sixty-seven articles were identified using the specified search criteria and their abstracts reviewed. Following application against our inclusion criteria, 1440 were excluded on the basis of their abstract alone and the full text of 127 publications was scrutinised. One hundred and seven of these were subsequently excluded as they did not report a comparative group, did not use a PFS, or did not report outcomes from a group all treated with a PFS. Two further reports were excluded to avoid duplication of patients.&quot;</span>
The results section describes the study selection process including numbers screened, assessed, and included, with reasons for exclusions.

[Yes] Table 1 presents the characteristics of the included studies.

[NA]
No assessment of individual study risk of bias is presented since no meta-analysis was performed. 

[NA]
No results of individual studies are presented since no meta-analysis was performed.

No results of additional analyses are presented since no meta-analysis was performed.  

[Yes] <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;This systematic review aimed to determine comparative outcomes for infants with gastroschisis treated with either a PFS or alternate treatment strategy.&quot;</span>
The discussion summarizes the main findings and considers their relevance.

[Yes] <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The quality of evidence comparing PFS with alternate treatment strategies for gastroschisis is poor.&quot;</span> <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;As a result there is significant potential for both treatment and selection biases to influence the findings of this analysis.&quot;</span>
The discussion describes limitations at the study and outcome level.

[Yes] <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Further investigation is required to identify not only the optimal treatment pathway for infants with gastroschisis which will likely include a case by case decision algorithm, but also the tools by which to measure success.&quot;</span> 
The conclusion provides a general interpretation of the results and implications for future research.

[Yes] <span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Describe sources of funding for the systematic review and other support (e.g., supply of data); role of funders for the systematic review.&quot;</span>

[Yes] <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Single-Incision Pediatric Endosurgery: A Systematic Review&quot;</span> 

The title identifies the report as a systematic review.

[Yes] <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;We performed a systematic review of the literature to find out the current state of SIPES procedures, including age, technical aspects, and operative outcomes.&quot;</span>

The abstract describes the rationale, objectives, data sources, eligibility criteria, methods, and main results. 

[Yes] <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;In the search for less invasive procedures, ever since the development of laparoscopic surgery and with the limitations and equipment dependence of Natural Orifice Translumenal endoscopic surgery (NOTES®), this new approach through the umbilicus, a natural embrionary orifice,1 was first reported in 1992 by Pelosi and Pelosi.&quot;</span>

The introduction describes the rationale for the review.

[Yes] <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The objective of this review is to show the initial published experience about SIPES to evaluate its real benefits in terms of feasibility and clinical outcomes.&quot;</span>  

The introduction provides an explicit statement of the review questions.

[No]

The methods do not indicate if a review protocol exists.

[Yes] <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Articles were considered eligible if they met the following inclusion criteria: (1) Operations were performed through a single incision. (2) The target population was children under 18 years of age. (3) Operations performed exclusively by pediatric surgeons. (4) Series larger than 100 patients were included for appendectomy operations. (5) Case reports, case series, and comparative and prospective randomized trials were included in other, nonappendectomy, operations because of their low incidence. (6) Articles should include age, operative technical aspects, and operative outcomes.&quot;</span>

The eligibility criteria relating to population, interventions, studies are described.

[Yes] <span title='Moderate quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 94.9%):

[No] 

The search strategy is not presented in full for any database. 

[Yes] <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The initial reports consisted of extracorporeal appendectomies (laparoscopic-assisted procedures). However, fully laparoscopic SIPES appendectomies without any requirement of special flexible or articulated instruments had been reported as well.&quot;</span>

The process of study selection is described.

[No]

The data collection process is not described.

[Yes] <span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 99.5%):

Ports were defined as the access device chosen to perform the single-incision surgery. In pediatrics, these include multilumen devices such as the SILS™ Port (Covidien, Inc., Mansfield, MA) or the TriPort (Advanced Surgical Concepts, Bray, Ireland, United Kingdom) or the use of multiple cannulas or the combination of one-cannula and stab fascial incisions for passage of the instruments through a single skin incision.' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;Ports were defined as the access device chosen to perform the single-incision surgery.

[Yes]  <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;We identified a total of 4212 patients operated on by SIPES.&quot;</span>

The number of studies screened, assessed, and included is provided, with reasons for exclusion.

[Yes] <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Twelve articles fulfilled our inclusion criteria for SIPES appendectomy, including a total of 2422 patients.&quot;</span>

For each study, characteristics such as interventions, participants, and outcomes are presented.

[No]

A risk of bias assessment is not presented for the included studies.

[Yes] <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The mean operative time was longer with the SIPES approach in the prospective trial of St Peter et al., where a 10% conversion rate was described, a value similar to our 10.7% conversion rate found in this review (Table 5).&quot;</span>

For each outcome, summary data and effect sizes are presented for each study.

[Yes] <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;In terms of pain, it is believed that a larger umbilical incision may translate into more postoperative pain. However, others have speculated that limiting the number of incisions means decreasing trauma to the tissue and translates into reduced pain. Unfortunately, we did not find a uniform pain assessment among authors, and others did not even mention it.&quot;</span>

The synthesised findings are summarised, including the strength of evidence.

[Yes] <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Further analysis could not be performed because of the weak nature of the evidence in the majority of publications and some methodological defects of the literature reviewed. The low incidence of some pediatric surgical diseases (favoring case series with low level of evidence) and the lack of uniformity in evaluating some measures among surgeons, like pain assessment or cosmesis, for example, are the main contributors to this limitation.&quot;</span> 

The limitations at the study and outcome level, as well as at the review level, are discussed. 

[Yes] <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;From this systematic review we conclude: A wide experience in SIPES and its feasibility have already been described with good clinical outcomes and low rate of conversion.&quot;</span>

The conclusions summarize the main findings and put them into context of other evidence.

[Yes] <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;No competing financial interests exist.&quot;</span>

[Yes] <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Even though RCTs are the highest level of evidence, it should be recognised that data from non-randomised studies on the use of MIS in different types of solid intra‐thoracic and intra‐abdominal childhood tumours are available (Al‐Shanafey 2008; Castilho 2002; Duarte 2009; Iwanaka 2004; Leclair 2007; Metzelder 2007; Sailhamer 2003; Shanberg 2006; Spurbeck 2004; Varlet 2009; Warmann 2003).

Discusses limitations at study level.

[Yes] <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;However, the role of MIS as a primary curative technique compared to open surgery in children with solid intra‐thoracic or intra‐abdominal tumours can only be adequately determined through evaluation within prospective RCTs.&quot;</span>

Here are the relevant quotes and assessments for each PRISMA item:

P1: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Laparoscopic vs open herniorrhaphy in the management of pediatric inguinal hernia: a systemic review and meta-analysis&quot;</span>
[Yes] The title identifies the report as a systematic review and meta-analysis.

P2: <span title='Perfect quote from prompt (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Abstract / Structured summary: Provide a structured summary including, as applicable: background; objectives; data sources; study eligibility criteria, participants, and interventions; study appraisal and synthesis methods; results; limitations; conclusions and implications of key findings; systematic review registration number.&quot;</span>
[No] The abstract does not contain all the recommended elements.

P3: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;In recent years, LH has been evolved as a minimally invasive technique for PIH [7], [8]. In some centers, inguinal hernias have been treated routinely by the laparoscopic method, which is possible to discover the contralateral inguinal orifice [15].&quot;</span>  
[Yes] The introduction describes the rationale for the review.

P4: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;It has been believed that open hernia repair is still regarded as the gold standard for the treatment of PIH [9], [15]. It is important to critically evaluate the efficiency as well as the potential risks of laparoscopic techniques before they become the treatment modality of choice [9], [15].&quot;</span>
[No] The objectives do not explicitly mention PICOS.

P5: [NA] A review protocol is not mentioned. 

P6: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Although no language restrictions were imposed initially, the search was limited to studies published in the English language for the full-text review and final analysis. Eligibility criteria included all available studies comparing LH with OH (without diagnostic hernioscopy) for the repair of PIH and with quantitative data on outcome parameters.&quot;</span>
[Yes] Eligibility criteria relating to PICOS and study characteristics are described.

P7: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;All published studies until July 30, 2010, were searched with the terms laparoscopy, laparoscopic herniorrhaphy, pediatric inguinal hernia, and open herniorrhaphy from Medline (using PubMed as the search engine), Embase, Ovid, Web of Science, and Cochrane databases, without lower date limit.&quot;</span>
[Yes] Information sources including databases and dates are described. 

P8: [No] A full search strategy is not presented.

P9: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Studies with insufficient data for use in odds ratio (OR) analysis and 95% confidence interval (CI) or studies not providing adequate data to obtain mean values and standard deviation (SD) for continuous variables were excluded from the relevant calculations.&quot;</span> 
[Yes] The study selection process is described.

P10: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Three reviewers (YCL, ZHY, and TQS) independently assessed selected studies, extracted, and tabulated data from each article with a predefined data extraction form.&quot;</span>
[Yes] Data collection process is described.

P11: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Data regarding the following factors were considered: first author, publication date, study method, participant features, intervention characteristics, definition of complications, and outcome measures. Outcome parameters for inclusion were patients' age, sex, affected side, operative time, time to resume full activity, duration of hospital stay, recurrence, metachronic contralateral hernia, and complications.&quot;</span>
[Yes] Data items relating to PICOS are listed.

P12: [NA] Individual study bias assessment is not described.

P13: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Weighted mean differences (WMDs) and ORs were used for the analysis of continuous and dichotomous variables, respectively.&quot;</span>
[Yes] Summary measures are stated.

P14: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Statistical heterogeneity was assessed using the I2 statistics. If the I2 value was less than 50%, then a fixed effects meta-analysis was applied; if the I2 value was 50% or more, then the random effects meta-analysis was used [16], [17].&quot;</span> 
[Yes] Synthesis methods are described.

P15: [NA] No assessment of publication bias is mentioned.

P16: [NA] No additional analyses are mentioned. 

P17: [No] A study selection flow diagram is not provided.

P18: Table 1 provides summary characteristics for each included study.
[Yes] Study characteristics are presented.

P19: [NA] Individual study bias assessments are not presented.

P20: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Although only one study provided the data in mean ± SD [18], with nonapplicable heterogeneity, the analysis revealed that the hospital stay of LH was not significantly different from that of OH (Fig. 3C; WMD = 0.01; 95% CI, −0.08 to 0.10; P = .83).&quot;</span>
[Yes] Results for each study are presented using summary data and effect estimates.

P21: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Analysis of the pooled data revealed that the incidence of complications in OH group was not significantly different from that of LH group (OR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.45–1.41; P = .44; Fig. 5A).&quot;</span>
[Yes] Results of syntheses are presented.

P22: [NA] No assessment of publication bias is presented.

P23: [NA] No additional analyses are presented.

P24: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;In conclusion, in this systemic review and meta-analysis, we demonstrated that LH is efficient for the inguinal hernia repair in children, with similar operative time for unilateral hernia, length of hospital stay, recurrence, and complication rates with OH. Laparoscopic herniorrhaphy is superior to OH in the repair of bilateral PIH and lower rates of metachronic contralateral hernia.&quot;</span>
[Yes] A summary of the main findings is provided.

P25: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Because of the limited case number and insufficient data, the current meta-analysis possesses potential shortcomings to exactly compare some essential parameters between LH and OH, such as theater time, cost, quality of treatment, and postoperative MCIH.&quot;</span> 
[Yes] Limitations at the study and outcome level are discussed.

P26: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;We believe that until then, pediatric surgeons can make the better decision to choose LH or OH for the treatment of PIH.&quot;</span>
[Yes] Conclusions are made in the context of other evidence.

P6. [Yes]  
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Our inclusion criteria were formulated according to the ‘PICOS’ format as follows: Population: All infants born alive with the diagnosis of GS and who underwent abdominal defect closure. Intervention: Sutureless flap closure either primarily or after silo reduction, in simple and complex GS cases. Control: Operative fascial closure under general anesthesia either primarily or after a silo, in simple and complex GS cases.&quot;</span>
The methods section specifies eligibility criteria regarding population, interventions, comparators, and study design.

P7. [Yes]
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Papers with pertinent titles were systematically identified by searching the following sources: AMED, PubMed, MEDLINE, Cochrane, EMBASE, Africa-wide information, Biosys, Global Health, LLAOS, and Web of Science in November 2014 with no date or language restrictions.&quot;</span> 
The methods describe the information sources and date last searched.

P8. [Yes] 
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;For each of these databases, a search strategy guided by our institution's scientific librarian was established according to the database design (Appendix A).&quot;</span>
The methods provide the full search strategy for one database. 

P9. [Yes]
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;All of the resulting titles were twice inspected independently; papers were excluded if one of the following exclusion criteria were met: basic science or animal studies, non-comparative studies or case reports, or papers that did not include GS patients.&quot;</span>
The methods describe the study selection process including screening and eligibility.

P10. [No]
No quote provides details on data collection process.

P11. [Yes]  
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Outcomes analyzed included: mortality, ventilation days, feeding parameters, length of stay (LOS), wound infection, resource utilization, and umbilical hernia incidence.&quot;</span> 
The methods list the variables extracted.

P12. [Yes]
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) for case–control studies was used to critically appraise the quality of included papers [15].&quot;</span>
The methods describe the bias assessment at study level.

P13. [Yes]  
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Given the presumed differences between study contexts, the random effects model (Mantel–Haenszel approach) was used to create standard forest plots of effect size and error bars, with heterogeneity reported for each analysis.&quot;</span>
The methods state the summary measures used in meta-analysis.

P14. [NA]
Not applicable, as no meta-analysis was performed.

P15. [NA]  
Not applicable, as no assessment of bias across studies was done. 

P16. [NA] 
Not applicable, as no additional analyses were reported.

P17. [Yes]
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Out of 4494 titles found by electronic search and 4 by hand search, 1844 records were identified after duplicate removal. Title and abstracts screening subsequently excluded 1824 records. Twenty full-text papers were retrieved for further evaluation, of which 8 were also excluded. Finally, twelve studies (1 prospective [10] and 11 retrospective studies [17], [18], [19], [20], [21], [22], [23], [24], [25], [26], [27]) were included for qualitative and quantitative analyses.&quot;</span>
The results provide study selection details with number excluded at each stage. 

P18. [No]
No quote provides summary data on study characteristics.

P19. [Yes]  
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The quality of included studies was evaluated by the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) for Assessing the case–control studies shown in Table 2. Included studies were of moderate to high quality, scoring between 6 and 9 out of possible nine stars.&quot;</span>
The results present assessment of bias risk within individual studies.

P20. [No] 
No quote provides summary data for each intervention group.

P21. [NA] 
Not applicable, as no meta-analysis was performed.

P22. [NA]
Not applicable, as no assessment of bias across studies was done.

P23. [NA]
Not applicable, as no additional analyses were reported. 

P24. [Yes]
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;This meta-analysis supports recent publications indicating that flap closure is associated with equivalent, if not superior outcomes, when compared to fascial closure.&quot;</span>
The discussion summarizes the main findings and considers their relevance.

P25. [Yes] 
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The limitations of this review reflect the paucity of published comparative studies on the reviewed topic, the relatively low level of existing evidence, as well as a small sample size for most of the included studies.&quot;</span>
The discussion considers limitations at the study and outcome level.

P26. [Yes]
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Further prospective evidence is needed to clarify the role of flap closure for patients with gastroschisis.&quot;</span> 
The conclusion provides implications for future research.

P27. [Yes]
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Acknowledgments: We are indebted to Elena Guadagno, the librarian at the Montreal Children's Hospital for her help with the literature search.&quot;</span>

The title does not identify the study as a systematic review.

[Yes] <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Aim: It has been speculated that single incision pediatric endoscopic surgery (SIPES) in children could result in more postoperative pain given the device size for a child umbilicus. Herein, we compare the postoperative pain in children who underwent SIPES or standard laparoscopy (SL).&quot;</span>

The abstract provides structured background, objectives, interventions, and conclusions. 

[Yes] <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;More recently, single port surgery has been introduced in the adult practice first and in pediatrics later. Single incision pediatric endoscopic surgery (SIPES) is a minimally invasive surgical approach in which the surgeon operates exclusively through a single entry point, typically in the patient’s umbilicus.&quot;</span>

The introduction describes the rationale and context for the review.

[Yes] <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The aim of our study was to investigate whether children who underwent SIPES suffer from greater postoperative pain than those who underwent SL.&quot;</span>

The objectives are stated in the introduction.

The data collection process is not described. 

[Yes] <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The primary endpoint of this study was to compare the analgesic requirement of each patient (number of doses and dose/kg).&quot;</span>

[Yes] <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;In conclusion, the present study suggests that single port laparoscopic surgery in children is feasible, safe and associated with a similar postoperative pain to standard laparoscopy.&quot;</span>

The main findings and conclusions are summarized.

[Yes] <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;However, we do recognize the subjective nature of the cosmetic assessment that was based on parent personal satisfaction and assessment by the surgeon without formal qualitative or quantitative analysis.&quot;</span>

Limitations at the study and outcome level are discussed.

[Yes] <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;We agree with Iqbal and Ostlie,18 that even if SIPES does not confer a clear advantage over SL, in appropriate circumstances it can be offered to patients and their families who are happier having a scarless umbilicus.&quot;</span>

Conclusions are made in context of other evidence. 

[No]

[Yes] <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Recently, with more and more surgeons focusing on single-incision laparoscopic surgery (SILS), this kind of surgical procedure has improved a lot in the minimally invasive surgical field [15]. Due to the advantage of reducing the trauma of surgical access and cosmetic benefits, single-incision laparoscopic appendicectomy (SILA) has been widely accepted in the past few years among surgeons [19, 20].&quot;</span>
The introduction describes the rationale for the review.

[Yes] <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to compare clinical outcomes between single-incision laparoscopic appendicectomy and conventional laparoscopic appendicectomy in children.&quot;</span>

A summary of the evidence is provided.

[Yes] <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Our systematic review and meta-analysis does have some limitations. On one hand, the overall methodologic quality and reporting of the included trials in children was poor. Some included studies had rather small sample size. On the other hand, there was evidence of statistical heterogeneity among different studies in terms of operative time and length of hospital stay.&quot;</span>
Limitations at the study and outcome level are discussed.

[Yes] <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;In conclusion, our study suggests that SILA is a feasible and safe surgical procedure alternative to CLA for pediatric patients with appendicitis. It reveals significantly shorter hospital stay and potential comparable operative time, postoperative complications such as wound infection, intra-abdominal infection, and ileus compared with CLA. However, most of the studies included in our meta-analysis were retrospective studies. Therefore, more prospective randomized controlled trials are needed in children to draw a more convincing conclusion.&quot;</span>
Conclusions and implications for future research are described.

Earlier diagnosis, better understanding of pathogenesis, and technical refinements led to a subsequent advancement to single-stage pull-throughs in the early 1980s.6 With the introduction of minimally invasive surgery, classic pull-through techniques were modified and improved with laparoscopy,7 leading to the clear advantages of reduced pain and improved cosmesis in comparison with open surgery.8 Such advantages inspired the introduction of the single-stage transanal endorectal pull-through (TERPT) by de la Torre-Mondragón and Ortega-Salgado9 in 1998.\n\n4. This paragraph describes the rationale and background for the review.\n\n[Yes]\n\n5. Our study is the first systematic review and meta-analysis comparing long-term outcomes for open Duhamel (OD) and laparoscopic Duhamel (LD) procedures for HD, to identify any added advantage of the laparoscopic technique.\n\n6. This states the objective of comparing open vs laparoscopic Duhamel procedures. \n\n[Yes]\n\n7. No review protocol or registration is mentioned.\n\n[No]\n\n8. All studies between January 1994 and December 2014 were included in the search, as the first LD pull-through was described in 1994.14 Combinations of the key words “Hirschsprung disease,” “Duhamel,” “pull-through,” “laparoscopic,” “minimally invasive” and “open” were used.\n\n9. The search strategy for one database is described.\n\n[Yes]\n\n10. Reference lists were then manually searched for additional studies.\nAll studies assessing functional outcome for OD and/or LD procedures were analyzed for eligibility, including randomized control trials and observational studies. Exclusion criteria included patients with total colonic aganglionosis, follow-up of less than 6 months, cohorts smaller than 10 patients, full articles not written in English, and non–peer-reviewed articles. Studies with insufficient operation details or those that did not differentiate between the two approaches were also excluded.\n\n11. The study selection process is described. \n\n[Yes]\n\n12. Data collected included study characteristics (author, journal, publication year, sample size, length of follow-up, and operative technique) and patient demographics (sex and age at surgery). Outcome parameters included incidence of enterocolitis, constipation, fecal incontinence or soiling, and further surgery, length of operation, length of hospital stay, and time taken to tolerate full oral feeds. \n\n13. The data collection process is described.\n\n[Yes]\n\n14. The data items collected are listed.\n\n[Yes] \n\n15. Our review only included published studies, and no contact with authors was made to obtain unpublished data, nor were conference abstracts included due to the limited data available.\n\n16. This mentions that unpublished data were not obtained.\n\n[Yes]\n\n17. A cumulative meta-analysis was then performed, to compare the incidence of each outcome in patients who underwent the OD procedure with those who underwent the LD procedure. Odds ratios (ORs) were calculated for dichotomous variables using the Mantel–Haenszel method, and mean difference values were calculated for continuous variables using the inverse variance method. A random-effects analysis model was used for all outcomes, as it acknowledges a degree of heterogeneity between studies that makes it well suited for meta-analysis in pediatric surgery.16 The confidence interval (CI) was established at 95%, and statistical differences were considered as significant for a value of P < .05 (two tailed). Statistical heterogeneity was assessed using I2. Statistical analysis was performed using Review Manager version 5.2 software (Cochrane Collaboration, London, United Kingdom).\n\n18. The methods for synthesis of results are described.\n\n[Yes]\n\n19. None of the additional analyses mentioned in P16 were performed.\n\n[NA] \n\n20. PRISMA flow diagram provided. \n\n[Yes]\n\n21. Table 1 provides characteristics of included studies.\n\n[Yes] \n\n22. Not done.\n\n[NA]\n\n23. Not done. \n\n[NA]\n\n24. Our meta-analysis convincingly demonstrates the superiority of LD over OD pull-through for HD.\n\n25. Provides a summary of the main findings.\n\n[Yes]\n\n26. The results of our meta-analysis should be carefully interpreted. The following are unavoidable limitations:\n\n- None of the studies included prospective data or randomized control trials.\n\n- Data were not available for length of aganglionic segment, alongside other important outcomes such as anastomotic stricture and postoperative adhesions, which were not included in enough studies to be treated by meta-analysis.8,27,28 \n\n- The surgical learning curve has not been taken into account. \n\n27. Limitations are discussed.\n\n[Yes]\n\n28. Our meta-analysis proposes that LD pull-through is superior to OD pull-through for HD. The laparoscopic technique resulted in a significantly reduced incidence of postoperative soiling/incontinence and a reduced requirement for further surgery. Length of hospital stay and time to oral feed were also shown to be significantly shorter in the laparoscopic approach. There was no significant difference in incidence of postoperative enterocolitis and constipation, whereas operative time for an OD procedure was significantly shorter. However, the lack of large prospective studies remains a weakness, and randomized control trials with detailed follow-up and agreed definition of outcome parameters are required to overcome limitations in current studies.\n\n29. Provides conclusions and implications for future research.\n\n[Yes]\n\n30.

You are an expert in systematic reviews and are tasked to assess the reporting quality of a systematic review with the PRISMA 2009 tool based on the full text of its publication. PRISMA 2009 consist of the following items:

---
# PRISMA 2009
P1. Title: Identify the report as a systematic review, meta-analysis, or both.
P2. Abstract / Structured summary: Provide a structured summary including, as applicable: background; objectives; data sources; study eligibility criteria, participants, and interventions; study appraisal and synthesis methods; results; limitations; conclusions and implications of key findings; systematic review registration number.
P3. Introduction / Rationale: Describe the rationale for the review in the context of what is already known.
P4. Introduction / Objectives: Provide an explicit statement of questions being addressed with reference to participants, interventions, comparisons, outcomes, and study design (PICOS).
P5. Methods / Protocol and registration: Indicate if a review protocol exists, if and where it can be accessed (e.g., Web address), and, if available, provide registration information including registration number.
P6. Methods / Eligibility criteria: Specify study characteristics (e.g., PICOS, length of follow-up) and report characteristics (e.g., years considered, language, publication status) used as criteria for eligibility, giving rationale.
P7. Methods / Information sources: Describe all information sources (e.g., databases with dates of coverage, contact with study authors to identify additional studies) in the search and date last searched.
P8. Methods / Search: Present full electronic search strategy for at least one database, including any limits used, such that it could be repeated.
P9. Methods / Study selection: State the process for selecting studies (i.e., screening, eligibility, included in systematic review, and, if applicable, included in the meta-analysis).
P10. Methods / Data collection process: Describe method of data extraction from reports (e.g., piloted forms, independently, in duplicate) and any processes for obtaining and confirming data from investigators.
P11. Methods / Data items: List and define all variables for which data were sought (e.g., PICOS, funding sources) and any assumptions and simplifications made.
P12. Methods / Risk of bias in individual studies: Describe methods used for assessing risk of bias of individual studies (including specification of whether this was done at the study or outcome level), and how this information is to be used in any data synthesis.
P13. Methods / Summary measures: State the principal summary measures (e.g., risk ratio, difference in means).
P14. Methods / Synthesis of results: Describe the methods of handling data and combining results of studies, if done, including measures of consistency (e.g., I2) for each meta-analysis.
P15. Methdos / Risk of bias across studies: Specify any assessment of risk of bias that may affect the cumulative evidence (e.g., publication bias, selective reporting within studies).
P16. Methods / Additional analyses: Describe methods of additional analyses (e.g., sensitivity or subgroup analyses, meta-regression), if done, indicating which were pre-specified.
P17. Results / Study selection: Give numbers of studies screened, assessed for eligibility, and included in the review, with reasons for exclusions at each stage, ideally with a flow diagram.
P18. Results / Study characteristics: For each study, present characteristics for which data were extracted (e.g., study size, PICOS, follow-up period) and provide the citations.
P19. Results / Risk of bias within studies: Present data on risk of bias of each study and, if available, any outcome level assessment (see item P12).
P20. Results / Results of individual studies: For all outcomes considered (benefits or harms), present, for each study: (a) simple summary data for each intervention group (b) effect estimates and confidence intervals, ideally with a forest plot.
P21. Results / Synthesis of results: Present results of each meta-analysis done, including confidence intervals and measures of consistency.
P22. Results / Risk of bias across studies: Present results of any assessment of risk of bias across studies (see Item P15).
P23. Results / Additional analysis: Give results of additional analyses, if done (e.g., sensitivity or subgroup analyses, meta-regression [see Item P16]).
P24. Discussion / Summary of evidence: Summarize the main findings including the strength of evidence for each main outcome; consider their relevance to key groups (e.g., healthcare providers, users, and policy makers).
P25. Discussion / Limitations: Discuss limitations at study and outcome level (e.g., risk of bias), and at review-level (e.g., incomplete retrieval of identified research, reporting bias).
P26. Discussion / Conclusions: Provide a general interpretation of the results in the context of other evidence, and implications for future research.
P27. Funding: Describe sources of funding for the systematic review and other support (e.g., supply of data); role of funders for the systematic review.

For each of the PRISMA items (P1 to P27) perform the following steps. Do not repeat the items' names / instructions.
1. Extract one relevant short quote from the full text.
2. Explain your reasoning in one short sentence.
3. Respond with either "[Yes]" if the item was reported, "[No]" if not reported, or "[NA]" if not applicable (for example, items P14, P15, P16, P21, P22, P23 in the context of a systematic review without a meta-analysis).

Be as concise as possible and avoid unnecessary repetitions. Before stopping, make sure you've processed all 27 PRISMA items. Do not provide a final summary paragraph in the end.
