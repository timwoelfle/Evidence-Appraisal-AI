Reasoning: The eligibility criteria seem quite broad and pragmatic, aiming to resolve clinical uncertainties that are important for real-world outcomes. The trial was registered in a public database. However, some specific criteria were considered like feasibility of the interventions in the participating countries, which adds a bit of an explanatory element.

There were no statistically significant differences within any of the intervention pairs for the primary outcome: blunt versus sharp entry risk ratio 1·03 (95% CI 0·91–1·17), exterior versus intra-abdominal repair 0·96 (0·84–1·08), single-layer versus double-layer closure 0·96 (0·85–1·08), closure versus non-closure 1·06 (0·94–1·20), and chromic catgut versus polyglactin-910 0·90 (0·78–1·04).&quot;</span>
Reasoning: The recruitment process involved widespread consultation to identify relevant clinical questions, which is a pragmatic approach. A large number of women (15,935) were recruited across multiple countries. No details are provided on additional recruitment efforts beyond routine care.

Their PNs for diabetes care were randomly assigned to an intervention or control arm.' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;All the family practices of one regional organisation of GPs (a so-called 'care group') in the North of the Netherlands were eligible to participate in the study. GPs were asked to participate in the SMS project. Their PNs for diabetes care were randomly assigned to an intervention or control arm.&quot;</span>
The trial recruited from a single regional organization of general practices, and the eligibility criteria were quite broad, essentially including all practices and patients in that group. This is a fairly pragmatic approach, although not as pragmatic as recruiting from all practices in the region.
Score: [4]

Recruitment:
Quotes: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;GPs were asked to participate in the SMS project. Their PNs for diabetes care were randomly assigned to an intervention or control arm.&quot;</span>
Recruitment was done by asking GPs to participate, and then randomizing their practice nurses. This is more effort than would be done in usual care, but less than many explanatory trials that individually recruit patients. It's a moderately pragmatic approach.
Score: [3]

Setting:
Quotes: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;In European countries, most patients with diabetes receive follow-up care in the primary care setting by nurses.&quot;</span>
The trial was conducted in the same primary care setting where most diabetes follow-up care is typically delivered in the country, making it a highly pragmatic choice of setting.
Score: [5]

Organization:
Quotes: <span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 99.3%):

The starting point was a nurse-led minimal psychological intervention. A previous randomised trial has shown that this intervention was cost-effective for patients with diabetes with minor to moderate depression: 9 months after receiving the intervention, depressive symptoms were significantly lower, there was a positive effect on patients’ quality of life, and patients experienced less anxiety, possessed more selfefficacy skills, demonstrated better glycaemic control and showed more participation in comparison to control patients.' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;The starting point was a nurse-led minimal psychological intervention. A previous randomised trial has shown that this intervention was cost-effective for patients with diabetes with minor to moderate depression: 9 months after receiving the intervention, depressive symptoms were significantly lower, there was a positive effect on patients' quality of life, and patients experienced less anxiety, possessed more self-efficacy and demonstrated better glycaemic control and showed more participation in comparison to control patients.&quot;</span>
The intervention builds on an existing nurse-led psychological intervention that has previously been shown to be effective and cost-effective. Basing the intervention on an existing program makes the organization more pragmatic than implementing something very novel.
Score: [4]

Flexibility (delivery):
Quotes: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;SMS included a detection and follow-up phase. The flow chart of SMS is presented in figure 1. The detection phase of SMS started by exploring whether a patient experienced problems in daily life. PNs then applied the DFT by showing patients a vertical line ranging from 0 to 10 with 0 indicating no burden at all and 10 indicating extreme burden, and asking them to rate the burden of diabetes in their daily life.&quot;</span>
The intervention had a specified process of detection and follow-up, but allowed some flexibility in how the nurses administered the DFT and counseling. It was not an entirely strict protocol but did have a defined structure.
Score: [3]

Flexibility (adherence):
There is no mention of any measures of participant adherence or compliance with the intervention. All participants seem to have been included in the analysis regardless of their level of participation. This reflects a pragmatic, intention-to-treat approach with no additional adherence monitoring.
Score: [5]

Follow-up:
Quotes: <span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 95.1%):

The glycated haemoglobin in mmol/mol was measured during consultations. For the baseline measure, we used data from the first consultation after the patient’s baseline measurement (with a maximum interval of 3 months). The consultation following this first consultation was used as the 4-month follow-up measurement.' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;The glycaemic control of patients was measured during consultations. For the baseline measure, we used data from the first consultation after the patient's baseline measurement (maximum interval of 3 months). The consultation following this first consultation was used as the 4-month follow-up measurement.&quot;</span>
Data collection occurred during regular patient consultations, without any additional research-specific follow-up visits. This is a very pragmatic approach, using only data collected as part of routine care.
Score: [5]

Primary outcome:
Quotes: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The effect of SMS on patients' daily functioning was measured by means of the DFT. The DFT was dichotomised to compare the number of patients who were improved in their daily functioning and had apparently found a satisfactory way to live with the consequences of their diabetes (DFT ≤4) with patients who still perceived a burden of diabetes on their daily functioning (DFT >4).&quot;</span>
The primary outcome was a patient-reported measure of the burden of diabetes on daily functioning, which is directly relevant to patients. The DFT is a simple 0-10 scale that appears feasible to administer as part of routine care. This represents a pragmatic choice of primary outcome.
Score: [4]

Primary analysis:
Quotes: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Analyses were performed on an intention-to-treat basis.&quot;</span>

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Other eligibility criteria for both trials included, at screening, a peak expiratory flow (PEF) greater than 50% of the predicted value after an inhaled beta2-agonist had been withheld for 4 hours or longer and, at the baseline visit, evidence of impaired asthma-related quality of life (a score ≤6 on the Mini Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire25,26 [MiniAQLQ]) or impaired asthma control (a score ≥1 on the Asthma Control Questionnaire27 [ACQ]).&quot;</span>

The eligibility criteria included patients with impaired asthma-related quality of life or inadequate asthma control based on validated questionnaires. While these criteria would identify patients likely to be treated in usual care, the specific thresholds used on the questionnaires are more stringent than what would typically be used in routine practice. The PEF criterion is also more explanatory. Overall, the eligibility criteria are moderately explanatory.

The primary outcome was the Mini Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire (MiniAQLQ) score, which is a validated patient-reported measure directly relevant to asthma patients. Several secondary outcomes were also patient-important, including asthma control, rhinitis-related quality of life, and exacerbation frequency. The outcome measures are very pragmatic.

The eligibility criteria were quite broad, with patients advised to exercise regularly as usual care in the control group. The intervention group also received usual care with some additional assessments. This suggests the trial included a broad patient population similar to those who would receive the intervention as part of usual care.

Eligibility:
Quotes: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Eighty people with Expanded Disability Status scores of 1 to 6.5 participated in this trial.&quot;</span>
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;At enrollment, all participants underwent a clinical examination by a neurologist (F.O.) to assess their EDSS scores and review their medical history, noting the type of MS, age, sex, weight, height, and medications.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: The trial included participants with EDSS scores of 1 to 6.5, which represents a fairly broad range of disability levels. The enrollment criteria seem similar to what would be used in usual care, with a clinical examination by a neurologist to assess EDSS and medical history. However, the specific EDSS range of 1-6.5 is a bit narrower than the full spectrum of MS disability.

Standard care included the usual care in individuals with MS in the same municipalities. Assessments at all time points took place at a Norwegian hospital.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: The intervention was conducted in typical community settings (municipalities) where usual care would take place. Assessments were done at a single hospital, which is slightly different from usual care. Overall, the setting is largely representative of where the intervention and assessments would occur in usual care.

Reasoning: The intervention was delivered by neurological physical therapists who received 5 days of specific training, which is more than would be typical in usual care. However, the therapists had varied prior experience with MS treatment, making them generally representative of usual care providers. The organization of care appears to be similar to usual care, with no major additional resources.

Reasoning: There was some flexibility in delivery, as therapists could choose from a menu of 33 exercises and 5 difficulty levels to tailor the program to each individual. However, participants were all given the same illustrated exercise booklet and instructed to perform the exercises twice weekly for 30 minutes, demonstrating a degree of standardization in the delivery protocol.

Quotes: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants in both groups were encouraged to continue their usual medical treatment.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: Participants were encouraged to continue usual medical treatment, suggesting no major efforts were made to enforce strict adherence to the study intervention. No information is provided about any adherence monitoring or whether lack of adherence was a basis for exclusion. There is insufficient information to fully judge flexibility of adherence.
Score: [NA] 

Follow-up:
Quotes: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Assessments were undertaken at baseline and at weeks 7, 18, and 30. Outcomes were measured with the Trunk Impairment Scale–Norwegian Version, Mini Balance Evaluation Systems Test, and Patient Global Impression of Change–Balance. Repeated-measures mixed models were used for statistical analysis.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: Assessments were done at baseline and 3 follow-up timepoints up to 30 weeks. This is more intensive than typical follow-up in usual care for this condition. The outcome measures (questionnaires and performance tests) also appear to be more extensive than what would normally be used in usual care.

Reasoning: The primary outcomes of balance and trunk control, assessed by a combination of performance tests and patient-reported measures, appear to be relevant and important to individuals with MS. However, the specific tests used (TIS-NV, Mini-BESTest) may not be routinely used in usual care to assess balance.

Reasoning: The primary analysis was intention-to-treat and appears to have included all participants except one who missed all post-intervention assessments. This suggests the analysis was largely pragmatic, including most participants regardless of adherence. However, it's not fully clear if there were any other exclusions from the analysis.

Exclusion criteria were as follows: co-morbidity in terms of cognitive disorders or alcohol abuse (based on clinical judgment), pathologies that did not allow systematic PRT >1 session/week within the last 3 months.' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ff9e81'>&quot;Exclusion criteria were as follows: co-morbidity in terms of cognitive disorders or alcohol abuse (based on clinical judgment), pathologies that did not allow systematic PRT and BMCT and PRT lasting the last 3 months.&quot;</span>

The trial used a mix of pragmatic and explanatory eligibility criteria. Recruiting from MS clinics and the MS Society is fairly pragmatic. However, there were several exclusion criteria based on disease severity (EDSS score, SSST, T25FW), recent relapses, medication changes, comorbidities, and prior therapy that would not be applied in usual care. Overall, the eligibility criteria were more explanatory than pragmatic.

1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants were included from September 2016 to October 2018, after being invited via seven MS clinics (specified in &quot;</span>Acknowledgements<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot; section) and targeted advertisements sent out via the Danish MS Society.&quot;</span>

Participants were recruited pragmatically through usual MS clinics. The only extra effort was sending targeted advertisements through the MS Society, which is a route that may sometimes be used to engage patients in usual care. Overall, the recruitment procedures were very pragmatic with minimal extra effort beyond usual care.

Allocation of interventions was done by a cluster randomization conducted whenever a sufficient number of patients were established at three different participating clinics.&quot;</span>

The interventions were delivered at multiple usual physiotherapy clinics, indicating a very pragmatic setting identical to where patients would receive care outside of the trial.

Organization:
Quotes:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Physiotherapists with experience in providing BMCT managed the programs. The therapists were instructed to aim for a level of difficulty, where the participants experienced failure but still reached successful execution in more than 50% of the attempts/time.&quot;</span>
2. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The BMCT intervention consisted of 20 1-hour training sessions over 10 weeks (two sessions/ week). All sessions started with a 10-minute warm-up on a stationary bicycle or treadmill.&quot;</span>

The organization of the BMCT intervention involved specialized physiotherapists and a regimented schedule of 20 1-hour sessions over 10 weeks, which differs from the flexibility of usual care. However, the sessions were delivered at usual physiotherapy clinics. This represents a mix of pragmatic and explanatory elements in the trial's organization.

2. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The BMCT intervention consisted of 20 1-hour training sessions over 10 weeks (two sessions/ week). All sessions started with a 10-minute warm-up on a stationary bicycle or treadmill.&quot;</span>

The BMCT intervention followed a strict protocol of supervised 1-hour sessions twice per week for 10 weeks, always starting with a 10-minute warmup. While there was some flexibility in the type of exercise machines used between centers, overall the delivery of the intervention was tightly controlled, making it very explanatory.

Follow-up assessments were done only at the end of the 10-week intervention period. This schedule is not more intensive than usual care follow-up would be. However, the 30-meter walkway test and ABC questionnaire likely exceed what would be used to assess patients in usual care. Overall, the follow-up is a mix of pragmatic and explanatory approaches.

Primary outcome:
Quotes:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The primary outcomes were walking speed assessed by the T25FW20 and complex walking assessed by the SSST.21 Both outcomes were obtained at the fastest safe walking speed and conducted in accordance with the original descriptions.&quot;</span>

The primary outcomes of walking speed (T25FW) and complex walking (SSST) are performance measures that are highly relevant to MS patients. They were conducted according to standard protocols at the fastest safe speed. This reflects a pragmatic approach, as these outcomes have clear importance to participants. However, the SSST may not be widely used in usual care, making the outcome measures slightly more explanatory than fully pragmatic.

All patients were assessed by a consultant neurologist with an interest in MS prior to entering the trial. The inclusion criteria for the trial were clinical diagnosis of MS, as defined by the modified McDonald criteria,9 with an Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score of 1.0–6.5, and able to walk a 10-metre distance; aged 18–65 years; clinically stable for at least four weeks prior to entering the study; physically able to participate in exercise three times per week; able to provide written informed consent.&quot;</span>
The eligibility criteria were fairly broad, including people with a range of disability levels (EDSS 1.0-6.5) who were clinically stable. However, there were still several exclusion criteria that differ from usual care, such as age limits, ability to participate in exercise 3 times per week, and ability to provide informed consent.

Participants were recruited through a combination of clinic visits and community outreach via the MS Society. This goes somewhat beyond usual care recruitment methods by including the community adverts, but is not a highly targeted approach.
Score: [4]

Setting:
Quotes: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants in the usual care group were offered three exercise sessions at the university research facility and individual exercise advice after the study.&quot;</span>
The study was conducted at a university research facility, which differs from a usual care setting. However, the usual care group was offered sessions at this facility after the study, providing some connection to real-world settings.
Score: [3] 

Organization:
Quotes: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;An exercise physiologist supervised the delivery of the intervention but with physiotherapist input during the early stages of the programme. During weeks 1–6, participants attended two supervised sessions per week at a university exercise research facility and engaged in one additional self-directed exercise session in their home environment.&quot;</span>
The intervention required attendance at supervised sessions at a university facility and involved an exercise physiologist and physiotherapist. This level of expertise and organization goes beyond what would typically be available in usual care.
Score: [2]

Flexibility (delivery):
Quotes: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Supervised exercise sessions involved up to three participants and lasted for approximately one hour. Studies show that aerobic exercise, resistance exercise and combined programmes bring health benefits to PwMS.10,11 Hence, the programme was designed to be pragmatic and accessible, taking into account exercise preferences and giving choices.&quot;</span>
The supervised sessions had a set structure of about one hour with up to three participants. However, the program aimed to be pragmatic and accessible by considering participant preferences and providing choices. This suggests a moderate level of flexibility in delivery.
Score: [3]

Flexibility (adherence):
Quotes: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Adherence to the supervised and home-exercise sessions was very good, with participants attending an average of 16.2 of the 18 supervised sessions (90%; range 7–18 sessions) and participating in an average of 14.6 of the 18 prescribed home-exercise sessions (81%, range 2–18 sessions).&quot;</span>
Adherence was reported to be very good, with participants attending a high percentage of both supervised and home sessions. No information is provided about measures to improve or enforce adherence. The flexibility appears similar to what would be expected in usual care.
Score: [4]

Follow-up:
Quotes: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Outcomes were assessed at baseline, and at three months (post-intervention) and nine months after randomisation. The primary outcome was self-reported exercise behaviour at three months using the Godin Leisure Time Exercise Questionnaire (GLTEQ).14 The GLTEQ asks participants to recall the frequency of strenuous, moderate and mild intensity exercise for periods >15 minutes over the past seven days and is a valid measure of habitual exercise in PwMS.15 Daily movement and step counts were objectively assessed using an accelerometer (Actigraph GT2M accelerometer, Actigraph, LLC, FL, USA), worn on the waist during waking hours, except when bathing/showering or swimming.&quot;</span>
Follow-up assessments occurred at baseline, 3 months, and 9 months. This schedule is more frequent than typical usual care follow-up. The outcomes were a mix of self-report and objective measures (accelerometry), which also goes beyond usual care.

Primary analysis:
Quotes: <span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 99.8%):

A total of 13 participants (six from the intervention group and seven from the usual care group) were lost to follow-up at three months. An additional eight participants were lost to follow-up at nine months (five from the intervention group and three from the usual care group; Figure 1). Participants that dropped out of the study were slightly younger than the study completers (43.3 vs 46.3 years) and had higher baseline EDSS and total fatigue scores (4.5 vs 3.6 and 48.0 vs 42.6, respectively). During the nine-month study period, 16 MS relapses were experienced by 14 of the usual care participants in comparison to 10 MS relapses experienced by nine participants in the exercise group. Participants were encouraged to rejoin the trial following recovery, and complete or partial follow-up data were obtained for 21 of the 23 relapsing participants.' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;A total of 13 participants (six from the intervention group and seven from the usual care group) were lost to follow-up at three months.

The analysis included all participants who provided follow-up data, even if they had MS relapses during the study. Efforts were made to collect data on relapsing participants after recovery. However, those lost to follow-up were not included and had some differing baseline characteristics from completers. The approach leans pragmatic but falls short of a full intention-to-treat analysis.

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Twenty-four participants were recruited. The recruitment rate, calculated as the proportion of those invited to fill in a screening questionnaire who consented into the trial, was 4.1%.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: The trial recruited participants with MS and depression from out-patient clinics and postal screening questionnaires at only two UK centers. The low recruitment rate of 4.1% suggests the trial used a very selective approach not representative of the wider MS population with depression. This indicates a more explanatory than pragmatic approach to eligibility.

Blinding the Blues® consists of eight computer-interactive sessions, of approximately 50 minutes each in duration, designed to be taken weekly. Each session consists of a mix of cognitive and behavioural strategies, which the user customises to their individual problems.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: The intervention consisted of 8 weekly computer sessions of about 50 minutes each, with content tailored to the individual, but still following a defined schedule. This represents a balance between rigor and flexibility in delivery. It is not as strict as a rigid protocol but more structured than usual care would likely be.
Score: [3]

Flexibility (adherence):
Quotes: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Of the 12 patients in the CCBT arm, 9 (75%) completed at least four CCBT sessions. This translated to a reasonably high compliance rate of CCBT although only six (50%) of the patients in this arm completed all intended eight CCBT sessions.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: 75% of CCBT arm participants completed at least 4 of the 8 intended sessions, indicating a reasonably high but not perfect level of adherence. This is a balanced approach between the extremes of strict adherence monitoring and exclusion based on adherence (explanatory) and no adherence monitoring at all (pragmatic).

Reasoning: Follow-up assessments were conducted at 0, 8 and 21 weeks by postal questionnaires. This schedule is more frequent than usual care follow-up would likely be, but not excessively so. The use of postal questionnaires is a pragmatic approach, although the challenges in obtaining responses and need for multiple reminders introduces some explanatory elements.

Reasoning: The primary outcome of recruitment rate is of clear relevance to trial feasibility but is not directly meaningful to participants. A more participant-centered primary outcome would be more pragmatic. However, the secondary outcomes of depression, anxiety and quality of life are important to patients.

<pre>
Eligibility:
Quotes: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Key inclusion criteria permitted the participation of men or women ≥18 years of age with confirmed and documented RRMS diagnosis (as defined by the Revised McDonald criteria) (Polman et al., 2011), Kurtzke Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score of 0 to 5.5 at the screening visit, and, 30 days prior to randomization, a stable neurological condition, relapse-free status, and no use of any corticosteroid or adrenocorticotropic hormone treatment.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: The eligibility criteria are somewhat stricter than what would be used in usual care for RRMS patients. The age cutoff of 18 years is reasonable, but the EDSS score restriction to 0-5.5 and requirements of stable neurological condition, relapse-free status, and no recent steroid use are more stringent than usual care. However, the criteria are not extremely narrow either.
Score: [3]

Recruitment:
Quotes: No relevant quotes identified regarding recruitment methods.
Reasoning: The full text does not provide any details on the recruitment methods used in this trial and how they compare to usual care. There is insufficient information to assess how pragmatic or explanatory the recruitment was.
Score: [NA] 

Setting:
Quotes: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The CONFIDENCE study was a multinational, multicenter, randomized, parallel-group, phase 4, open-label study conducted at 88 study centers in 14 countries (Russia, Poland, Italy, France, Croatia, US [including Puerto Rico], Mexico, Spain, Austria, Turkey, Belgium, Argentina, Germany, and Finland) across different geographic regions.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: The trial was conducted at 88 centers across 14 countries in varied geographic regions. This is a relatively diverse and real-world range of settings, more pragmatic than a single-center or single-country explanatory trial. However, it's not clear if all the centers were typical community practices or if some were specialized academic centers.
Score: [4]

Organization:
Quotes: No relevant quotes identified regarding differences in resources, provider expertise or organization of care delivery between the trial and usual care.
Reasoning: The full text does not provide enough details to assess how the organization of care in the trial differed from usual care. Specialty of the treating clinicians, their MS experience level, and clinic resources are not described.
Score: [NA]

Flexibility (delivery):
Quotes: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Patients' adherence to treatment measured at Months 1, 3, and 6 using the MS-TAQ questionnaire showed consistently greater adherence to treatment in patients receiving GA40 compared with those receiving GA20 (Fig. 5). RM ANOVA analyses of MS-TAQ total scores during the 6-month treatment period showed significantly lower MS-TAQ scores in patients treated with GA40 than with GA20 during that time, indicating higher adherence to GA40 versus GA20 (table e-4).&quot;</span>
Reasoning: The trial assessed adherence using a questionnaire at multiple timepoints, indicating some flexibility in intervention delivery to accommodate differences in adherence between the GA40 and GA20 groups. However, the degree of flexibility in the protocol is not explicitly stated. The text suggests flexibility more similar to usual care than a highly rigid explanatory trial.

Flexibility (adherence):
Quotes: <span title='Major quote deviation, possible hallucination. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 22.3%):

Patients with treatment-emergent adverse event' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: red'>&quot;Patients withdrawn (n=32) Death (n=1) Adverse event (n=14) Withdrawal by patient (n=10) Protocol violation (n=1) Lost to follow-up (n=2) Other (n=4)&quot;</span>
Reasoning: The patient disposition shows that 10 patients withdrew from the trial and 1 was lost to follow-up, suggesting that patient adherence to the intervention was not strictly enforced as it would be in an explanatory trial. Patients were allowed to withdraw for various reasons. However, the full flexibility of adherence compared to usual care is not clearly described.
Score: [4]

Follow-up:
Quotes: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Safety assessments were recorded in clinic visits and included adverse events (AEs) throughout the study, vital sign measurements, concomitant medication usage, and clinical laboratory test results at screening and Months 1, 3, and 6. Safety variables monitored also included the percentage of early treatment discontinuation patients who prematurely discontinued from the study due to AEs, as well as the time to withdrawal.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: Safety assessments were conducted at in-person clinic visits at screening, Months 1, 3 and 6. This follow-up schedule is somewhat more frequent than typical usual care for RRMS patients, but not as intensive as an explanatory trial. The 6-month duration is also fairly typical for assessing RRMS therapies. Inclusion of early discontinuation and time to withdrawal analyses suggests a more pragmatic approach to follow-up.

Reasoning: The primary analysis was conducted using an intention-to-treat approach including all randomized patients according to their assigned groups. This pragmatic strategy matches how effectiveness would be assessed in real-world practice, in contrast to an explanatory per-protocol analysis including only fully adherent patients. Missing data and early discontinuations do not appear to have been excluded.

The training protocol was increased when two sets of 12 repetitions of an exercise could be completed.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: The intervention used standard gym equipment and a typical progressive resistance training protocol based on 12-repetition maximum. No additional training or expertise beyond what would be available in usual care seems to be required.

Flexibility (adherence):
Quotes: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants attended 92% of training sessions, with no serious adverse events. At 10 weeks, no differences were detected in walking performance. However, compared with the comparison group PRT demonstrated increased leg press strength (16.8%, SD 4.5), increased reverse leg press strength (29.8%, SD 12.7), and increased muscle endurance of the reverse leg press (38.7%, SD 32.8).&quot;</span>
Reasoning: Adherence to the training sessions was high at 92%, but no measures to enforce or improve adherence are mentioned. The improvements in strength suggest participants adhered well without any additional efforts.
Score: [4]

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Changes in muscle strength were determined by the amount of weight that could be lifted in a single seated leg press (1RM, 1 repetition maximum) and a single reverse leg press (resistance of the combined movement of hip flexion, knee flexion and ankle dorsiflexion) (1RM).

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Adults with MS were recruited through announcements at REVAL rehabilitation research institute (UHasselt), Flemish MS rehabilitation centers and MS Society, and Move-to-Sport. Adults diagnosed with MS were included based on the ability to walk 5 km without rest or use of assistive device.&quot;</span>
<span title='Major quote deviation, possible hallucination. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 26.7%):

Exclusion criteria were reports' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: red'>&quot;Exclusion criteria were reports of cardiovascular contra-indications, logistic problem or Automated segmentation of MRI.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: The eligibility criteria are somewhat stricter than what would be used in usual care, with ability to walk 5km unassisted required. However, the criteria are not overly restrictive, as recruitment was done through typical channels for MS patients. Cardiovascular contraindications and logistical problems would likely also preclude participation in a regular walking program.

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Adults with MS were recruited through announcements at REVAL rehabilitation research institute (UHasselt), Flemish MS rehabilitation centers and MS Society, and Move-to-Sport.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: Recruitment was done through typical channels like MS rehabilitation centers and societies that would be used in usual care. No additional efforts like targeted invitations or incentives are mentioned.
Score: [5]  

Setting:
Quotes: No relevant quotes. The setting of the intervention is not clearly described.
Reasoning: There is insufficient information provided about the setting of the trial and how it compares to the usual care setting. It's unclear if it was conducted only at specialized centers or in community settings.

Participants who completed the training program showed high adherence. The EXP group completed 607 of 648 prescribed sessions (94%). In all, 25 of 41 missed training sessions were related to trainingrelated complaints, such as repetitive strain injury of the ankle (n = 2; 9 sessions), training-related fatigue (n = 2; 7 sessions), hip and groin pain (n = 1; 6 sessions), and calf muscle strain (n = 1; 3 sessions). The remaining missed sessions were caused by external factors such as work, holiday, and flu.' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;Participants who completed the training program showed high adherence. The EXP group completed 607 of 648 prescribed sessions (94%). In all, 25 of 41 missed training sessions were related to training-related complaints, such as repetitive strain injury of the ankle (n=2; 9 sessions), training-related fatigue (n=2; 7 sessions), hip and groin pain (n=1; 6 sessions), and calf muscle strain (n=1; 3 sessions). The remaining missed sessions were caused by external factors such as work, holiday, and flu.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: The experimental group received individualized training instructions to carry out in their community, which is similar to what would be done in usual care. However, the high adherence rates of 94% suggest there may have been more supervision and resources used compared to usual care to achieve this adherence. The details are a bit lacking to determine how much additional organization was involved.

Reasoning: Participants received individualized training instructions but carried them out on their own in the community, allowing for some flexibility in delivery. However, the 3x/week frequency and goal of a training event participation suggest the program was still reasonably structured. More details would be needed on how strictly the training was monitored and if there was flexibility in co-interventions.

VO2max improved by 1.5 mL/kg/min, MSWS-12 by 4, FSMC by 11, and MSIS-29 by 14 points. The Spatial Recall Test improved by more than 10%.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: Several physical and cognitive tests were performed at baseline and post-intervention. This is more extensive data collection than would typically occur in usual care, but not dramatically so. The tests appear to be validated clinical measures rather than extensive physiological assessments.

Primary outcome:
Quotes:
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Aerobic capacity was assessed on an electronically braked cycle ergometer (eBike Basic®; General Electric GmbH, Bitz, Germany) with continuous pulmonary gas exchange analysis (Oxycon, Erich Jaeger GmbH, Germany), and heart rate (HR) monitoring (Polar®). Oxygen uptake (VO2), expiratory volume, and respiratory exchange ratio were collected breath-by-breath and averaged every minute.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: The primary outcome of aerobic capacity measured by VO2max is relevant to participants' functional abilities. The eBike system and pulmonary gas exchange analysis is not part of usual care, but VO2max itself is a clinically meaningful measure.
Score: [3]

Primary analysis:
Quotes: No relevant quotes. The approach to missing data and adherence to the protocol in the primary analysis is not described.
Reasoning: There is insufficient information provided on the extent to which the primary analysis included all participants as randomized (intention-to-treat) vs a per-protocol analysis, and how missing data was handled.

<pre>
Eligibility:
Quotes: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Clients were provided with information about the clinic by the local chapter of the Multiple Sclerosis Society, and self selected on that basis.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: The participants were self-selected from a specific multiple sclerosis clinic population. While this represents the typical population that would receive the intervention, the self-selection aspect makes the eligibility criteria slightly more stringent than what would be expected in usual care.
Score: [4]

Recruitment:
Quotes: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Clients attending the clinic were interviewed, and their case histories recorded. The research project was explained, and written informed consent was obtained.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: Participants were recruited through usual clinic visits, which is similar to how recruitment would occur in usual care. However, the additional step of explaining the research project and obtaining written informed consent adds some extra effort beyond usual care recruitment.
Score: [4]

Setting:
Quotes: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants were clients seen in the multiple sclerosis clinics at Sutherland-Chan School, in which the study was conducted.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: The study was conducted in a specific multiple sclerosis clinic setting. While this likely represents the typical setting where the intervention would be delivered, conducting the study in a single center makes the setting slightly less generalizable compared to the range of settings in usual care.
Score: [4]  

Organization:
Quotes: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The inclusion criterion for the study was a diagnosis of multiple sclerosis, and therefore the spectrum of clinical presentations was broad, as would be expected in this client population.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: The study aimed to include the typical spectrum of multiple sclerosis presentations that would be seen in usual care. No additional organizational resources or expertise beyond what is available in usual care were described.
Score: [5]

Flexibility (delivery):
Quotes: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The decision as to the length of the treatment series was pragmatic and related to the length of the students' specialty clinic rotations, which are scheduled over an eight week period.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: Treatment duration was determined pragmatically based on the clinic's usual student rotation schedule, not by a strict study protocol. This suggests flexibility in intervention delivery that is similar to usual care.
Score: [5]

Flexibility (adherence):
Quotes: No relevant quotes identified. The study did not report any measures of participant adherence.
Score: [NA]

Follow-up:
Quotes: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The MSSE survey was originally developed and validated by Schwartz et al. (1996), based on the work of Lorig et al. (1989), who created a similar tool for use with people suffering from arthritis.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: A validated self-efficacy survey was used to assess outcomes. The survey appears to be one that could feasibly be used in usual care follow-up for this population. No additional follow-up visits or assessments beyond what would be typical in usual care were described.
Score: [4]

Primary outcome:
Quotes: <span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 99.7%):

The outcome measures for the current research were the scores yielded by the Multiple Sclerosis Self Efficacy (MSSE) survey.

Reasoning: Self-efficacy, assessed using a validated survey at multiple relevant timepoints, is an outcome that is likely to be important to multiple sclerosis patients. The outcome and its measurement appear consistent with what could be collected in usual care.
Score: [5]

Primary analysis:
Quotes: <span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 99.7%):

Reasoning: The primary outcome assessment occurred at 36 weeks, a longer follow-up period than might be typical in usual care. An economic assessment was also conducted, which goes beyond usual care follow-up. However, many of the clinical assessments were typical of routine care for MS patients.

Reasoning: The AMCA score is a measure of motor function that appears to be commonly used and relevant for MS patients, but may not be routinely assessed in all usual care settings. It represents a reasonably pragmatic choice of primary outcome, but not completely aligned with usual care.

Reasoning: The primary analysis used a modified intention-to-treat approach, which excluded a small number of patients who were deemed ineligible after randomization or missing both baseline and 36-week data. This is a largely pragmatic approach, although not as pragmatic as a full intention-to-treat including all randomized participants. Adjustments were made for baseline scores, but this seems reasonable to increase precision.

Eligibility:
Quotes: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Eligible participants were over 18 years of age and had a diagnosis of MS that was confirmed by a consultant physician or neurologist. Persons with MS were excluded if they had a previous relapse or began steroid therapy in the 12 weeks prior to participating in the first assessment, were pregnant, or had a comorbidity that severely impacted their ability to safely participate in exercise.&quot;</span>
The eligibility criteria are somewhat stricter than what would be used in usual care, with several exclusion criteria that may not be applied in routine practice like excluding those with recent relapses, pregnancy, or severe comorbidities. However, the included population still seems fairly representative of typical MS patients.
Score: [3]

Recruitment:

Recruitment was done through the regional offices of Multiple Sclerosis Ireland, which seems similar to how participants would be recruited for such an intervention in usual care. No additional efforts beyond what would be typical appear to have been made.
Score: [4]

Setting:

The intervention was delivered in community-based settings like gyms, hotels and health centers. This closely matches where such an exercise intervention would take place in usual care practice.
Score: [5]

Organization:
Quotes: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;All interventions took place in groups of eight, for an hour per week, for 10 weeks. They were delivered in community centres such as local gyms, hotels and health centres. Participants were randomised to a physiotherapist (PT)-led class, fitness instructor (FI)-led class, yoga class (Y) or to the control group (CG). The CG was asked not to change their exercise habit for the 10-week period between assessments.&quot;</span>
The organization of the intervention, with group classes led by physiotherapists or fitness instructors, appears to match what would be available under usual care conditions. The control group was asked not to change their usual habits, which also fits with a pragmatic usual care comparator.
Score: [4]

Flexibility (delivery):
Quotes: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The PT-led exercise provided was pre-defined. It consisted of a circuit-style class of exercises that were either resisted by body weight or by the addition of free weights. The exercises were to sit to stand/squat, bridging, resisted shoulder flexion, walking/cycling, resisted elbow flexion, lunges or resisted knee extension, hip extension and calf raises; working to an intensity whereby the aim was to be failing on the 12th repetition of the exercise, with the load increased by 2–5%, when 12 repetitions were achieved with ease.&quot;</span>
The PT-led intervention had a pre-defined circuit of exercises, but allowed some flexibility in the resistance and repetitions to tailor intensity to the individual. This represents an intermediate level of flexibility in delivery, balancing protocol adherence with some ability to individualize.
Score: [3]

Flexibility (adherence):
Quotes: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The yoga intervention was also not predefined, and detailed descriptions of the classes were gathered by nine of the instructors. Seven out of the nine instructors who returned details on the intervention commenced the class with breathing exercises, relaxation or 'body centering.'&quot;</span>
Participant adherence flexibility is not explicitly discussed. The description of the yoga intervention suggests it was not pre-defined and had some inherent variability between instructors, but adherence and its flexibility is not clearly described.
Score: [NA] 

Follow-up:
Quotes: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Outcome was assessed at week 24 for the intervention groups only, as it was felt that withholding a potentially beneficial treatment for longer than 12 weeks, from the controls, could be considered unethical. As all groups were not treated similarly between weeks 12 and 24, and due to the high attrition rates at weeks 12 and 24, the results of our follow-up phase will be presented in a separate paper.&quot;</span>
The control group was only followed through 12 weeks, as longer follow-up was considered unethical. The intervention groups had follow-up at 24 weeks. This shorter follow-up for the control group is less pragmatic, as is the lack of long-term follow-up data on all participants.

The primary analysis looked at all three intervention groups combined compared to control. Secondary analyses looked at each intervention individually vs control. While the analytic approach is not described in detail, it appears to utilize an intent-to-treat approach with all available data.

The trial compared alemtuzumab to an active control (interferon-β-1a) in patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis who had an inadequate response to prior therapy. While some exclusion criteria were applied, the patient population appears to be fairly representative of the types of MS patients who would receive alemtuzumab in usual care. The trial was not overly selective.

The trial used alemtuzumab, which requires intravenous administration by trained staff. This suggests the trial provided additional training and resources beyond what is typical in usual MS care to administer the intervention. Interferon-β-1a was administered subcutaneously, which is more consistent with usual care.

The primary disability outcomes of EDSS, MSFC, and SLCLA are clinically relevant to MS patients. CDI (confirmed disability improvement) was defined as meaningful EDSS changes maintained over time.

<pre>
Eligibility:
Quotes: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;We examined effects of a mindfulness-based intervention (MBI) compared to usual care (UC) upon HRQOL, depression, and fatigue among adults with relapsing-remitting or secondary progressive MS.&quot;</span>
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;A total of 150 patients were randomly assigned to the intervention (n = 76) or to UC (n = 74).&quot;</span>
Reasoning: The study included patients with relapsing-remitting or secondary progressive MS, which represents a fairly broad and representative sample of MS patients. However, some exclusion criteria were applied, such as excluding those refusing to participate or with other reasons. Overall, the eligibility criteria seem moderately pragmatic, but not as broad as what would be seen in usual care.
Score: [3]

Recruitment:
Quotes: No specific quotes related to recruitment methods.
Reasoning: The full text does not provide details on the recruitment methods used in this trial, such as whether recruitment was done through usual clinic visits or if more extensive targeted methods were used. Without this information, the recruitment domain cannot be properly assessed.
Score: [NA] 

Setting:
Quotes: No specific quotes describing the trial setting.
Reasoning: The article does not specify the exact setting in which the trial was conducted, such as whether it was limited to a single center or included multiple centers representative of usual care settings. Lack of details on the trial setting precludes assessment of this PRECIS-2 domain.
Score: [NA]

Organization:
Quotes: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;MBI consisted of a structured 8-week program of mindfulness training.&quot;</span>
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;MBI closely followed the program of mindfulness-based stress reduction and included 1) a personal intake interview to define realistic goals of participants and establish personal rapport; 2) 8 weekly 2.5-hour classes in mindfulness practices (10–15 participants/group; exercises did not exceed patients' level of functioning); 3) one Saturday, 7-hour session at week 6; 4) homework assignments (approximately 40 minutes/day); emphasized as essential to success of the program; 5) a postintervention interview to evaluate personal experiences, goal attainment, and future maintenance of acquired skills.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: The mindfulness intervention involved an 8-week structured program with 2.5 hour weekly sessions, a full-day session, and 40 minutes/day of homework. Specialized training of instructors is implied. This represents a greater level of organization and resources than what would likely be available in usual care.
Score: [2]

Flexibility (delivery):
Quotes: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;MBI closely followed the program of mindfulness-based stress reduction and included 1) a personal intake interview to define realistic goals of participants and establish personal rapport; 2) 8 weekly 2.5-hour classes in mindfulness practices (10–15 participants/group; exercises did not exceed patients' level of functioning); 3) one Saturday, 7-hour session at week 6; 4) homework assignments (approximately 40 minutes/day); emphasized as essential to success of the program; 5) a postintervention interview to evaluate personal experiences, goal attainment, and future maintenance of acquired skills.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: The MBI intervention followed a structured program with defined number and length of sessions. Homework assignments of 40 min/day were considered essential. This suggests a fairly strict, inflexible intervention protocol, although some tailoring to patients' functioning is mentioned. Overall the delivery flexibility appears quite limited.
Score: [2]

Flexibility (adherence):
Quotes: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Homework assignments (approximately 40 minutes/day); emphasized as essential to success of the program&quot;</span>
Reasoning: Participants were expected to adhere to the 40 minutes per day homework assignments, which were considered essential to the program's success. This indicates that a fairly strict level of adherence was expected from participants, more than would be typical in usual care.
Score: [2]

Follow-up:
Quotes: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Assessments were made at baseline, postintervention, and 6 months follow-up.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: Follow-up assessments were conducted post-intervention and at 6 months. This represents a moderately intensive follow-up schedule, more than would be done in usual care, but less burdensome than some explanatory trials. The 6-month duration is likely longer than typical follow-up in usual care.
Score: [3]

Primary outcome:
Quotes: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Primary outcomes included disease-specific and disease-aspecific HRQOL, depression, and fatigue.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: The primary outcomes of disease-specific and general HRQOL, depression and fatigue are likely to be meaningful and directly relevant to patients. These outcomes do not appear to require specialized assessment not typical of usual care.

eighty-one patients with chronic stroke, traumatic brain injury (tBI) and multiple sclerosis (MS) were recruited; 50 out of 81 received 1 month of H-caD intervention, with one training session a day lasting 30 minutes for 5 days a week.' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;Eighty-one patients with chronic stroke, traumatic brain injury (TBI) and multiple sclerosis (MS) were recruited; 50 out of 81 received one month of H-CAD intervention, with one training session a day lasting 30 minutes for 5 days a week.&quot;</span>
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The hypothesis is that the H-CAD system is at least as effective as the usual care for arm/hand function, measured with outcome measures for arm/hand function, given to the stroke, TBI and MS patients when they are living at home.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: The trial included a broad range of patients with stroke, TBI, and MS, which is similar to the patient population that would receive this intervention in usual care. However, the trial still had some exclusion criteria (e.g. excluding those who couldn't participate in the study assessments). Overall, the eligibility criteria were fairly pragmatic but not identical to usual care.
Score: [4]

Recruitment:
Quotes: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Patients were recruited from Unità Organica di Riabilitazione Intensiva Neuromotoria (UORIN, Italy), Foundation Institute Guttmann (FPING, Spain) and from National Multiple Sclerosis Centre (NMSC, Belgium).&quot;</span>
Reasoning: Patients were recruited from rehabilitation centers in multiple countries. This recruitment approach is more targeted than recruiting through usual care appointments, but still fairly pragmatic as it involves real-world clinical settings where these patients would typically be treated. It's not clear if any additional recruitment efforts beyond usual care were made.

Reasoning: The H-CAD system is designed as a tele-rehabilitation service that can be used at home with remote supervision from clinicians. This matches how the organization of the intervention would be in usual care, without requiring additional staff, resources, or changes to the care delivery process.

Reasoning: The delivery of the H-CAD intervention allowed for some flexibility, as it involved practicing a variety of different functional exercises. However, the exercises were still standardized and consistent with the H-CAD system protocol. The flexibility appears to be similar to what would be expected in usual care tele-rehabilitation.
Score: [4]

Flexibility (adherence):
Quotes: No relevant quotes identified. The study does not discuss flexibility of participant adherence to the H-CAD intervention.
Reasoning: There is insufficient information provided to assess the flexibility of participant adherence to the intervention. The study does not mention anything about this aspect.

Reasoning: The main outcome measures (ARA test and H-CAD system parameters) were collected before and after the 1-month intervention period. This matches typical follow-up intensity for tele-rehabilitation in usual care. No additional unscheduled follow-up visits were mentioned.
Score: [4]

Primary outcome:
Quotes: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The Action Research Arm (ARA) and the Nine Hole Peg Test (NHPT) were used as main outcome measures. They proved the H-CAD system to be at least as effective as usual care.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: The primary outcome measures (ARA and NHPT) assess functional ability of the affected arm, which is directly relevant to stroke, TBI and MS patients. These outcomes are likely to be used in regular care as well. The measures do not require specialized equipment or expertise beyond what's available in usual care.
Score: [5]

Primary analysis:
Quotes: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;A total of 16 stroke patients were included in the study, 30 TBI patients and 35 MS patients. The average time since the start of the diagnosis was 9.9 years (range 1-35 years). Information about inclusion rate and number of patient data available at each measurement moment is presented in Figure 1.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: The primary analysis appears to include all patients with available data at each timepoint, which is a pragmatic approach. There is no mention of excluding patients who did not adhere to the protocol. However, the information provided is limited, so it's not entirely clear if the analysis was a true intention-to-treat with all randomized participants.

The eligibility criteria were quite broad, including patients with various unresolved symptoms, psychosocial concerns, end-of-life issues, progressive illness, or complex needs related to MS. This represents a relatively pragmatic approach, although limiting to a specific geographic area (South East London) and requiring clinician judgment of palliative care needs adds some explanatory elements.

The trial was limited to a single geographic area (South East London), but recruited from multiple clinicians seeing MS patients in that area. This leans more explanatory than recruiting from multiple centers that are representative of a wider usual care setting.

The delivery of palliative care by the PCT appears to be an increase in resources and expertise compared to usual care. Patients in the control group continued usual best practice care. The PCT undertook assessments and provided specialist welfare benefits advice and bereavement support beyond what is likely in usual care.

Interestingly, contrary to initial concerns, input from MS nurses was not lower in the fast-track group—in fact there was a nonsignificant trend for it to be higher.&quot;</span>
There are no details provided on flexibility of the PCT intervention protocol. It seems treatment was recommended after initial assessment, but the degree of flexibility is unclear. Much of the PCT care occurred in patients' homes which suggests some flexibility to adapt to the setting. On balance, there is insufficient information to score this domain.
Score: [NA]

Flexibility (adherence):
The full text does not mention any information about flexibility in how participants could engage with or adhere to the palliative care intervention. This domain does not appear to be applicable, as the intervention was a service provided to patients rather than requiring particular adherence on their part.

Our standardized questionnaires included the Palliative Care Outcome Scale (POS8), 24,25 comprising eight questions on anxiety, patient and carer concerns, and practical needs, each rated 0e4; a single-item POS pain score (rated 0 [best] to 4 [worst]); and caregivers’ burden (using the 12-item version of the Zarit Carer Burden Inventory [ZBI]).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;Our standardized questionnaires included the Palliative Care Outcome Scale (POS-8), comprising eight questions on anxiety, patient and carer concerns, and practical needs, each rated 0–4; a single-item POS pain score (rated 0 [best] to 4 [worst]); and caregivers' burden (using the 12-item version of the Zarit Carer Burden Inventory [ZBI]).&quot;</span>
The primary palliative care outcome measures (POS-8, pain score, caregiver burden) are directly relevant to patients and caregivers. However, using standardized questionnaires and scales represents a more explanatory approach than would typically be captured in routine usual care.
Score: [3]

Primary analysis:
Quotes: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;We planned an intention-to-treat analysis, irrespective of whether patients were assessed as having palliative care needs or the nature of contact with the PCT. We tested the differences between the two arms (expressed as differences between follow-up and baseline interviews) using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), checking statistical assumptions and adjusting for baseline scores. Our primary point of analysis was at 12 weeks (before the control group received the PCT).&quot;</span>
The primary analysis was planned as an intention-to-treat analysis, which is a pragmatic approach that includes all randomized participants regardless of their contact with the intervention. However, the analysis used ANOVA adjusting for baseline scores, which is a more explanatory approach than would be used in usual care settings.

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The study population was low-disability RRMS patients with or without support partner.&quot;</span>

The eligibility criteria are fairly pragmatic, including low-disability RRMS patients diagnosed at least one year ago with EDSS ≤4.0 and no recent relapses. This represents a typical population seen in usual care. However, the requirement for internet access and willingness/capability to participate in investigations is slightly more restrictive than usual care.
Score: [4]

Recruitment:
Quotes: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants were recruited from all over the Netherlands by the patient organisation NMSF, Rotterdam, the Netherlands. Interested patients were contacted by a registered nurse experienced in MS (MH) by phone to check diagnosis and eligibility criteria.&quot;</span>

Recruitment was done through the patient organization NMSF, rather than during usual care appointments. Interested patients were then screened by phone by a study nurse. This represents a more targeted recruitment effort compared to usual care.
Score: [2]

Setting:

The trial was conducted at a single center in the Netherlands. While not explicitly stated, this appears to be an academic or specialized center rather than a usual care community setting.
Score: [2] 

Organization:
Quotes: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The multidisciplinary team included a psychiatrist, psychiatric nurse, neurologist, registered nurse specialized in MS, physiotherapist, dance therapist, and a person with MS [9]. All professional team members were formally trained in their respective disciplines and all members were experienced in the field of MS.&quot;</span>
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The person with MS had experience with chronic symptoms and multiple disease-modifying treatments. As the team members were also involved in the preceding observational study—except for the dance therapist-, the team was experienced in providing CDT [9].&quot;</span>

The multidisciplinary team providing the intervention included specialists that would not typically be available in usual care for MS, such as a psychiatrist, psychiatric nurse, dance therapist, etc. The team members had specific experience in MS and the CDT intervention from a prior observational study. This represents a higher level of expertise and training than would be available in usual care.

Flexibility (delivery):
Quotes: <span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 97.5%):

CDT is a social cognitive theory-based intervention aiming to uncover and promote existing capabilities, with the notion ‘stressor’ as central concept [9]. CDT is based on the identification and reduction of stressors; client-centeredness; potential inclusion of partner or another significant informal caregiver; group sessions; and self-reliance, autonomy and acceptance as central themes [9]. CDT focuses on the exploration of those stressors that confine patients to their physical, psychological or social roles regarding their disease and limitations; reduces relevant stressors; explores and pushes personal boundaries; and creates new personal boundaries by making optimal use of the existing potential [9].' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;CDT is a social cognitive theory-based intervention aiming to uncover and promote existing capabilities, with the notion 'stressor' as central concept [9].

CDT focuses on the exploration of those stressors that confine patients to their physical, psychological or social roles regarding their disease and limitations; reduces relevant stressors; explores and pushes personal boundaries by making optimal use of the existing potential [9].&quot;</span>

The intervention has a structured protocol based on social cognitive theory principles. While some tailoring to the individual is mentioned, such as identifying personal stressors and boundaries, overall the delivery appears to be fairly standardized without much flexibility. No discussion of allowed co-interventions or management of complications.

Primary endpoint was control self-efficacy (Multiple Sclerosis Self-Efficacy Scale Control [MSSES-C] (minimum 90, maximum 900) at six months.&quot;</span>

Follow-up assessments were conducted at 1, 3 and 6 months, with the primary endpoint at 6 months. This schedule is more frequent than typical follow-up for low-disability RRMS patients in usual care. No unscheduled visits are mentioned.
Score: [2]

Primary outcome:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The primary study outcome was the change in control self-efficacy, assessed by the Multiple Sclerosis Self-Efficacy Scale (MSSES), at six months [12]. The MSSES is a specific and sensitive self-report questionnaire consisting of two 9-items subscales for control and functional self-efficacy, with a high internal consistency and test-retest reliability [12].&quot;</span>

The primary outcome is self-efficacy, assessed using the Multiple Sclerosis Self-Efficacy Scale (MSSES), a patient-reported outcome measure. This is relevant to participants and does not require assessment expertise beyond usual care. However, self-efficacy is a more indirect outcome compared to clinical measures of disability or disease activity that would be used in usual care.

The primary analysis looked at between-group differences in MSSES-C scores at 6 months. A multiple regression analysis adjusting for baseline variables was also performed. Missing data and approach for handling missing data are not discussed. It's unclear if the analysis was intention-to-treat or per-protocol. 57% of CDT and 46% of control patients were analyzed as having improvement in self-efficacy.

Quotes:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Inclusion criteria were: 1) having a definite diagnosis of MS from a neurologist; 2) being within 5 years of receiving a diagnosis of MS; 3) scoring at least 10 on the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) [26]; 4) not currently undertaking other psychological treatment for depressive or anxiety symptoms for the length of participation in the current trial; 5) speak English fluently; 6) no current or lifetime diagnosis of psychosis; 7) no current substance dependency; 8) no gross cognitive impairment; and 9) no changes to medications prior and during involvement in the trial.&quot;</span>

The eligibility criteria are somewhat stricter than what would be used in usual care, with several exclusions like no current substance dependency, no gross cognitive impairment, and no changes to medications. However, the criteria are not overly restrictive, allowing individuals with a definite MS diagnosis within 5 years who have at least mild depression. On balance, the eligibility criteria are moderately pragmatic.

Recruitment:
Quotes:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The study took place at a large teaching and research hospital in Melbourne, Australia. Participants were recruited through neurologists working in a large MS outpatient clinic at the hospital, advertisements on MS related websites and local press releases.&quot;</span>

Recruitment occurred through a mix of usual care pathways (neurologists working in an MS clinic) and more targeted approaches (advertisements and press releases). This goes slightly beyond what would typically be done in usual care, but not excessively so. The recruitment methods are moderately pragmatic.

Flexibility (delivery):
Quotes:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The aim of the 8-week tailored intervention is to significantly decrease level of depressive symptoms (primary outcome), anxiety, fatigue and pain impact and to contribute to improvements in levels of quality of life, sleep difficulties, MS illness acceptance, active coping skills, social support and resilience (secondary outcomes) in those newly diagnosed with MS.&quot;</span>
2. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The CBT intervention consisted of 8 individual modules which focused on CBT based principles and strategies. These strategies included progressive muscle relaxation, controlled breathing exercises, pleasant activity scheduling, problem solving skills, cognitive exercises which helped individuals identify, challenge and manage unhelpful thoughts and beliefs.&quot;</span>

The intervention had a clear aim and involved delivery of 8 individual CBT-based modules covering a range of strategies. This suggests a moderately structured protocol, but with some flexibility to tailor the modules and strategies to each participant. The delivery flexibility is moderately pragmatic.

The trial had some exclusion criteria related to recent MS exacerbations and medical conditions that could prevent exercise participation. However, the criteria seem reasonable and not overly restrictive compared to what would be used in usual care for this population. The trial aimed to include a representative sample of people with moderate MS.
Score: [4]

Recruitment:
Quotes: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Of the 873 patients on the clinical register for multiple sclerosis 159 patients were deemed suitable for the study. These people were sent invitation letters and participant information sheets. Forty-three potential participants expressed an interest in participating.&quot;</span>
Recruitment was done by sending invitation letters to potentially eligible participants identified from a clinical register. This is a bit more effort than would be used in usual care, but still a relatively pragmatic approach, as the letters were sent to people already on a register, not requiring additional screening or advertising.
Score: [4]

Setting:
Quotes: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Two community leisure centres.&quot;</span>
The intervention was delivered in two community leisure centres, which is likely very similar to the setting in which such an exercise intervention would be delivered as part of usual care.

The control group received usual care.&quot;</span>
The organization of the intervention seems quite different from usual care, with specialized 60-minute group exercise sessions twice a week, including mobility, balance and resistance components. Usual care would likely not include such an intensive program.

Flexibility (delivery):
Quotes: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants assigned to the intervention group attended a leisure centre-based exercise class, twice weekly for 12 weeks. Each group was led by two instructors (one physiotherapist and one fitness instructor). The same physiotherapist was present at both sites; however fitness instructors were different between sites.&quot;</span>
The intervention followed a defined 12-week protocol of twice weekly classes led by both a physiotherapist and fitness instructor. While there was likely some inherent flexibility, the overall program seems to be have been delivered in a reasonably structured and consistent way across the two sites.

Participant attendance at the exercise classes was recorded. The authors compared their 71% attendance rate to the >80% attendance in other similar studies, suggesting that they were tracking and aiming for a high degree of adherence to the twice weekly sessions. However, no explicit adherence-improving strategies were mentioned.

Outcome assessments were conducted at the hospital at baseline, 8 weeks and 12 weeks. This follow-up is more intense than would be typical in usual care, especially with the primary outcome being a timed walking test that requires in-person assessment. However, the timing of follow-up at 8 and 12 weeks is not too far off from what might be done in usual care.

The primary outcome was walking speed as measured by the Timed 25-Foot Walk Test. This is a performance measure that is relevant to patients and can be conducted relatively quickly. It is part of a standard MS disability assessment. While it requires in-person evaluation, overall it is a reasonably pragmatic and patient-centered primary outcome.

The primary analysis is not described in detail, but appears to be a standard ANOVA that included all participants. Some mentions are made of participants missing classes for various reasons, but it does not appear any were excluded from the analysis, suggesting an intent-to-treat approach. However, without more details on handling of missing data, the exact analysis approach cannot be confirmed.

Eligibility:
Quotes: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Specific inclusion criteria were (1) ambulatory (can walk 100 m, be capable of walking 100 metres without a walking aid corresponding to a classification of ⩽5.5 on the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS),10 even if they do use an aid for daily activities; and (2) self-reported to be sedentary or irregularly active at time of study entry (i.e. do not exercise 30 minutes or more twice per week of moderate to vigorous activity).&quot;</span>
The eligibility criteria are quite specific, requiring participants to be ambulatory with EDSS score ≤5.5, and sedentary or irregularly active. This is more restrictive than what would be typical in usual care for people with multiple sclerosis.
Score: [2]

Recruitment:
Quotes: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;People were recruited from four multiple sclerosis clinics in three Canadian cities and from posting on media sites. During the clinic visit, the treating neurologist introduced the study to their patients and referred them to the research assistant who further explained the study and assessed eligibility.&quot;</span>
Recruitment was done through multiple sclerosis clinics and media sites, with neurologists introducing the study to patients. This is somewhat different from how recruitment would occur in usual care.
Score: [3]

Setting:
Quotes: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The target population was community dwelling individuals aged 19 to 65 who have been diagnosed after 1994 with multiple sclerosis.&quot;</span>
The study was conducted in a community setting with participants living at home, which matches the setting of usual care for this population.

Organization:
Quotes: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Two different types of exercise interventions were contrasted. MSTEP©, a personally adapted exercise regimen including a variety of exercises targeting endurance, muscular, and core strength, balance, flexibility, muscular power, and speed of movement. The goal of the MSTEP© programme is to promote regular bouts of activity most days per week, encouraging a balance between rest and activity, and taking into consideration the physical and emotional status and capacity of the person.&quot;</span>
The MSTEP intervention involved a personalized, multimodal exercise program delivered by exercise therapists or instructors. This required extra training and resources compared to what would be available in usual care.
Score: [2]

Flexibility (delivery):
Quotes: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;On Push Days, participants were instructed to do short bursts of moderate-high intensity exercise to their own tolerance (e.g. for 1–3 minutes) and then reduce to a more comfortable pace for 5–7 minutes and repeat as they are possible. Supplementary Material Tables 4S and 5S present the specifics of the MSTEP© programme.&quot;</span>
The MSTEP intervention followed a specific protocol in terms of exercise types, intensity, and progression. However, it allowed flexibility for participants to exercise according to their own tolerance. This represents a balance between explanatory and pragmatic approaches.
Score: [3]

Flexibility (adherence):
Quotes: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;All participants were contacted every two weeks during the first two months, then monthly thereafter by the exercise instructor by telephone or email for follow-up by the instructor. The purpose of follow-up contacts is to provide an opportunity to ask any questions they have and also to facilitate long-term retention in the study.&quot;</span>
Participants received regular follow-up contacts from the exercise instructor to encourage adherence and retention. However, there is no mention of any measures taken to strictly enforce or monitor adherence.

Reasoning: The trial included participants with moderate to severe MS, with EDSS scores between 6.5 and 8. This represents a moderately pragmatic approach, as it includes a specific subgroup of MS patients rather than all MS patients that would be seen in usual care. However, the EDSS range of 6.5-8 is still fairly broad and likely represents the typical MS patients that would be treated with physiotherapy in practice.

Reasoning: Recruitment was done by sending invitation letters to potential participants identified from a database. This deviates from how patients would typically present for treatment in usual care, as it involves active outreach and recruitment efforts. However, the recruitment was still done from a population of patients with MS, likely identified through medical records or MS society databases, which is more pragmatic than recruitment using media advertisements or other more explanatory methods.

Reasoning: The physiotherapy intervention allowed the treating therapist to develop an individualized program for each participant, which was reviewed and adjusted at assessments throughout the trial. This suggests a moderately flexible approach to intervention delivery, allowing the therapist to tailor the treatment to the individual. However, the 60 minute session length was specified.

Primary outcome measure: Multiple Sclerosis Impact Scale (MSIS29) and secondary outcome measures assessed physical impairment, MS symptoms, quality of life, mood, and disability.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: Follow-up assessments were conducted at 8 weeks (immediately post-intervention) and at 16 weeks. This represents a typical follow-up schedule for evaluating the effects of a short-term physiotherapy program, and does not involve more frequent or extensive follow-up than would be expected in usual care. The outcome measures are questionnaires and assessments that would be feasible to implement in usual care.

Inclusion criteria were: having MS (MacDonald criteria); being able to complete a questionnaire; and being in need for a multidisciplinary approach, defined by the requirement, in addition to the neurology specialist, of at least two different medical (rehabilitation specialist, neuro-urology specialist, psychiatrist) or allied health professionals (physiotherapist, occupational therapist, social worker, psychologist, and neuropsychologist).&quot;</span>
Reasoning: The eligibility criteria are somewhat stricter than what would be used in usual care, requiring patients to have MS, be able to complete a questionnaire, need a multidisciplinary approach, and require at least two different medical or allied health professionals. However, the criteria are not overly strict and would likely capture a majority of MS patients needing multidisciplinary care.

Reasoning: Patients were recruited prospectively from the outpatient clinic of the hospital's neurology department. This is a very pragmatic approach that mirrors how patients would be recruited in usual care, without any extra effort or routes that would not normally be used.
Score: [5]

Setting:
Quotes: No relevant quotes identified. The study appears to have taken place at a single hospital (Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital).
Reasoning: The trial seems to have been conducted at a single hospital. While this is likely a typical setting where MS patients would receive multidisciplinary care, the use of only a single center is more explanatory than recruiting across multiple centers that patients usually visit.

For patients in the control group, interventions with the different health professionals were planned after the inclusion visit, with an explanatory letter given to the patient or directly sent to the professionals. In most cases the same health professionals were in charge of the two groups.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: The organization appears largely similar to usual care, with a multidisciplinary evaluation and discussion of therapeutic propositions with patients and caregivers. Interventions were planned after the visit. The same health professionals cared for both groups. No major differences in resources, expertise or organization compared to usual care are noted.
Score: [4]

Flexibility (delivery):
Quotes: No relevant quotes identified.
Reasoning: There is not enough information provided about the flexibility of intervention delivery compared to usual care. The involvement of the same health professionals in both groups suggests flexibility may have been similar to usual care, but this cannot be determined conclusively.
Score: [NA]

Flexibility (adherence):
Quotes: No relevant quotes identified. 
Reasoning: The trial does not appear to involve any flexibility in participant adherence, as it consisted of a single multidisciplinary evaluation rather than an ongoing intervention that participants needed to adhere to. Therefore, this domain is not applicable.

Median MSIS 29 score decreased over six months in the control group (−4.89) and increased in the IMD group (+2.00), with a significant difference between the two groups (p = 0.03). However, in the multivariate analysis, after adjustment of HAD-D and INTERMED score, this difference was no longer significant.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: Patients were followed up at 6 months and 12 months after the initial multidisciplinary evaluation. This is likely somewhat more intense than the follow-up that would occur in usual care over that timeframe for a multidisciplinary evaluation. However, the follow-up does not appear to be overly burdensome.

Primary outcome:
Quotes: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The primary outcome was the impact of the strategy on quality of life (QoL) measured using the MSIS-29 scale at inclusion and after six months.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: The primary outcome is quality of life measured by the MSIS-29, a patient-reported outcome that is relevant to participants. Using a patient-reported QoL measure is a pragmatic choice. The timepoint of 6 months is somewhat arbitrary but reasonably pragmatic.

Reasoning: The analysis appears to have included all 50 randomized patients (25 per group). There is no mention of excluding any participants from the analysis. This suggests an intention-to-treat approach was likely used, which is pragmatic. However, the lack of clarity on whether the analysis was truly intention-to-treat or per-protocol limits a fully pragmatic score.

Reasoning: The trial recruited participants from a Multiple Sclerosis Service at a rehabilitation center. While this represents the type of patients that would receive the intervention in usual care, there were some restrictions on eligibility like EDSS score 5-6.5. This makes the eligibility criteria somewhat more restrictive than what would be used in usual care.

Flexibility (delivery):
Quotes: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants were given unique log-in details to view their own, online personalised exercise programme.

Reasoning: Participants were advised to complete their exercise program at least twice a week, but no strict measures were taken to improve or enforce adherence. Adherence was monitored remotely by the physiotherapist viewing exercise diaries. This represents flexibility in adherence similar to what would be expected in usual care.

<pre>
Eligibility:
Quotes: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Eligible patients were assessed for suitability by the coordinator of the home based care team (LP). Written informed consent was obtained for entry into the trial from the patients and, when appropriate, from their carers.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: The trial had broad eligibility criteria, with patients assessed for suitability by the home care coordinator. Written informed consent was obtained from patients and carers when appropriate. This suggests the trial included the typical patients seen by the home care service. However, the full eligibility criteria are not provided, so it's unclear how selective or pragmatic the criteria truly were.
Score: [4]

Recruitment:
Quotes: <span title='Moderate quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 85.6%):

Reasoning: Patients were recruited from multiple sclerosis centres when referred for a second opinion, but they continued to be regularly followed by their own neurologists. This represents a pragmatic approach leveraging patients' existing care relationships, rather than active recruitment efforts that differ from routine care.
Score: [4]

Setting:
Quotes: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Rome service area. Eligible patients were assessed for suitability by the coordinator of the home based care team (LP).&quot;</span>
Reasoning: The trial was conducted in the Rome service area, with patients assessed by the home care team coordinator. This suggests the setting was identical to the usual care setting where these patients would typically be managed.
Score: [5]

Organization:
Quotes: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;A minority of refusers (n = 34) did not consent to take part to the study because they were referred to the multiple sclerosis centres only for a second opinion but were regularly followed by their own neurologists.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: Patients continued to be regularly followed by their own neurologists, even if referred to the MS centres for a second opinion. This suggests the organization of care delivery was very similar between the trial and usual care.
Score: [4]

Flexibility (delivery):
Quotes: <span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 98.8%):

Randomisation (in blocks of six) was stratified by age and expanded disability status score (EDSS), 18 because both health outcomes and costs differ according to disease disability and age 5 19 and a valid conclusion can be drawn only by comparing similar patients.' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;Randomisation (in blocks of six) was expanded disability status score (EDSS),14 because both health outcomes and costs differ according to disease disability and age15 16 and a valid conclusion can be drawn only by comparing similar patients.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: Patients were randomized in blocks of six according to EDSS disability status score, to ensure comparable patients between groups. However, the full details of the intervention protocol and any allowed flexibility are not described in detail.
Score: [NA]

Flexibility (adherence):
Quotes: No relevant quotes identified. The intervention involved home visits and did not seem to have any particular compliance issues after consent was given.
Score: [NA]

Follow-up:
Quotes: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Patients were randomised to home (intervention) or hospital care (control) in a ratio of 2:1, in order to ensure that the home care population was sufficiently represented.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: Patients were randomized 2:1 to intervention vs control to ensure sufficient representation of the home care group. However, the intensity and frequency of follow-up visits is not clearly described.
Score: [NA] 

Primary outcome:
Quotes: <span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 99.4%):

Reasoning: The primary outcomes were costs of patient care, estimated based on Italian DRG reimbursement rates as a proxy for real costs. These economic outcomes are relevant to payers but may be less directly meaningful to patients.
Score: [3]

Primary analysis:

The trial had some exclusion criteria like requiring participants to have persistent foot drop for over 3 months and screening them for eligibility prior to randomization. However, the criteria seem fairly broad overall, only requiring treatment-naïve MS patients with persistent foot drop.
Score: [3]

Recruitment:
Quotes: No relevant quotes identified.
The full text does not provide details on the recruitment methods used in the trial or how they compare to usual care recruitment. There is not enough information to assess this domain.
Score: [NA]

Setting:
Quotes: <span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 95.5%):

The trial took place across seven MS outpatient centers in Scotland. While not explicitly stated, this seems to match a usual care setting for this population. Conducting the trial across multiple standard clinical sites suggests a pragmatic approach.
Score: [4]

Organization:
Quotes: No relevant quotes identified.
The full text lacks details on how the organization of care delivery in the trial compares to usual care. There is insufficient information to evaluate this domain.
Score: [NA] 

Flexibility (delivery):
Quotes: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants in both groups were instructed to gradually increase the wear of their devices over the first six weeks.&quot;</span> <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The current amplitude ranged from 7 to 72 mA (mean = 40 mA). Participants in both groups were instructed to gradually increase the wear of their devices over the first six weeks.&quot;</span>
Participants were instructed to gradually increase device usage over the first six weeks, but few other details are provided on flexibility of intervention delivery. The amplitude range allowed some tailoring. Overall, the delivery appears to be somewhat protocol-driven but not highly rigid.
Score: [3]

Flexibility (adherence):
Quotes: <span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 98.9%):

Eightyfive participants were recruited allowing for an approximate 15% attrition rate.' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;Eighty-five participants were recruited allowing for an approximate 15% attrition rate.&quot;</span>
Recruiting additional participants to allow for 15% attrition suggests that the trial had a somewhat pragmatic approach to adherence, not employing strict adherence measures or excluding non-adherent participants. However, the text provides limited details to fully assess flexibility of adherence expected.
Score: [4]

Follow-up:
Quotes: <span title='Major quote deviation, possible hallucination. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 47.6%):

Participants walked twice, once with their device and once without,' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: red'>&quot;Participants walked twice, once with their device and once without, at weeks 0, 3, 6 and 12 months; 5-minute self-selected walk test (primary).&quot;</span> <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The order of testing was randomized between participants but was kept consistent for each participant throughout the trial.&quot;</span>
Participants underwent assessments with a 5-minute walk test at baseline and 3, 6, and 12 months. This schedule is more frequent than typical follow-up in usual care. However, the 5-minute test itself is not particularly burdensome. The follow-up is therefore somewhat more intensive than usual care but not excessively so.
Score: [3]

Primary outcome:
Quotes: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The primary outcome was walking speed as measured by the 5-minute self-selected walk test.&quot;</span> <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;A minimum of 37 participants were required to detect a change of at least 75% of 1 standard deviation value (0.16 m/s) to achieve a power of 90% at a 5% level of significance.&quot;</span>
Walking speed measured by a 5-minute self-selected walk test appears to be a clinically meaningful and patient-centered outcome. The outcome itself is relevant to participants. However, the test may be administered in a more structured manner than done in routine practice.

The trial recruited 85 participants to allow for 15% attrition, suggesting that the primary analysis likely included most participants. However, it is not explicitly stated that an intention-to-treat approach analyzing all randomized participants was used. More details would be needed to determine how pragmatic the analysis was.

Reasoning: The trial included adults with severe MS and their carers, which is likely similar to the population that would receive this intervention as part of usual care. However, the trial also involved a multi-professional team delivering the intervention and blind examiners assessing participants, which may differ from usual care.
Score: [3]

Recruitment:
Quotes: No relevant quotes identified.
Reasoning: The full text does not provide details on how participants were recruited for the trial, such as whether recruitment was done through usual appointments/clinics or if extra effort like invitation letters or advertising was used. There is insufficient information to assess how pragmatic or explanatory the recruitment was compared to usual care.

Reasoning: The trial was conducted in multiple centers and involved a home-based intervention, which suggests the setting may be similar to usual care. However, without more details on the specific centers involved, it is difficult to determine if they are identical to the usual care setting or if some may be more specialized trial centers.

Reasoning: The intervention involved a multi-professional team delivering home visits, which likely requires greater staff expertise and resources than what is typically available in usual care. The number and frequency of visits from various health professionals also suggests the organization of care delivery in the intervention arm differs from usual care.

Reasoning: The intervention followed defined principles of palliative care and involved a specified team composition and some training, suggesting a less flexible delivery than usual care. However, the extent of flexibility in the delivery is not fully clear from the information provided.
Score: [3]

Flexibility (adherence):

<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Mean change in POS-S-MS score from baseline to 3 months was 1.1 (95% confidence interval (CI), −0.5 to 2.7) in the HPA group and −0.2 (95% CI, −2.9 to 2.6) in the UC group, with a mean between-group difference of 1.3 (95% CI, −1.7 to 4.2), and a Cohen's d effect size (ES) of 0.20.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: The primary outcomes of POS-S-MS and SEIQoL-DW appear to be relevant to participants, as they measure palliative care symptoms and quality of life. The outcomes are patient-reported and do not seem to require assessment expertise unavailable in usual care. The timing of outcome assessment is not clearly compared to usual care.

Reasoning: 50 out of the 52 randomized dyads were included in the primary analysis. The 2 excluded dyads did not receive the allocated intervention, so this is not a strict intention-to-treat approach. However, the analysis still included a high proportion of the randomized participants.

<pre>
Eligibility:
Quotes:
1) <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants randomised to the CLP arm of the trial received current local practice advice and information provision about MS-fatigue to more detailed individualised management advice from a variety of health professionals.&quot;</span>

Individuals who had attended a fatigue management programme in the past' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: red'>&quot;Individuals who had attended a fatigue management programme in the past 3 months (see protocol col).&quot;</span>
Reasoning: The trial included participants who would likely receive the intervention if it was part of usual care, with only those who recently attended a fatigue management program being excluded. However, some additional eligibility criteria were applied that may differ from usual care.
Score: [4]

Recruitment:
Quotes:
1) <span title='Moderate quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 91.5%):

Patients with MS and significant fatigue were randomised to FACETS or current local practice.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: The trial was conducted in three centers, which is relatively pragmatic and likely similar to the usual care setting for delivering this type of intervention. However, with only three centers involved, there may be some differences compared to the full spectrum of usual care settings.
Score: [4]

Organization:
Quotes:
1) <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The main inclusion criteria were: (1) clinically definite MS diagnosis, (2) fatigue impacting on daily life (Fatigue Severity Scale score >4) and (3) ambulatory. The main exclusion criteria were: (1) having taken part in a fatigue programme in the last year, (2) cognitive impairments, (3) a relapse in the previous 3 months or (4) having started treatment with disease modifying or antidepressant drugs within the previous 3 months.&quot;</span>
2) <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants were recruited in three UK centres (Poole, Bristol, Southampton/Portsmouth) from primary or secondary care, or via MS Society newsletters/websites.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: The trial utilized staff with expertise in delivering the FACETS intervention and had some additional organization compared to usual care, such as the inclusion/exclusion criteria and recruitment from MS Society newsletters/websites. However, the intervention was still integrated within existing healthcare services.
Score: [3]

Flexibility (delivery):

1) <span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 98.6%):

The aim of the intervention is to help people normalise their fatigue experiences, learn helpful ways of thinking about fatigue and use available energy more effectively. The intervention consists of six sessions (∼90 min duration) held weekly and facilitated in groups of 6–12 by two health professionals with experience of working with people with MS and group-work (such as occupational therapists, nurses or physiotherapists).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;The aim of the intervention is to help people normalise their fatigue experiences, learn helpful ways of thinking about fatigue and use their available energy more effectively.

Reasoning: The primary outcome measures of fatigue self-efficacy and fatigue severity were highly relevant to participants. The measures were self-reported using validated scales. This represents a pragmatic approach, although some of the measures like the SF-36 may be less commonly used in usual care.
Score: [4]

Primary analysis:
Quotes:
1) <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The main analysis was intention-to-treat but we also conducted a 'per protocol' analysis (excluding participants who attended fewer than four FACETS sessions).&quot;</span>
Reasoning: The primary analysis was intention-to-treat, which is a pragmatic approach including all randomized participants. A per-protocol analysis was also done as a secondary analysis, but the main inference comes from the pragmatic primary ITT analysis.

The eligibility criteria are somewhat selective, excluding those currently in rehabilitation/therapy, those unable to do PA without risk factors, and those outside the 18-65 age range. However, the participants are still recruited from hospitals where they receive normal MS outpatient services. The criteria strike a balance between explanatory and pragmatic.

The trial required oversight from research ethics committees and a national regulatory agency, which differs from usual care. Measurements were carried out at two timepoints, which may involve more organizational effort than usual. However, the intervention itself was delivered by an internet application, which may not require much additional organization. Overall, the organization has some explanatory elements but is still reasonably close to usual care.

The intervention followed a pre-defined protocol of recorded audio sessions of set lengths. However, participants had flexibility in when they did the sessions each day, and were asked to describe their individual sensations, allowing some tailoring. This represents a balance between explanatory and pragmatic approaches.

Only, three of them dropped out the PA program before the end.&quot;</span>

Participant adherence to the physical activity program was encouraged but not enforced, with 3 of 35 participants dropping out. This flexibility in adherence is reasonably pragmatic, not differing too much from what would be expected in usual care.

Follow-up in the trial occurred at 2 timepoints, baseline and 8 weeks post-intervention. This does not seem to be an overly intensive follow-up schedule beyond what might occur in usual care over an 8 week physical activity program. No unscheduled visits or extensive data collection are mentioned.

Primary outcome:
Quotes:
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy of a PA program compared to two types of psychological interventions – Mindfulness and Implementation Intention – delivered via internet, in reducing consequences of MS. Effects of practicing were unrelated to degree of impairment (i.e., EDSS level).&quot;</span>
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Mobility, fatigue, and the impact of the disease on the patient's life were measured.&quot;</span>

The primary outcomes of mobility, fatigue and impact of MS on patients' lives appear to be important to participants. The measures used (6MWT, MFIS, MSIS-29) are validated instruments that do not require major additional expertise beyond usual MS care. This represents a pragmatic approach.
Score: [4]

Primary analysis:

No relevant quotes identified. The article does not provide details on the statistical analysis methods used.

There is insufficient information provided in the article to determine how pragmatic vs explanatory the primary analysis was, for example whether it used intention-to-treat with all participant data or a more restricted analysis.

We used the following assessment tools and procedures:&quot;</span>
The intervention was delivered by staff at a university medical center, which suggests some additional expertise beyond a typical care setting. However, not enough details are provided on the resources and organization of care to determine how pragmatic or explanatory this domain is.
Score: [NA]

Flexibility (Delivery):
Quotes: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Both programs were held once a week for 10 weeks. Participants were asked to attend at least 9 out of 10 SC or yoga sessions.&quot;</span>
The intervention allowed for participants to miss 1 out of 10 sessions, providing a small amount of flexibility. However, the weekly sessions over 10 weeks is still a fairly rigid schedule compared to usual care.
Score: [2]

Flexibility (Adherence):
The full text does not discuss flexibility of participant adherence to the intervention or if adherence was enforced. There is not enough information provided to score this domain.

For executive function the Mazes subtest of Executive module from the Neuropsychological Assessment battery (NAB) [17] and Tower of London Test (TOL) [18] were used. In the Mazes subtest we measured and evaluated the time for the completion of maze tasks with increasing difficulties.&quot;</span>
The use of a psychologist to administer executive function tests before and after the intervention is more extensive follow-up than would typically occur in usual care. The frequency is not clear but having the same psychologist perform testing suggests it was beyond usual follow-up.
Score: [2]

Primary Outcome:
Quotes: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Objectives: Spasticity, cognitive impairment, depression and fatigue significantly reduce the quality of life in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients. To find out whether nonpharmalogical treatment approaches can reduce these symptoms we investigated effects of sports climbing (SC) and yoga on spasticity, cognitive impairment, mood change and fatigue in MS patients.&quot;</span>
The primary outcomes of spasticity, cognitive function, mood and fatigue are relevant to MS patients. However, some of the measures like the psychologist-administered executive function tests may be less directly meaningful to participants than measures of daily activities or quality of life would be.

Wilcoxon signed ranks test was used to compare the difference before and after each program. Statistical significance was set at p ≤ 0.05.&quot;</span>
The analysis appears to include all participants with before and after data, which suggests an intent-to-treat approach. However, it is not explicitly stated that all randomized participants were included. More details would be needed to confirm a pragmatic approach was used.

<pre>
Eligibility:
Quotes: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;MS patients older than 18 years who had a confirmed MS with spasticity of the lower limbs and an Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS)9 score between 4 and 6.5 were eligible for inclusion. Patients who had received hippotherapy within the last 12 months, a body weight over 90 kg, no balance while sitting, and acute exacerbation during the 4-week period before start of the therapy were excluded.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: The trial had some exclusion criteria like EDSS score range, recent hippotherapy, high body weight, poor balance, and recent exacerbation that differ from the typical MS population receiving hippotherapy in usual care. However, the core eligibility criteria of confirmed MS with lower limb spasticity are similar to the usual care population.
Score: [3]

Recruitment:
Quotes: No relevant quotes identified.
Reasoning: The full text does not provide any details on the recruitment process and how it compares to recruitment for hippotherapy in usual care. There is insufficient information to assess how pragmatic or explanatory the recruitment was.
Score: [NA] 

Setting:
Quotes: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;MS-HIPPO was a prospective, randomized, examiner-blinded, multicenter, comparative trial with an allocation of 1:1 to the two groups: hippotherapy plus standard care compared to standard care alone (as prior to the study). The intervention lasted for 12 weeks.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: The trial was conducted at multiple centers, which is more reflective of usual care than a single center trial. However, no details are provided on the types of centers and how they compare to typical hippotherapy settings. The information is limited but suggests the setting had some pragmatic elements.
Score: [4]

Organization:
Quotes: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Hippotherapy plus standard care, while below the threshold of a minimal clinically important difference, significantly improved balance and also fatigue, spasticity, and quality of life in MS patients.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: The intervention group received hippotherapy plus standard care, which appears to match the typical organization of care for hippotherapy in MS patients. The control group continuing their prior therapy also reflects usual care. No details are provided about any extra organizational resources or training required for the trial.
Score: [4]

Flexibility (delivery):
Quotes: <span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 98.4%):

Hippotherapy as a complementary treatment can be defined as one-patient-one-horse physiotherapy treatment with and on the horse. The primary goals of hippotherapy are regulating muscle tone (reduction in spasticity) and breathing, strengthening the torso muscles, improving balance control and coordination, as well as gait. In addition, hippotherapy promotes social communication in the patients’ lives and strengthens their self-esteem.' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;Hippotherapy as a complementary treatment can be defined as one-patient-one-horse physiotherapy treatment with influence on muscle tone (reduction in spasticity) and breathing, strengthening the torso muscles, improving balance control and coordination, as well as gait. In addition, hippotherapy promotes social communication in the patients' lives and strengthens their self-esteem.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: The description of the hippotherapy intervention is quite general, mentioning its effects on multiple outcomes. No details are provided about a specific intervention protocol or measures to ensure compliance. This suggests the delivery of hippotherapy was flexible and similar to usual care.
Score: [4]

Flexibility (adherence):
Quotes: No relevant quotes identified. 
Reasoning: The full text does not discuss any measures to monitor or enforce patient adherence to the hippotherapy sessions. No details are provided about patients being withdrawn for non-adherence. The lack of information suggests adherence flexibility was likely similar to usual care.
Score: [4]

Follow-up:
Quotes: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Examinations and questionnaires were completed prior to the first hippotherapy session (baseline), after 6–7 weeks (interim assessment) and after 12 weeks (final assessment). Physiotherapists who assessed the endpoints in a separate room were blinded and explicitly trained not to question patients or hippotherapists.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: Assessments were conducted at baseline, 6-7 weeks and 12 weeks. This schedule involves more frequent follow-up than would be typical for hippotherapy in usual care. The use of blinded assessors also makes the follow-up more explanatory than usual care.
Score: [2]

Primary outcome:
Quotes: <span title='Moderate quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 94.2%):

primary endpoint was the change in the BBS 10–13 (difference from BBS baseline to week 12). Secondary endpoints were changes from baseline in fatigue (Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS)), 14,15 health-related quality of life (Multiple Sclerosis Quality of Life-54 (MSQoL-54)), 16 pain (Visual Analogue Scale (VAS)), 17,18 and spasticity (Numeric Rating Scale (NRS)).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ff9e81'>&quot;Primary endpoint was the change in the BBS (Berg Balance Scale) (0–13 (difference from BBS baseline to week 12). Secondary endpoints were changes from baseline in fatigue (Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS)),14,15 health-related quality of life (Multiple Sclerosis Quality of Life-54 (MSQoL-54)),16 pain (Visual Analogue Scale (VAS)),17,18 and spasticity (Numeric Rating Scale (NRS)).&quot;</span>
Reasoning: The primary outcome of Berg Balance Scale is a clinically relevant measure that would be used to assess the effectiveness of hippotherapy in usual care. The secondary outcomes of fatigue, quality of life, pain and spasticity are also patient-relevant. The outcomes do not appear to require any central adjudication or special assessment not part of usual care.

Reasoning: The primary analysis was conducted on a modified intention-to-treat population that excluded patients without a valid baseline assessment. Missing data was imputed using last observation carried forward. This approach is more explanatory than a full intention-to-treat analysis using all randomized patients. However, only a small number of patients were excluded.

The trial used an expert multidisciplinary panel to assess participants and provide them with personalized information and advice. This represents an explanatory approach with extra resources and organization compared to usual care.

Approximately two weeks later, EG participants received a single follow-through phone call from the research OT to confirm and reinforce the educational content of the visit, after which EG patients had no subsequent contact with the OT&quot;</span>
The educational intervention followed a defined structure, with an expert panel assessment, personalized information provision, action plan, and single follow-up phone call. There appears to be little flexibility to adapt the delivery compared to usual care.
Score: [2]

Primary outcome:
Quotes: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Primary outcome measures were reports of one or more falls or skin sores. At interview, participants were asked 'In the past 12 months, have you fallen? Have you had a skin sore?' Participants were assessed at baseline and 12 months later.&quot;</span>
The primary outcomes of falls and skin sores were assessed by participant self-report at 12-month follow-up. These outcomes are relevant to patients and do not require assessment methods beyond what would be available in usual care.

Fifty patients with relapsing MS, followed at the Jacobs MS Center for Treatment and Research, Department of Neurology, University at Buffalo, Buffalo New York, USA, were enrolled in this study. Inclusion criteria consisted of: a diagnosis of relapsing MS according to McDonald criteria, 19 being on natalizumab therapy for 24 months or longer, aged between 18 and 65 years and an EDSS score of ≤7.0. 20 Candidates were excluded from the study if active disease was identified at baseline per clinical ( presence of a relapse during the previous 30 days) and/or MRI evaluation (active gadolinium (Gd)-enhancing lesions).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;Fifty patients with relapsing MS, followed at the Jacobs MS Center for Treatment and Research, Department of Neurology, University at Buffalo, Buffalo New York, USA, were enrolled in this study. Inclusion criteria consisted of: a diagnosis of relapsing MS according to McDonald criteria,1,2 being on natalizumab therapy for 24 months or longer, aged between 18 and 65 years and an EDSS score of ≤7.0.30 Candidates were excluded from the study if active disease was identified at baseline per clinical (presence of a relapse during the previous 30 days) and/or MRI evaluation (active gadolinium (Gd)-enhancing lesions).&quot;</span>

The eligibility criteria are somewhat restrictive, including only relapsing MS patients aged 18-65 with EDSS ≤7.0 who had been on natalizumab for ≥24 months and had no active disease at baseline. This represents a subset of the MS population that would be treated with natalizumab in usual care.

Patients were recruited from a single MS center where they were already being treated. This approach is similar to how patients would be identified and approached about the trial in a usual care setting.
Score: [4]

Organization:
Quotes: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Patients in both groups may have received additional optional treatment with intravenous myethylprednisolone (IVMP) in the first 6 months post-natalizumab discontinuation. The dose of IVMP treatment was at the discretion of the treating physician in agreement with the patient and included (A) no IVMP treatment, (B) 1 g/day q4 weeks during 6 months after last natalizumab infusion.&quot;</span>

The trial utilized additional IVMP treatment that was administered based on physician and patient discretion, similar to how it would be used in routine care. No other major differences in care organization are noted.

The dose of IVMP treatment was at the discretion of the treating physician in agreement with the patient and included (A) no IVMP treatment, (B) 1 g/day q4 weeks during 6 months after last natalizumab infusion.&quot;</span>

The flexibility in delivery of the optional IVMP treatment, based on physician and patient agreement, is similar to the flexibility that would be present in usual care. The delivery of the main intervention (natalizumab discontinuation followed by either fingolimod or DMT) seems to follow a protocol, but some flexibility is still present.
Score: [3]

Flexibility (adherence):
No specific information is provided on measures to monitor or enforce patient adherence to the assigned treatment strategies. The flexibility in adherence is likely similar to usual care.

Follow-up:
Quotes: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;A physical examination and neurological assessment was administered at baseline, 3, 6 and 12 months postdiscontinuation (counted from the last natalizumab infusion), as well as during unscheduled visits due to relapses (within 3–5 days of any new symptom development). The Treating Neurologist evaluated the patient during the visits (scheduled and nonscheduled/urgent visits). An Examining Neurologist performed the Kurtzke EDSS blinded to the arm the patient was randomised to. Vitals, safety information and concomitant medications were obtained at the q3-month scheduled visits. See online supplementary appendix for an overview of assessments per time period.&quot;</span>

The follow-up schedule involved q3-month visits with additional unscheduled visits for relapses. Safety information was collected at the q3-month visits. This represents a somewhat more intensive follow-up schedule than typical usual care for MS patients.

The primary outcome of MRI activity and relapses over 12 months is relevant to MS patients and reflective of disease activity. MRI and relapses would likely be monitored in usual care after natalizumab discontinuation, though perhaps not at the frequency in the trial.

All number and activity analysis were performed using scan-to-scan comparisons without a priori identification of lesions. A new Gd-enhancing lesion was defined as a typical area of hyperintense signal on postcontrast T1-WI. A new or newly enlarging lesion on T2-WI and T1-WI at follow-up was defined as a round or oval lesion arising from an area previously considered normal appearing brain tissue and/or showing an identifiable increase in size from a previously stable-appearing lesion.

The analysis considered all MRI scans and compared them to previous scans to identify new or enlarged lesions. This approach includes all data in an ITT-style analysis, although it is not explicitly stated if there were any post-randomization exclusions. Relapses also seem to be analyzed for all patients.

Inclusion criteria were the following: diagnosis of MS made by a neurologist, able to walk 10 meters with or without an aid within 2 minutes, no relapse of their MS in the past 4 weeks, and no other neurological or orthopedic condition that would affect their function.&quot;</span>
The eligibility criteria were fairly broad, including anyone with a diagnosis of MS who could walk 10m within 2 minutes and had no relapse in the past 4 weeks. This is similar to the population that would receive the intervention as part of usual care. The only additional criteria were no other neurological/orthopedic conditions affecting function, which may be a bit more restrictive than usual care.

Components from HealthStepsTM that were integrated into Hockey FIT included the following: 1) lifestyle prescriptions for healthy eating, PA (i.e., steps) and exercise, and 2) eHealth technologies including the private and customizable online social network platform and the HealtheStepsTM smartphone app designed to help participants maintain their PA and exercise goals in the long term.&quot;</span>
The intervention followed a 12-week program protocol, but some flexibility was incorporated by adapting certain elements to the North American and hockey context. eHealth technologies allowed participants some customization.

Very little information is provided in the text regarding flexibility of adherence. One participant withdrew after being assigned to the comparison group, suggesting adherence was not strictly mandatory.

Follow-up assessments were conducted at 12 weeks (intervention only) and 12 months (both groups). An extensive set of measures were collected including weight, BMI, waist circumference, blood pressure, step counts, diet, self-rated health, self-esteem, and sitting time. This represents a more intensive follow-up schedule and measurement battery than would be typical in usual care.

The pregnant women were randomly divided into three groups at a university hospital in the suburbs of Sao Paulo, Brazil, in order to receive either acupressure treatment, a placebo or participate as part of a control group.&quot;</span>
The eligibility criteria are quite broad, including pregnant women at 37+ weeks with cervical dilation ≥4cm and 2+ contractions in 10 minutes. This represents a fairly typical population that would receive acupressure during labor in usual care. However, the study was conducted at a single university hospital in Sao Paulo, which may differ somewhat from other usual care settings.

The trial was conducted at a single university hospital in Sao Paulo. While this is a usual care setting, using only a single center makes the setting more explanatory than pragmatic.

A child-cushioned electronic anthropometric scale was used to control and to put consistent pressure on the thumps until the researcher could apply such pressure for the SP6 and TG groups.&quot;</span>
The study used specialized training (32 hours) for the researcher applying acupressure. A special electronic scale was also used to standardize pressure. This represents greater expertise and resources than would typically be available in usual care.

Then the intensity of the pain was evaluated using the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS).&quot;</span>
A strict protocol was used, with acupressure applied for a fixed 20 minute period during contractions, followed by VAS pain assessment. This allowed little flexibility in intervention delivery compared to usual care.
Score: [2]

Flexibility (adherence):
This domain is not applicable, as it relates to participant adherence. For a labor trial, women do not "adhere" to the intervention after giving initial consent.
Score: [NA] 

Follow-up:
Quotes: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The intensity of the pain was evaluated using the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). Results: The averages for the pain measured using the VAS were not different for the three groups that were a part of the study (p-value=0.0929), however they were less in the acupressure groups immediately after receiving the treatment (p-value=<0.0001).&quot;</span>
VAS pain intensity was evaluated during the 20 minute acupressure application and immediately after, but no long-term follow-up was done. This short-term assessment is less intensive than typical research, but may be more than usual care.

The trial included patients aged 45-65 with mild to moderate COPD, along with a family member for whom no specific eligibility criteria were set. This is somewhat more restrictive than the typical COPD patient population which includes a wider age range and disease severity spectrum. However, no additional selection tests were used that are not part of usual care.

The primary outcomes were smoking status validated by exhaled carbon monoxide, self-reported COPD exacerbations, and self-reported satisfaction on a research-specific questionnaire. The smoking outcome is relevant to patients, but the self-report questionnaire in particular is less directly meaningful to participants than measures of how they feel or function in daily life.

Patients were recruited from asthma registers at the participating general practices. This appears to be a pragmatic approach using the usual patient population at these practices, without extra effort to recruit. However, restricting to only those due for an annual review and excluding COPD patients is a bit more explanatory.

Organization:
Quotes: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Nurses were given no instructions about the content of the review except that it should reflect their normal practice and be appropriate to each patient's clinical need. Details about the consultation, including failed attempts at phone calls and the duration of the consultation, were recorded immediately after the review on a piloted consultation record.&quot;</span>
The organization appears to be very pragmatic, with nurses given no special instructions and told to conduct the reviews as per their normal practice. Data collection was simply a consultation record filled immediately after. No extra organizational resources or training appear to have been used.

The delivery of the telephone consultations was highly flexible, with nurses told to use their normal practice and tailor it to individual patient needs. This matches the flexibility that would be expected in usual care.
Score: [5]

Flexibility (adherence):
There are no relevant quotes about monitoring or promoting patient adherence to the telephone consultation intervention. The nature of the intervention as a one-time consultation does not really have any adherence component.

The primary outcomes of proportion reviewed and asthma-related quality of life are important and relevant to patients. The mini asthma quality of life questionnaire is a validated patient-reported outcome. The anticipated 25% non-completion rate of questionnaires suggests the outcome measures may be somewhat burdensome for patients however.

Reasoning: The trial had some exclusion criteria that differ from usual care, such as excluding those with unstable diseases or who were unable to complete questionnaires on their own. However, the criteria were not overly restrictive and the participants were still fairly similar to those who would receive the intervention as part of usual care.
Score: [4]

Reasoning: Patients were recruited based on having a diagnosis of RA using standard ACR criteria. Randomization occurred after obtaining consent. This recruitment approach is only slightly different from how patients would be identified and engaged in usual care.
Score: [4]

Setting:
Quotes: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;This study required three practitioners at each centre; a CNS, a rheumatologist and a blind independent assessor. Nine CNS and 10 rheumatologists delivered the interventions. The CNS had a median experience of 10 years in their current post while the rheumatologists had a median of 9 years at consultant level. The CNS have experience in running nurse-led clinics and usually have a postgraduate qualification in rheumatology nursing and/or prescribing.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: The trial took place at typical rheumatology clinics with experienced practitioners who usually run nurse-led clinics. This setting appears very similar to where the intervention would be delivered in usual care.

The CNS had a median experience of 10 years in their current post while the rheumatologists had a median of 9 years at consultant level.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: The interventions were delivered by experienced rheumatology practitioners as part of their normal roles. No details are provided about strict protocols or monitoring of intervention delivery. The flexibility appears similar to usual care.
Score: [4]

Flexibility (adherence):
Quotes: No relevant quotes identified.
Reasoning: The full text does not provide any information on if or how patient adherence to the intervention was monitored or encouraged. There is insufficient information to assess flexibility of adherence.
Score: [NA]

Follow-up:
Quotes: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;When patients arrived at the clinic, the independent assessor performed 'joint counts' for DAS28 and then oversaw the completion of self-reported pain visual analogue scale (pain-VAS), fatigue VAS and duration of morning stiffness. The patients were then given questionnaires in 'freepost' return envelopes before consultation with their allocated practitioner.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: Patients completed questionnaires and had joint counts performed at clinic visits. This follow-up process is only slightly more involved than usual rheumatology clinic visits that would include some assessment of disease status.
Score: [4]

Primary outcome:
Quotes: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The primary outcome was the disease activity score (DAS28) assessed at baseline, weeks 13, 26, 39 and 52; the non-inferiority margin being DAS28 change of 0.6.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: DAS28 is a highly relevant, standard measure of rheumatoid arthritis disease activity that combines patient-reported and clinical examination components. It would likely be used to assess RA activity in usual care as well.
Score: [5]

Primary analysis:
Quotes: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Analysis followed per-protocol (PP) and intention-to-treat (ITT) approaches.&quot;</span> <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The former was based on evaluation of all participants who completed the five treatment sessions and focused on a complete case analysis; the latter was based on evaluation of all trial participants as allocated.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: The primary analysis used both per-protocol and intention-to-treat approaches. ITT includes all participants as randomized, which is more pragmatic. However, the per-protocol analysis excluded those who did not complete the intervention, which is a more explanatory approach. On balance, the analysis falls in the middle of the explanatory-pragmatic continuum.

Eligibility:
Quotes: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants comprised 50.6% Indigenous Australians and 60.8% had established CVD. At baseline, use of combination treatment was 50.1%.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: The trial included a broad population of participants, with over half being Indigenous Australians and a majority having established cardiovascular disease. This suggests the eligibility criteria were quite pragmatic and representative of the real-world patient population. However, the full details of the eligibility criteria are not provided, so it's difficult to fully assess how pragmatic they were.

Failure to recruit the planned number of participants reflected insufficient resources to continue enrolment.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: Participants were recruited from 33 real-world health centers, including 12 Aboriginal Medical Services. This represents quite pragmatic recruitment through usual care facilities. However, the trial failed to recruit the planned number of participants, suggesting recruitment was more challenging than in usual care.
Score: [4]

Setting:
Quotes: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants attended the primary healthcare centres for trial assessments at randomization and 12 month intervals thereafter.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: The trial was conducted in real-world primary healthcare centers where participants regularly attended. This setting appears to be identical to the usual care setting where patients would normally receive CVD management.
Score: [5]

Organization:
Quotes: <span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 99.3%):

Reasoning: After randomization, participants had 3-monthly follow-ups which could be done by phone. This level of organization does not seem substantially different from usual care. However, the one-month post-randomization review for all participants may exceed what is typically done in usual care.
Score: [4]

Flexibility (delivery):
Quotes: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;At one extreme, patients ineligible for any concessions were charged the standard co-payment (approximately AUD$35/month for each medication). At the other extreme, the polypill was dispensed without charge at Indigenous health services operating under the Section 100 scheme of the National Health Act.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: The flexibility in polypill delivery allowed for it to be provided for free to some Indigenous participants, but charged a co-payment to others, based on the rules of the health service. This suggests delivery flexibility was similar to usual care, as it operated within existing health system rules and did not use any special procedures.

Reasoning: Participants were excluded if thought unlikely to adhere, but this was a one-time exclusion criteria applied at enrollment. There is no indication of any special procedures to monitor or enforce adherence during the trial. Participants could choose between two different polypill formulations, allowing some flexibility. Overall adherence flexibility seems similar to usual care.

Reasoning: Participants were followed up every 3 months, which exceeds usual care. However, these visits could be conducted by phone, and the 12-monthly in-person visits with BP and labs seem generally aligned with typical follow-up for CVD care. On balance, follow-up was only moderately more intense than usual care.
Score: [3]

Primary outcome:
Quotes: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Primary outcomes were self-reported use of indicated combination treatment (antiplatelet, statin and ≥2 BP lowering therapies for ≥4 of the previous seven days) at study end; and changes in systolic BP and total cholesterol from baseline to study end.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: The co-primary outcomes of self-reported adherence to indicated CVD medicines and changes in BP/cholesterol are patient-relevant outcomes. The use of self-report for adherence is pragmatic, though potentially less accurate than direct measures. BP and cholesterol are surrogate outcomes but commonly used in usual care.
Score: [4]

Primary analysis:
Quotes: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Analyses of change in systolic BP and total cholesterol were conducted using longitudinal linear mixed models including all values collected during follow-up. Models included treatment, visit, treatment-by-visit interaction, and the baseline systolic BP or total cholesterol.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: The primary analyses used mixed models incorporating all data collected during follow-up. While not explicitly stated, this longitudinal modeling approach implicitly handles missing data pragmatically without requiring complete case data. However, some details are lacking to determine if the analysis fully followed intention-to-treat principles.

Eligibility:
Quotes: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;To evaluate the clinical effectiveness of surgical vs nonsurgical treatment for adults with displaced fractures of the proximal humerus involving the surgical neck.&quot;</span>
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;A pragmatic, multicenter, parallel-group, randomized clinical trial, the Proximal Fracture of the Humerus Evaluation by Randomization (PROFHER) trial, recruited 250 patients aged 16 years or older (mean age, 66 years [range, 24-92 years]; 192 [77%] were female; and 249 [99.6%] were white) who presented at the orthopedic departments of 32 acute UK National Health Service hospitals between September 2008 and April 2011 within 3 weeks after sustaining a displaced fracture of the proximal humerus involving the surgical neck.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: The eligibility criteria are quite broad, including adults aged 16 years or older who sustained a displaced proximal humerus fracture involving the surgical neck within 3 weeks. The mean age of 66 years with a wide range of 24-92 years, and the inclusion of 32 hospitals, suggests the study population is fairly representative of the typical patient population for this condition. However, nearly all participants being white may somewhat limit generalizability.
Score: [4]

Recruitment:
Quotes: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Patients were followed up for 2 years (up to April 2013) and 215 had complete follow-up data.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: The full text does not provide details on the recruitment process, such as whether participants were recruited during usual care visits or through other means. The high follow-up rate of 215 out of 250 patients (86%) at 2 years suggests recruitment was likely done in a pragmatic way integrated with usual care, but there is insufficient information to determine how explanatory or pragmatic the recruitment was.
Score: [NA]

Setting:
Quotes: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;A pragmatic, multicenter, parallel-group, randomized clinical trial, the Proximal Fracture of the Humerus Evaluation by Randomization (PROFHER) trial, recruited 250 patients aged 16 years or older (mean age, 66 years [range, 24-92 years]; 192 [77%] were female; and 249 [99.6%] were white) who presented at the orthopedic departments of 32 acute UK National Health Service hospitals between September 2008 and April 2011 within 3 weeks after sustaining a displaced fracture of the proximal humerus involving the surgical neck.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: The trial was conducted at 32 orthopedic departments of acute UK National Health Service hospitals. This represents the typical setting in which patients with proximal humerus fractures are treated in the UK healthcare system and is likely very similar to usual care.
Score: [5]

Organization:
Quotes: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Standardized outpatient and community-based rehabilitation was provided to both groups.&quot;</span>
<span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Fracture fixation or humeral head replacement were performed by surgeons experienced in these techniques. Nonsurgical treatment was sling immobilization. Standardized outpatient and community-based rehabilitation was provided to both groups.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: Both surgical and nonsurgical groups received standardized rehabilitation in outpatient and community settings, which appears to be similar to usual care. The surgical procedures were performed by experienced surgeons, which is likely typical in usual care. No additional details are provided about the healthcare providers or resources used in the trial compared to usual care.
Score: [4]

Flexibility (delivery):
Quotes: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Fracture fixation or humeral head replacement were performed by surgeons experienced in these techniques. Nonsurgical treatment was sling immobilization.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: The delivery of the surgical and nonsurgical interventions appears to have been flexible and at the discretion of the treating surgeons, similar to usual care. Surgeons could choose between fracture fixation or humeral head replacement based on their experience. Nonsurgical treatment was simply sling immobilization. No strict protocols or monitoring procedures are mentioned.
Score: [5]  

Flexibility (adherence):
Quotes: No relevant quotes identified.
Reasoning: The study interventions were a one-time surgery or sling immobilization. Participant adherence is not relevant, as they do not need to adhere to the interventions after the initial treatment.
Score: [NA]

Follow-up:
Quotes: <span title='Moderate quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 84.4%):

Sample size was based on a minimal clinically important difference of 5 points for the Oxford Shoulder Score.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: Patients were followed up at 6, 12 and 24 months, with the primary outcome assessed at 6 and 12 months. This represents a fairly long-term follow-up that is likely more intensive than usual care for this condition. However, the follow-up does not appear to be overly burdensome, with just 3 assessments over 2 years.
Score: [3]

Primary outcome:
Quotes: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The primary outcome was the Oxford Shoulder Score (OSS), which is a shoulder-specific outcome measure validated in a UK population.12 The OSS provides a total score based on the patient's subjective assessment of pain and function. It contains 12 items, each with 5 categories of response, and a range of total scores of 0 (worst outcome) to 48 (best outcome).13 The OSS was collected by postal questionnaires at 6, 12, and 24 months.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: The primary outcome, the Oxford Shoulder Score, is a validated patient-reported outcome measure assessing shoulder pain and function. It is collected via postal questionnaires and directly measures outcomes relevant to patients. This appears to be a pragmatic outcome choice. However, the OSS may not be used routinely in usual care, so it is not entirely pragmatic.
Score: [4]

Primary analysis:
Quotes: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Analyses followed a prespecified analysis plan endorsed by the data monitoring and ethics committee, and were performed using Stata version 12 (StataCorp).

The most common reason for exclusion (>1 reason per patient possible) was that a patient had comorbidities that precluded surgery or anesthetic.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: The primary analysis was conducted on an intention-to-treat basis, including all randomized patients according to their assigned groups. This is a pragmatic approach that preserves randomization and includes all data. However, a significant number of screened patients (55%) were excluded for reasons such as having comorbidities precluding surgery, which may decrease generalizability to some extent.

Eligibility
Quotes:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Practices were recruited with assistance from Primary Care Research Networks for London, Derby, and Nottingham. Patients aged ≥65 years were identified by searches of computerised medical records and invited to participate if they were: • community dwelling aged ≥65 years; • independently mobile (with or without a walking aid); and • physically able to take part in group exercise.&quot;</span>
2. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Patients were excluded if they: • had experienced ≥3 falls in the previous year; • had unstable clinical conditions; • would be unable to follow instructions about exercise safely; or • were receiving palliative care.&quot;</span>

The trial recruited participants from primary care practices with some exclusion criteria, such as those with ≥3 falls in the previous year, unstable clinical conditions, inability to follow exercise instructions safely, or receiving palliative care. However, the inclusion criteria were relatively broad, including those aged ≥65 years who were community-dwelling, independently mobile, and physically able to do group exercise. This represents a moderately pragmatic approach, as the participants are generally representative of older primary care patients, with some reasonable exclusions.

2. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Volunteer peer mentors supported participants in the OEP arm, and weekly FaME classes were run in local venues by postural stability instructors trained to work with older people. Both interventions were delivered for 24 weeks. Participants in the usual-care arm were not offered either programme.&quot;</span>

The interventions required some additional organization compared to usual care, including group classes run by trained postural stability instructors for the FaME arm, and the involvement of volunteer peer mentors to support the OEP arm. However, the exercises were carried out unsupervised at home. This represents a moderate increase in organization compared to usual care.

The interventions had a protocol in terms of the frequency and general content of the group classes and home exercises. However, the exercises were undertaken unsupervised at home, allowing some flexibility in how they were carried out. The use of peer mentors and postural stability instructors trained to work with older people also suggests the delivery could be adapted to individual participants to some extent.
Score: [3]

Flexibility (adherence)
Quotes: 
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants in the FaME arm, compared with usual care, reported more MVPA at 12 months, adding around 15 minutes of MVPA per day.&quot;</span>
2. <span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 99.7%):

The odds ratio (OR) for reaching or exceeding the target of 150 minutes of MVPA per weeks in the FaME arm was 1.78 (95% confidence interval [CI] =1.11 to 2.87, P = 0.02). There was no statistically significant difference in reaching the target between the OEP and usual-care arms (OR 1.17 (95% CI = 0.72 to 1.92), P = 0.52).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;The odds ratios for reaching the target of 150 minutes of MVPA per week in the FaME arm was 1.78 (95% confidence interval [CI] =1.11 to 2.87, P = 0.02). There was no statistically significant difference in reaching the target between the OEP and usual-care arms (OR 1.17 [95% CI = 0.72 to 1.92], P = 0.52).&quot;</span>

The study reported on adherence measures, suggesting that adherence was encouraged but not required. Participants in the FaME arm had higher odds of reaching the target MVPA levels compared to usual care, but there was no significant difference between OEP and usual care. This indicates that participants had flexibility in their level of adherence to the interventions.

Follow-up assessments were carried out at baseline, 6 months and 12 months, which exceeds the intensity of follow-up that would occur in usual care. However, the assessments took place at the participants' general practices or usual care venues, consistent with a pragmatic approach. The use of intention-to-treat analysis and multiple imputation to include all participants is also pragmatic.

2. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The primary outcome was the proportion of participants who reported reaching ≥150 minutes of MVPA per week. Physical activity was assessed using validated questionnaires: Phone-FITT, the Physical Activity Scale for the Elderly (PASE), and the Community Healthy Activities Model Program for Seniors (CHAMPS). The primary outcome measure was the CHAMPS questionnaire.&quot;</span>

The primary outcome of proportion of participants achieving at least 150 minutes of moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) per week is highly relevant to the participants and consistent with guidelines for older adults. It was assessed using self-reported validated questionnaires, which are feasible measures for use in regular clinical practice, although some bias in self-reporting is possible.

Reasoning: The trial used screening questionnaires (GHQ-12 and HADS) to identify eligible participants with multiple sclerosis and low mood. This represents a somewhat explanatory approach, as these specific screening tests may not be used in usual care to determine eligibility for psychological therapy. However, people with multiple sclerosis and low mood would be the appropriate population for this intervention in usual care.

Reasoning: Participants were recruited through screening using questionnaires. While this is a systematic approach, it's not clear if it required extra effort beyond what would be done in usual care to engage patients with multiple sclerosis for psychological therapy. More details would be needed to determine how pragmatic or explanatory the recruitment process was compared to usual care.

Reasoning: The trial was conducted in a community setting, as participants were screened and recruited from the general population of people with multiple sclerosis. This represents a pragmatic approach, as it used a setting that appears very similar to where patients would be identified and treated in usual care.

Reasoning: The intervention was delivered by Band 5 assistant psychologists, supervised by an experienced Band 8a clinical psychologist. This likely represents an explanatory approach, as the level of expertise and supervision is probably greater than what would be routinely available in usual care to deliver this type of group psychological intervention.

Reasoning: There are no details provided in the full text about flexibility of intervention delivery. It's not stated whether a strict protocol was followed or if the psychologists could adapt delivery based on circumstances. Insufficient information to assess how pragmatic or explanatory intervention delivery flexibility was compared to usual care.

Reasoning: There was some flexibility in participant adherence, as they were telephoned once if they did not return questionnaires. However, it's not clear if this single reminder call represents a pragmatic approach similar to what would be done in usual care, or if it is an explanatory approach with extra efforts to ensure adherence. More information is needed to fully assess flexibility of adherence compared to usual care.
Score: [NA]

Follow-up:
Quotes: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Four and eight months after random allocation, participants were sent a booklet of outcome questionnaires to complete and return by post. This booklet included the measures administered at baseline, the General Health Questionnaire 12 and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, and in addition the BDI-II,6 a measure of the severity of depression.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: Follow-up involved mailed questionnaires at 4 and 8 months, including the same baseline measures plus an additional depression severity measure (BDI-II). This likely represents a somewhat explanatory approach, as the follow-up is more extensive than what would typically be done in usual care, especially the addition of the BDI-II. However, the follow-up is not overly burdensome and the timing is not too far off from what might be reasonable for usual care.

To ascertain costs, a questionnaire was used to assess the use of NHS services and prescribed medication in the previous three months.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: The primary outcome measures were quality of life (EQ-5D) and costs/service use. These outcomes are relevant to participants and likely consistent with what would be collected in usual care. Using a generic QoL measure and assessing costs pragmatically from an NHS perspective suggests an approach similar to usual care evaluation of a psychological intervention.

Reasoning: The primary analysis appears to have used all available data (71% of eligible patients were enrolled). The full text does not explicitly state that intention-to-treat analysis was done, but it seems data was collected and analyzed from all randomized participants who completed questionnaires, regardless of adherence to the intervention. This suggests a fairly pragmatic approach, although more details on handling of missing data would be needed to fully assess this domain.

The eligibility criteria excluded patients with major psychiatric disorders other than those caused by MS, as well as patients with substance dependence, neurological disorders, recent corticosteroid use or disease recurrence. This represents a more explanatory than pragmatic approach, as these criteria are more restrictive than what would likely be used in routine care of MS patients.

The intervention involved multiple sessions teaching various techniques for managing depression, stress, anxiety and fatigue in MS patients. This represents a more explanatory approach, as it requires additional training and organization of care beyond what would be typical in routine management of MS.

Flexibility (delivery):
Quotes: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The intervention was implemented within two days a week. For the control group, a routine protocol was conducted. For blinding, the patients of the control group referred to the Society on certain days of week and those of the experimental on other days.&quot;</span>
The intervention followed a defined schedule of two sessions per week on specific days, separate from the control group. This suggests a less flexible, more explanatory approach to intervention delivery compared to routine care.
Score: [2]

Flexibility (adherence):
The article does not discuss flexibility of participant adherence to the intervention or any measures taken to monitor or encourage adherence. There is insufficient information provided to assess how pragmatic or explanatory adherence flexibility was compared to routine care.

Reasoning: The trial utilized a novel computerized intervention (MAPSS-MS) that included specialized software. Project staff were involved but participants could practice cognitive strategies without their direct supervision. This suggests the resources, expertise and organization differed moderately from usual care, which likely would not have access to this type of software and training. However, the ability for participants to practice independently makes it more pragmatic than an intervention fully delivered by experts.

Reasoning: Participants had follow-up assessments at baseline, immediately after the intervention, and 3 and 6 months post-intervention. This schedule involves more intensive follow-up than would be typical in usual care, but is not as extensive as some explanatory trials (e.g. with triggered unscheduled visits). The 6 month total follow-up duration is longer than many explanatory trials but shorter than long-term pragmatic studies.

Reasoning: The primary outcomes were neuropsychological assessments covering cognitive domains like memory, attention, processing speed, and executive functioning. These outcomes are relevant to cognitive functioning in MS patients. However, they are assessed in a research context using neuropsychological tests that may not be routinely used in clinical practice. The outcomes are important to participants but are somewhat removed from direct functional impacts.

Neuropsychological data were scored by the testers and verified by a second staff member. Data were entered and checked for accuracy. Internal consistency reliability coefficients for all self-report measures were .80 or above. Descriptive analyses were performed to obtain a profile of the sample. The groups were compared at baseline on demographic and disease variables. Preliminary analysis for assumptions of normality, independence of errors, homogeneity of variance, and outliers suggested that assumptions had generally been met and therefore data transformations were deemed unnecessary.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: The primary analysis appears to have used all available data, as the sample sizes remain consistent from baseline to follow-up (no mention of excluding participants). This represents an intent-to-treat approach that is more pragmatic. However, the trial did employ some explanatory-style data verification and checking procedures that differ from usual care.

Inclusion criteria were (1) 18–60 years of age, (2) ⩾2 years since clinical diagnosis with relapsing remitting MS (RRMS) and (3) no relapses or changes in medication status 8 weeks prior to inclusion.&quot;</span>
The eligibility criteria are somewhat stricter than what would be used in usual care, with an upper age limit of 60 and requiring no recent relapses or medication changes. However, the criteria are not overly narrow and patients were recruited from multiple MS clinics, making the population more representative of typical MS patients compared to a highly selective trial population.

Patients were recruited from multiple MS clinics and the national MS society, which is likely similar to how patients would be identified and recruited in usual care. No additional efforts beyond routine care seem to have been made.
Score: [4]

Setting:
The study does not provide details on the specific setting of the intervention. It is not clear if the exercise training took place in usual care settings like clinics and rehab centers or in specialized research facilities. There is not enough information provided to score this domain.

The exercise intervention required supervision twice per week for 48 weeks, which is more intensive than what would typically be available in usual care. The regimen was also individually tailored and progressive in intensity, likely requiring additional expertise and resources compared to usual care.

The eligibility criteria are somewhat stricter than what would likely be used in usual care for MS patients. The age range is limited to 14-50 years, and there are several exclusion criteria related to comorbidities and abnormal lab values that may not be routinely used to determine MS treatment eligibility in practice. However, the core diagnosis is still based on standard clinical manifestations and MRI.

The trial recruited patients from a single hospital who were referred there for MS. This seems to align with how patients would be identified and recruited in usual care - through referral to a hospital for management of their MS. No additional efforts for recruitment beyond standard care are mentioned.
Score: [5]

Setting:
Quotes: No relevant quotes identified.
The full text does not explicitly describe the setting of the trial. It is conducted at a single hospital in Iran, but without more details on how this compares to other usual care settings for MS patients, there is insufficient information to assess this domain.

The primary outcomes were change in EDSS disability score and relapse rate, which are relevant and important to MS patients. The measures are compared between start and end of treatment at 24 months, which is a timeframe of clinical significance. The outcomes do not appear to be assessed differently than they would in usual care.

There was no evidence that treatment prevented deterioration or reduced the number or severity of the relapses when compared with 169 control patients observed and scored in a similar way for the same period of time.' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;181 patients with multiple sclerosis were treated with corticotrophin daily for eighteen months. There was no evidence that treatment prevented deterioration or reduced the number or severity of the relapses when compared with 169 control patients observed and scored in a similar way for the same period of time.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: The trial included a broad population of multiple sclerosis patients and did not appear to have strict exclusion criteria. However, the full eligibility criteria are not provided in detail, so it is difficult to assess how pragmatic the eligibility was compared to usual care.
Score: [3]

Recruitment:
Quotes: None relevant to recruitment.
Reasoning: The full text does not provide any information on how participants were recruited into the trial. Without these details, the recruitment methods cannot be compared to usual care.

Reasoning: The trial was conducted in three cities, but the specific settings within those cities are not described. It is unclear if the settings mirror those of usual care or if they were specialized trial centers. More information is needed to assess this domain fully.
Score: [3]

Organization:

Despite intravenous hydrocortisone and other therapy, intramuscular cortisone acetate, and chloromycetin she died the following day.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: The quote suggests there was some flexibility in the delivery of the intervention, with corticotrophin being reduced and other treatments advised/given. However, the full extent of flexibility in delivery is not clear from the limited information provided.
Score: [3]

Flexibility (adherence):
Quotes: None relevant to adherence.
Reasoning: The article does not discuss participant adherence to the intervention or if there were any measures to improve or enforce adherence. There is not enough information provided to assess the flexibility of adherence compared to usual care.

Reasoning: The trial used specific diagnostic criteria (Poser criteria) and only included patients suffering from a relapse of MS. This represents a more explanatory approach, as the eligibility criteria are narrower than what would be used in usual care for all MS patients.
Score: [2]

Bed rest has traditionally been prescribed in our clinic, because of a positive clinical experience, though no firm scientific ground can be presented to support this form of treatment (5).&quot;</span>
Reasoning: The treatment protocol involved a specific ACTH preparation, dosing, and tapering schedule, as well as prescribed bed rest, which suggests an explanatory approach. However, bed rest was prescribed based on traditional clinical experience rather than a strict protocol. Overall, the delivery flexibility appears to be a balance between explanatory and pragmatic approaches.

After treatment with ACTH a higher, though not statistically significant, relapse rate in the following months was noticed.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: Follow-up lasted one year, which is likely longer than typical follow-up in usual care for MS relapses. The trial also used several MS-specific rating scales. This represents a more explanatory approach with more extensive follow-up and data collection than usual care.

Reasoning: The primary outcomes appear to be MS disease stages and rating scale scores, which would be relevant to MS patients. However, the Mann-Whitney U test and Chi-square test are statistical approaches that would not be used in usual care. The primary outcome assessment is a balance between pragmatic patient-centered outcomes and explanatory statistical analysis.

Primary analysis:
Quotes: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Only 29 patients entered the trial. The number of patients was much smaller than was hoped for when the study was envisaged. This was due to a changing attitude towards bed rest and the introduction of short term high dose methylprednisolone treatment (9), which rapidly has gained a wide acceptance among neurologists.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: The analysis only included 29 out of the planned number of patients, due to changes in usual care during the trial. This suggests a more explanatory approach, as a pragmatic trial would have aimed to maintain the planned sample size and analysis. However, the reason for the reduced sample size was due to external changes in usual care, not factors controlled by the trial. Overall, the primary analysis appears to be a balance between pragmatic and explanatory approaches.

Quotes: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants were recruited between April 2016 and October 2017. From a total of 148 patients invited to participate, 86 were enrolled (Figure 1) and randomly assigned to the PAE or waitlist group (Table 1).&quot;</span>
Reasoning: Recruitment was done by inviting patients from MS clinics to participate, which is somewhat more effort than would be done in usual care. However, the full text lacks details on exactly how much extra effort was made to recruit beyond usual care.
Score: [3]

Setting:
Quotes: None relevant.
Reasoning: The full text does not specify the settings where the intervention was delivered, so there is not enough information to assess how similar or different they were from usual care settings.
Score: [NA]

Reasoning: The intervention group received supervised high-intensity exercise, which likely required additional staff, training and resources compared to usual care. However, the control group continued their usual lifestyle and physiotherapy, which is similar to usual care. Overall, the organization seems somewhat more explanatory than usual care but not extremely so.

Reasoning: The intervention followed a supervised 24-week high-intensity exercise protocol, which allows less flexibility in delivery compared to usual care. However, some flexibility remained as the control group continued their usual lifestyle. Overall, delivery flexibility was more explanatory than usual care but not extremely inflexible.
Score: [2]

Flexibility (adherence):
Quotes: None relevant.
Reasoning: The full text does not provide details on if or how participant adherence was monitored or enforced in the intervention group. There is not enough information to assess how pragmatic or explanatory the adherence flexibility was compared to usual care.

Reasoning: After the 24-week intervention, the initial PAE group transitioned to unsupervised community-based exercise, which is similar to usual care follow-up. The waitlist group crossed over to receive the same 24-week supervised intervention. Overall, the follow-up seems fairly pragmatic after the intervention period.

Reasoning: The eligibility criteria are fairly broad, including a wide age range of 18-65 years and EDSS scores up to 5.5, which is moderately disabled. However, the criteria do specify relapsing forms of MS and use the revised McDonald criteria, which are not identical to usual care. 
Score: [4]

Recruitment:
Quotes: None relevant to recruitment.
Reasoning: The full text does not provide any details on the recruitment methods used in the trial. There is not enough information to determine how pragmatic or explanatory the recruitment was.
Score: [NA]

The four iDMTs were subcutaneous (SC) IFN beta-1b (Extavia®, Novartis Pharma AG, Basel, Switzerland, or Betaseron®, Bayer AG, Leverkusen, Germany) 0.25 mg every other day, IM IFN beta-1a (Avonex®, Biogen Idec, Cambridge, MA, USA) 30 μg once weekly, SC IFN beta-1a (Rebif®, Merck Serono, Darmstadt, Germany, and Pfizer Inc., New York City, NY, USA) 22 or 44 μg three times weekly, or SC GA (Copaxone®, Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd, Petah Tikva, Israel) 20 mg once daily.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: The delivery of the intervention allowed some flexibility, as patients on iDMTs could remain on their current therapy or be re-randomized to another approved iDMT out of four options. However, the drugs, doses and frequencies were specified according to the approved labels. This represents an intermediate level of flexibility in delivery between strict protocols and usual care.
Score: [3]

Flexibility (adherence):
Quotes: None relevant to adherence flexibility.
Reasoning: The manuscript does not discuss any information regarding flexibility of participant adherence to the intervention or if it differed from usual care. There are no details on if measures were taken to improve adherence.

This was measured using the Global Satisfaction subscale score on the TSQM v1.4, where higher scores indicate greater satisfaction.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: Follow-up was limited to 6 months and focused on a patient-reported outcome questionnaire. This is likely not too different from usual care follow-up for MS patients starting new therapies. However, the use of a specific questionnaire is more structured than typical care.

Reasoning: The primary outcome of medication satisfaction is relevant to patients and measured using a patient-reported questionnaire. This is a pragmatic outcome that matters to patients. However, the specific TSQM questionnaire may not be used universally in usual care.
Score: [4]

Primary analysis:
Quotes: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;For the primary endpoint, enrollment of 1000 patients (750 fingolimod; 250 iDMT) would provide 90% power to detect a significant difference between fingolimod and each iDMT group in the change from baseline, assuming an effect size of 0.25, a significance level of 5% and a 10% rate of unevaluable patients.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: The primary analysis used all randomized patients with an assumed 10% rate of unevaluable patients. This is a fairly pragmatic approach, including most patients rather than a strict per-protocol analysis. However, some imputation of missing data was likely required.

Muscle endurance was interpreted as the number of repetitions that a patient could perform in a single set of knee extension exercise.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: Outcome assessments were performed before and after the 12-week training period using specialized equipment like a strain gauge and linear encoder. This is more extensive data collection than would occur in usual care over this timeframe.
Score: [2]

Primary outcome:
Quotes: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Average power test was also carried out in the knee extension machine described for the training program. Participants were evaluated during a single set to volitional exhaustion with a load corresponding to the 40% of the pre-training MVIC (De Souza-Teixeira, 2009). Subjects were requested to perform the concentric phase of every repetition with a ROM of ∼90–180 degrees, as fast as possible, and to lower the load (eccentric action; ∼180–90°) in a control manner.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: The primary outcome of average power during knee extension is likely relevant to MS patients' daily functioning. However, the assessment requires specialized equipment (knee extension machine) and procedures (single set to exhaustion at 40% pre-training MVIC) that would not be used in usual care.

You are an expert in clinical trial design and are tasked to assess the PRECIS-2 scores of a trial based on the full text of its publication. You have the following briefing:
---
# PRECIS-2 Domains
* Eligibility: To what extent are the participants in the trial similar to those who would receive this intervention if it was part of usual care? For example, score 5 for very pragmatic criteria essentially identical to those in usual care; score 1 for a very explanatory approach with lots of exclusions (e.g. those who don’t comply, respond to treatment, or are not at high risk for primary outcome, are children or elderly), or uses many selection tests not used in usual care.
* Recruitment: How much extra effort is made to recruit participants over and above what that would be used in the usual care setting to engage with patients? For example, score 5 for very pragmatic recruitment through usual appointments or clinic; score 1 for a very explanatory approach with targeted invitation letters, advertising in newspapers, radio plus incentives and other routes that would not be used in usual care.
* Setting: How different is the setting of the trial and the usual care setting? For example, score 5 for a very pragmatic choice using identical settings to usual care; score 1, for a very explanatory approach with only a single centre, or only specialised trial or academic centres.
* Organisation: How different are the resources, provider expertise and the organisation of care delivery in the intervention arm of the trial and those available in usual care? For example, score 5 for a very pragmatic choice that uses identical organisation to usual care; score 1 for a very explanatory approach if the trial increases staff levels, gives additional training, require more than usual experience or certification and increase resources.
* Flexibility (delivery): How different is the flexibility in how the intervention is delivered and the flexibility likely in usual care? For example, score 5 for a very pragmatic choice with identical flexibility to usual care; score 1 for a very explanatory approach if there is a strict protocol, monitoring and measures to improve compliance, with specific advice on allowed co-interventions and complications.
* Flexibility (adherence): How different is the flexibility in how participants must adhere to the intervention and the flexibility likely in usual care? For example, score 5 for a very pragmatic choice involving no more than usual encouragement to adhere to the intervention; score 1 for a very explanatory approach that involves exclusion based on adherence, and measures to improve adherence if found wanting. In some trials eg surgical trials where patients are being operated on or Intensive Care Unit trials where patients are being given IV drug therapy, this domain is not applicable as there is no compliance issue after consent has been given, so this score should be left blank.
* Follow-up: How different is the intensity of measurement and follow-up of participants in the trial and the likely follow-up in usual care? For example, score 5 for a very pragmatic approach with no more than usual follow up; score 1 for a very explanatory approach with more frequent, longer visits, unscheduled visits triggered by primary outcome event or intervening event, and more extensive data collection.
* Primary outcome: To what extent is the trial's primary outcome relevant to participants? For example, score 5 for a very pragmatic choice where the outcome is of obvious importance to participants; score 1 for a very explanatory approach using a surrogate, physiological outcome, central adjudication or use assessment expertise that is not available in usual care, or the outcome is measured at an earlier time than in usual care.
* Primary analysis: To what extent are all data included in the analysis of the primary outcome? For example, score 5 for a very pragmatic approach using intention to treat with all available data; score 1 for a very explanatory analysis that excludes ineligible post-randomisation participants, includes only completers or those following the treatment protocol.

For each of the 9 domains of PRECIS-2, perform the following steps:
1. Extract 1-3 relevant quotes from the full text.
2. Explain your reasoning in 1 paragraph.
3. Give a score X from 1 (very explanatory) to 5 (very pragmatic) in square brackets like this: "Score: [X]". If the full text does not contain enough information to assess a specific domain, report "Score: [NA]".

Do not provide a final summary paragraph in the end.
