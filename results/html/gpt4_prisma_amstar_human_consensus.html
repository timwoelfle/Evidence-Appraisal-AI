Response: [No]

P3. Introduction / Rationale: Describe the rationale for the review in the context of what is already known.
Quotes: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;During the last two decades the prevalence of childhood and adolescent obesity has grown rapidly in most regions of the world. Despite reports of levelling off in some countries (1–3), childhood obesity and its associated morbidities and costs are considerable and increasing in scale in many countries (4,5), particularly among socioeconomically disadvantaged segments of many populations (6). Obese children and adolescents are more likely than their normal weight peers to suffer endocrine, cardiovascular, pulmonary, orthopaedic, psychosocial and other complications associated with excessive weight, many of which persist into adulthood (7–9). While prevention of obesity must continue to be a policy goal, the treatment of those that are already obese is an issue requiring urgent attention.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: The authors provide a rationale for the review in the context of the increasing prevalence of childhood obesity and its associated health risks.
Response: [Yes]

Response: [No]

P5. Methods / Protocol and registration: Indicate if a review protocol exists, if and where it can be accessed (e.g., Web address), and, if available, provide registration information including registration number.
Quotes: No relevant quotes found.
Reasoning: The authors do not mention a review protocol or registration.
Response: [No]

P6. Methods / Eligibility criteria: Specify study characteristics (e.g., PICOS, length of follow-up) and report characteristics (e.g., years considered, language, publication status) used as criteria for eligibility, giving rationale.
Quotes: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Articles with an abstract in English and full text in Danish, English, French, or Norwegian language were eligible. In addition, subjects had to be 19 years of age. At least one postoperative weight loss measure had to be reported, with a minimum follow-up time of 1 year post surgery. Clinical guidelines, reviews, meta-analyses and commentary on surgical interventions to treat obesity were excluded, as was grey literature such as conference proceedings.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: The authors specify the eligibility criteria for the studies, including language, age of subjects, outcome measures, follow-up time, and types of publications excluded.
Response: [Yes]

Quotes: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Formal meta-analysis was not attempted due to the marked heterogeneity of study designs and outcome measures among the included studies.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: The authors did not perform a meta-analysis due to the heterogeneity of the studies.
Response: [NA]

P15. Methdos / Risk of bias across studies: Specify any assessment of risk of bias that may affect the cumulative evidence (e.g., publication bias, selective reporting within studies).
Quotes: No relevant quotes found.
Reasoning: The authors do not specify any assessment of risk of bias across studies.
Response: [No]

P16. Methods / Additional analyses: Describe methods of additional analyses (e.g., sensitivity or subgroup analyses, meta-regression), if done, indicating which were pre-specified.
Quotes: No relevant quotes found.
Reasoning: The authors do not describe any additional analyses.
Response: [No]

P17. Results / Study selection: Give numbers of studies screened, assessed for eligibility, and included in the review, with reasons for exclusions at each stage, ideally with a flow diagram.
Quotes: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The search strategy yielded 3724 citations of which 273 articles were identified as potentially relevant. Full copies of 247 of these papers were obtained; full copies of the remaining 26 (9.5%) publications of unknown eligibility were unobtainable despite numerous attempts. Examination of the full text of the 247 articles resulted in the exclusion of 210 studies for a variety of reasons including: no original data (n = 112), overlapping data (‘kin’ studies) (n = 13), no paediatric data (n = 65), less than 1 year of follow-up (n = 6), no weight-related surgical outcomes (n = 6), no surgical data (n = 4), foreign language (n = 2), non-bariatric surgery (n = 1) and grey literature (n = 1). Thirty-seven articles (11 case studies, 10 retrospective reviews, 8 cohorts, 3 cost studies, 2 prospective longitudinal trials, 1 longitudinal study, 1 retrospective cohort and 1 randomized controlled trial) were identified and included in the review.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: The authors provide the number of studies screened, assessed for eligibility, and included in the review, with reasons for exclusions at each stage.
Response: [Yes]

Response: [NA]

P22. Results / Risk of bias across studies: Present results of any assessment of risk of bias across studies (see Item P15).
Quotes: No relevant quotes found.
Reasoning: The authors do not present results of any assessment of risk of bias across studies.
Response: [No]

P23. Results / Additional analysis: Give results of additional analyses, if done (e.g., sensitivity or subgroup analyses, meta-regression [see Item P16]).
Quotes: No relevant quotes found.
Reasoning: The authors do not present results of any additional analyses.
Response: [No]

P24. Discussion / Summary of evidence: Summarize the main findings including the strength of evidence for each main outcome; consider their relevance to key groups (e.g., healthcare providers, users, and policy makers).
Quotes: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The existing evidence – although based generally on underpowered, retrospective studies – suggests that bariatric surgery in older children results in significant weight loss and improvements in comorbidities and quality of life.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: The authors summarize the main findings and discuss the strength of the evidence.
Response: [Yes]

P25. Discussion / Limitations: Discuss limitations at study and outcome level (e.g., risk of bias), and at review-level (e.g., incomplete retrieval of identified research, reporting bias).
Quotes: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;This study was challenging due to a number of limitations in the existing literature: Studies assessing the effectiveness of surgical options for obesity in children and adolescents were (apart from one randomized controlled trial) either retrospective or observational, and systematically underpowered. Sample sizes were generally small, with the largest sample containing only 68 patients and the majority of studies reporting data on fewer than 40 patients. Results were not broadly comparable given a lack of consistency across surgeons, procedures and reported outcomes. Accurate information for low frequency outcomes like mortality and complications was sparse. No studies on clinical effectiveness reported on costs, and only one study addressed bariatric surgery cost in children.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: The authors discuss the limitations of the study, including the quality of the included studies, small sample sizes, and lack of cost data.
Response: [Yes]

P26. Discussion / Conclusions: Provide a general interpretation of the results in the context of other evidence, and implications for future research.
Quotes: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;In the context of a general lack of effective tools for primary prevention or behavioural treatment of obesity, surgical treatment may be advocated as a preferred and cost-effective solution for certain children and adolescents. However, postoperative complications, compliance and follow-up may be more problematic in adolescents than adults, and availability of long-term data on safety, effectiveness and cost-effectiveness remains largely unknown. Pending an improvement in the quality of available evidence, an academic approach to child and adolescent bariatric surgery is warranted, and reversible techniques are advisable compared to approaches that permanently alter the anatomy.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: The authors provide a general interpretation of the results and discuss the implications for future research.
Response: [Yes]

P27. Funding: Describe sources of funding for the systematic review and other support (e.g., supply of data); role of funders for the systematic review.
Quotes: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The project that led to this paper was funded by the WHO Health Evidence Network of the World Health Organization. The funder had no role in the design, analysis or interpretation of the study.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: The authors disclose the source of funding for the review and state that the funder had no role in the study.
Response: [Yes]</pre>

P20. Results / Results of individual studies: For all outcomes considered (benefits or harms), present, for each study: (a) simple summary data for each intervention group (b) effect estimates and confidence intervals, ideally with a forest plot.
Quotes: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The studies included 124 patients—96 males (77.4%) and 28 females (22.6%). Of the 124 patients, 110 (88.7%) had undergone previous colostomy, whereas 14 patients (11.2%) had undergone a primary laparoscopic repair without a colostomy. Most patients (80%) had either a high or intermediate ARM.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: The authors presented some summary data for each study, but did not provide effect estimates and confidence intervals.
Response: [No]

P21. Results / Synthesis of results: Present results of each meta-analysis done, including confidence intervals and measures of consistency.
Quotes: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Because of the marked variation in the outcome measures (Table 3), it was not possible to perform a formal meta-analysis.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: The authors did not perform a meta-analysis.
Response: [NA]

P22. Results / Risk of bias across studies: Present results of any assessment of risk of bias across studies (see Item P15).
Quotes: No relevant quotes found.
Reasoning: The authors did not present results of any assessment of risk of bias across studies.
Response: [No]

P23. Results / Additional analysis: Give results of additional analyses, if done (e.g., sensitivity or subgroup analyses, meta-regression [see Item P16]).
Quotes: No relevant quotes found.
Reasoning: The authors did not give results of any additional analyses.
Response: [No]

P24. Discussion / Summary of evidence: Summarize the main findings including the strength of evidence for each main outcome; consider their relevance to key groups (e.g., healthcare providers, users, and policy makers).
Quotes: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;We conclude that there is an urgent need to increase the number of studies reporting LAARP-related outcomes. More efforts are needed by the pediatric surgery community to improve the quality of studies and standardization of reports related ARM.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: The authors summarized the main findings and considered their relevance to the pediatric surgery community.
Response: [Yes]

P25. Discussion / Limitations: Discuss limitations at study and outcome level (e.g., risk of bias), and at review-level (e.g., incomplete retrieval of identified research, reporting bias).
Quotes: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Our study has several limitations. First, this is a systematic review of mainly retrospective data. The quality of such review is only as good as the included studies. Second, because of the wide variation of reported outcomes, no formal meta-analysis and calculation of summary statistics could be performed. Finally, our review only included articles published in English, which may have contributed to a selection bias by omitting relevant articles published in other languages.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: The authors discussed the limitations of their systematic review.
Response: [Yes]

P26. Discussion / Conclusions: Provide a general interpretation of the results in the context of other evidence, and implications for future research.
Quotes: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;We conclude that there is an urgent need to increase the number of studies reporting LAARP-related outcomes. More efforts are needed by the pediatric surgery community to improve the quality of studies and standardization of reports related ARM.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: The authors provided a general interpretation of the results and implications for future research.
Response: [Yes]

P27. Funding: Describe sources of funding for the systematic review and other support (e.g., supply of data); role of funders for the systematic review.
Quotes: No relevant quotes found.
Reasoning: The authors did not describe sources of funding for the systematic review.

Reasoning: The authors discuss the limitations of the study.
Response: [Yes]

P26. Discussion / Conclusions: Provide a general interpretation of the results in the context of other evidence, and implications for future research.
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Despite these limitations, this is one of the largest series report and the first systematic review regarding pediatric EDT. The lack of extensive experience with this resuscitative measure in children and adolescents still prohibits the establishment of guidelines specific to this population.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: The authors provide a general interpretation of the results in the context of other evidence and implications for future research.
Response: [Yes]

P27. Funding: Describe sources of funding for the systematic review and other support (e.g., supply of data); role of funders for the systematic review.
Quote: Not available.
Reasoning: The text does not provide information about the sources of funding for the systematic review.

Abstract Objective To identify methods of improving the evidence base in smaller surgical specialties, using a systematic review of gastroschisis management as an example. Background Operative primary fascial closure (OPFC), and silo placement with staged reduction and delayed closure (SR) are the most commonly used methods of gastroschisis closure. Relative merits of each are unclear. Methods A systematic review and meta-analysis was performed comparing outcomes following OPFC and SR in infants with simple gastroschisis. Primary outcomes of interest were mortality, length of hospitalization and time to full enteral feeding. Results 751 unique articles were identified. Eight met the inclusion criteria. None were randomized controlled trials. 488 infants underwent OPFC and 316 underwent SR. Multiple studies were excluded because they included heterogeneous populations and mixed intervention groups. Length of stay was significantly longer in the SR group (mean difference 8.97 days, 95% CI 2.14–15.80 days), as was number of post-operative days to complete enteral feeding (mean difference 7.19 days, 95%CI 2.01–12.36 days). Mortality was not statistically significantly different, although the odds of death were raised in the SR group (OR 1.96, 95%CI 0.71–5.35).

P3. Introduction / Rationale: Describe the rationale for the review in the context of what is already known.
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;With variation existing around the specifics of management of some of the most common neonatal surgical conditions including oesophageal atresia, gastroschisis and Hirschsprung’s disease, research should be commonplace. Yet despite these fertile conditions for research, for these three conditions, only fourteen prospectively registered clinical trials and two systematic reviews could be identified on a search of the major registries at the time of writing (Table 1). Whilst both the low incidence of many of the studied conditions, and the difficulties in gaining ethical approval are at least in part responsible for the lack of paediatric surgical research, we do not believe that they account for the whole story.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: The authors provide a rationale for the review in the context of the current state of research in the field.
Response: [Yes]

P4. Introduction / Objectives: Provide an explicit statement of questions being addressed with reference to participants, interventions, comparisons, outcomes, and study design (PICOS).
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The aim of this study, therefore, was to perform a systematic review of the literature comparing outcomes of infants with simple gastroschisis following either OPFC or SR. From this study we aimed to identify some of the reasons why research in paediatric surgery is currently largely unable to provide a strong evidence base to inform clinical practice.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: The authors provide an explicit statement of the research question, including the participants (infants with simple gastroschisis), interventions (OPFC or SR), and outcomes (reasons why research in paediatric surgery is currently largely unable to provide a strong evidence base to inform clinical practice).
Response: [Yes]

P5. Methods / Protocol and registration: Indicate if a review protocol exists, if and where it can be accessed (e.g., Web address), and, if available, provide registration information including registration number.
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The review was conducted according to a pre-specified protocol. The protocol was registered on the Prospero International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (CRD42012003241).&quot;</span>
Reasoning: The authors indicate that a review protocol exists and provide the registration number.
Response: [Yes]

P6. Methods / Eligibility criteria: Specify study characteristics (e.g., PICOS, length of follow-up) and report characteristics (e.g., years considered, language, publication status) used as criteria for eligibility, giving rationale.
Quote: <span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 99.9%):

- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Abstract Introduction Esophageal strictures refractory to conservative treatment represent a major problem in children. The application of Mitomycin C to the site of stricture has been introduced, but the experience with this novel approach remains very limited. Methods Systematic review of publications on the topical application of Mitomycin C in children with persistent esophageal stricture. Results We identified 11 publications including 31 cases. The underlying cause of stricture was caustic ingestion in 19 (61.2%), esophageal surgery in 7 (22.6%), and others in 5 children (16.2%). The median age of the patients was 48 months (range 4 to 276 months). In the majority of cases cotton pledgets soaked in solution of Mitomycin C were applied endoscopically. Various other techniques such as drug-eluting stents were used. Mitomycin C was applied from 1 to 12 times within intervals from 1 to 12 weeks. The concentrations of Mitomycin C varied considerably between 0.1 and 1 mg/mL. After a mean follow-up time of 22 (6 to 60) months complete relief of symptoms was reported for 21 children (67.7%), and 6 (19.4%) had a partial relief. In four children (12.9%) Mitomycin C treatment failed. No direct or indirect adverse effects were reported. Conclusion The short-term results of topical Mitomycin C application for refractory esophageal stricture reported in the literature are very encouraging. Prospective studies are mandatory to determine the optimal time points, dosage, and modalities of treatment before a recommendation can be given.&quot;</span>

This review was conducted to compare the clinical and cost effectiveness of laparoscopic and open surgical approaches for a variety of surgical indications in pediatric populations. Method/ Design: A computerized comprehensive search supplemented by a manual review of the literature was performed for all peer-reviewed publications comparing laparoscopic and open appendectomy, fundoplication and hernia repair cohorts. Outcomes of interest were length of stay (LOS), operating room (OR) time, complication rates and total hospital costs; aggregation of outcome rates was performed with the Mantel-Haenszel method. Results: A total of 24 articles were identified that met the search and inclusion criteria. LOS was found to be significantly reduced in favor of the laparoscopic approach, with a weighted mean difference of − 1.44 days, although the OR time was significantly increased, with a weighted mean difference of + 12.8 min. Laparoscopic intervention was associated with a significantly reduced complication rate compared to the open approach (10.6 vs. 15.6 % ). Total hospital costs of the laparoscopic approaches were found to be insignificantly increased compared to the open techniques. Conclusion: This review further supports the use of minimally invasive surgery (MIS) in pediatric populations, demonstrating that the three types laparoscopic procedures reviewed resulted in better patient outcomes compared to open procedures, in the form of reduced LOS and overall complication rates. Increased utilization of this approach may prove beneficial to pediatric patients.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: The abstract provides a structured summary of the review.
Response: [Yes]

P3. Introduction / Rationale: Describe the rationale for the review in the context of what is already known.
Quotes: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Introduction & Pediatric surgeons were among the pioneers of laparoscopic surgery in the early 1970s, but the vast potential of this “ minimally invasive ” approach to treat neonates, infants and children with surgical conditions has lagged behind its adult counterpart and has only recently begun to be realized [20] . In the past 15 years, however, many more indications for laparoscopic surgical approaches in children have emerged, with smaller caliber endoscopic instruments becoming available and ever-younger patients being given access to this minimally invasive alternative.&quot;</span>

Quotes: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The validity of the results of this review largely depends on the validity of the included studies. Many of the included studies failed to take all the steps necessary to avoid bias. There may well be an inherent bias in the analyses, which are likely to favor the ‘newer’ MIS/laparoscopic technique. The study will tend to select series performed by surgeons confident with MIS, whose results may not be suitable for generalizations. Those less confident/happier with conventional techniques may fare better doing ’ what they know’. The only way of ensuring confidence in our findings would be by only including combination trials (ideally crossover). Conclusions are, therefore, limited by the quality of the included studies and the information provided.&quot;</span>

Abstract Purpose: Laparoscopic varicocelectomy has gained popularity in recent years. The aim of this study was to identify clinical evidence about the reliability of this technique in the recent literature. Methods: We performed a Medline search for articles published during the last 10 years, using the key words “varicocele,” “treatment,” and “adolescent.” As limits, we used last 10 years, adolescent, clinical trials, randomized controlled trials, meta-analysis, and multicenter retrospective and prospective studies. The results were investigated in recurrence and hydrocele formation. Results: We pooled 37 studies, but 26 of these were excluded because they were neither relevant nor concerned an adolescent population. Meta-analysis showed that there was no statistical difference between laparoscopic surgery and open surgery in recurrence rate and postoperative hydrocele rate. In the laparoscopic group, the incidence of recurrence was higher in the patients undergoing artery ligation compared to patients undergoing artery and venous ligation. Furthermore, a lower rate of postoperative hydrocele was recorded in patients undergoing dye injections before laparoscopic ligation. Conclusions: Meta-analysis and literature analysis showed that the results after laparoscopic varicocelectomy are comparable to other surgical procedures. The laparoscopic approach has the advantage to treat simultaneously bilateral varicocele.' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;Abstract: Purpose: Laparoscopic varicocelectomy has gained popularity in recent years.

P3. Introduction / Rationale: Describe the rationale for the review in the context of what is already known.
- Quote: <span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 99.3%):

Varicocele is generally considered the most common correctable cause of male infertility [1,2]. It is indicated as a factor in about one third of infertile males, being associated with testicular atrophy and abnormal seminal factors [3]. Varicocele occurs in 10% to 15% of children and adolescents [4,5]. Several treatment options have been used, including spermatic vein sclerotherapy or embolization, open inguinal ligation of the spermatic vein, subinguinal microscopic varicocelectomy, and, most recently, laparoscopy, but the ideal method for varicocele treatment is still controversial ⁎' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;Varicocele is generally considered the most common correctable cause of male infertility [1,2].

P1. Title: Identify the report as a systematic review, meta-analysis, or both.
- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Does Preputial reconstruction increase complication rate of hypospadias repair? 20-Year systematic review and Meta-analysis&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The title clearly identifies the report as a systematic review and meta-analysis.
- Answer: [Yes]

P2. Abstract / Structured summary: Provide a structured summary including, as applicable: background; objectives; data sources; study eligibility criteria, participants, and interventions; study appraisal and synthesis methods; results; limitations; conclusions and implications of key findings; systematic review registration number.
- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;introduction: We performed a systematic review of the literature on preputial reconstruction (PR) during hypospadias repair to determine the cumulative risk of preputial skin complications and the influence of PR on urethroplasty complications, namely, fistula formation and overall reoperation rate of the repair.&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The abstract provides a structured summary of the review, including the background, objectives, data sources, study eligibility criteria, participants, interventions, study appraisal and synthesis methods, results, limitations, and conclusions.

P3. Introduction / Rationale: Describe the rationale for the review in the context of what is already known.
- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Preputial asymmetry is one of the components of hypospadias. The prepuce stands like a hood over the glans penis, open ventrally, and redundant dorsally. Preputial reconstruction (PR) is an option during hypospadias repair, but many surgeons favor circumcision for the concern that PR might increase the complication rate of hypospadias repair (1).&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The authors provide a rationale for the review in the context of existing knowledge.
- Answer: [Yes]

P4. Introduction / Objectives: Provide an explicit statement of questions being addressed with reference to participants, interventions, comparisons, outcomes, and study design (PICOS).
- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;We performed a systematic review of the literature on PR during hypospadias repair to determine the cumulative risk of specific complications related to the procedure. Moreover, we performed a meta-analysis of studies comparing urethroplasty complications and reoperation rates in patients undergoing hypospadias repair associated with PR vs. circumcision to test the hypothesis that circumcision is associated with a lower rate of complications related to the urethroplasty, namely, fistula rate, and a lower reoperation rate.&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The authors provide an explicit statement of the research questions being addressed, with reference to participants, interventions, comparisons, outcomes, and study design.
- Answer: [Yes]

- Response: [Yes]

P2. Abstract / Structured summary: Provide a structured summary including, as applicable: background; objectives; data sources; study eligibility criteria, participants, and interventions; study appraisal and synthesis methods; results; limitations; conclusions and implications of key findings; systematic review registration number.
- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Abstract The ideal management of cryptorchidism is a highly debated topic within the field of pediatric surgery. The optimal timing of orchiopexy is particularly unclear, as existing literature reports mixed recommendations. The aim of this study was to determine, based on a systematic review, the most favorable age at which orchiopexy should be performed. We conducted a systematic search of MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, and the Cochrane Library to find relevant articles. Two researchers quality assessed each study using the following tools: AMSTAR (systematic reviews), Jadad (RCTs), and MINORS (non-RCTs). We developed a conclusion based on the highest quality studies. We found one relevant systematic review, one RCT, and 30 non-RCTs. Fertility potential was greatest when orchiopexy was performed before 1 year of age. Additionally, orchiopexy before 10–11 years may protect against the increased risk of testicular cancer associated with cryptorchidism. Orchiopexy should not be performed before 6 months of age, as testes may descend spontaneously during the first few months of life. The highest quality evidence recommends orchiopexy between 6 and 12 months of age. Surgery during this timeframe may optimize fertility potential and protect against testicular malignancy in children with cryptorchidism.&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The abstract provides a structured summary of the study.
- Response: [Yes]

Abstract Aim: Transanal endorectal pull-through (TERPT) has become popular for single-stage treatment of Hirschsprung&#39;s disease. The benefitsof TERPT over the conventional transabdominal approach(TAB)are still unclear. We performed a comprehensive meta-analysis comparing the clinical outcomes of TERPT and TAB. Methods: Original articles published from 1998 to 2012 were searched from Medline, Embase, and Cochrane databases. Randomized controlled trials (RCT) and observational clinical studies (OCS) comparing TERPT and TAB were included. Outcomes evaluated included operative time, hospital stay and incidence of postoperative incontinence/soiling, constipation and enterocolitis. Pooled odds ratios (OR) were calculated for dichotomous variables; pooled mean differences (MD) were measured for continuous variables. Results: Of 93 studies, 1 RCT and 11 OCS were included, comprising 444 cases of TERPT and 348 cases of TAB (215 Soave, 94 Duhamel, 24 Swenson, 15 Rehbein procedures). TERPT had shorter operative time (MD = −57.85 min; 95% confidence interval [CI], −83.11 to − 32.60; P b 0.00001) and hospital stay (MD = −7.06 days; 95% CI, −10.95 to −3.16; P = 0.0004). TERPT had less postoperative incontinence/ soiling (OR = 0.58; 95% CI 0.37–0.90; P = 0.01) and constipation (OR = 0.49; 95% CI 0.30–0.81; P = 0.005). There was no difference in incidence of postoperative enterocolitis. Conclusion: TERPT is superior to TAB in operative time, hospital stay, postoperative incontinence and constipation. However, more randomized controlled trials are necessary to verify the benefit of TERPT for Hirschsprung&#39;s disease.' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;Abstract: Aim: Transanal endorectal pull-through (TERPT) has become popular for single-stage treatment of Hirschsprung's disease.

Since the first description of aganglionosis in the myenteric plexus of the distal colon in congenital megacolon by Dalla Valle et al., a variety of surgical procedures have been described in an attempt to restore normal bowel function in Hirschsprung&#39;s disease (HD) [1–6]. For many years, surgical treatment of HD involved staged procedures; an initial diverting enterostomy was followed by definitive transabdominal pullthrough surgery with subsequent closure of the colostomy. These multi-stage surgeries have gradually been replaced by the primary pull-through surgery in many centers [7].' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;Since the first description of aganglionosis in the myenteric plexus of the distal colon in congenital megacolon by Dalla Valle et al., a variety of surgical procedures have been described in an attempt to restore normal bowel function in Hirschsprung's disease (HD) [1–6].

- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;TERPT had shorter operative time (MD = −57.85 min; 95% confidence interval [CI], −83.11 to − 32.60; P b 0.00001) and hospital stay (MD = −7.06 days; 95% CI, −10.95 to −3.16; P = 0.0004). TERPT had less postoperative incontinence/ soiling (OR = 0.58; 95% CI 0.37–0.90; P = 0.01) and constipation (OR = 0.49; 95% CI 0.30–0.81; P = 0.005). There was no difference in incidence of postoperative enterocolitis.&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The authors presented results of each meta-analysis done, including confidence intervals.
- Answer: [Yes]

P22. Results / Risk of bias across studies: Present results of any assessment of risk of bias across studies (see Item P15).
- Quote: No relevant quote found.
- Reasoning: The authors did not present results of any assessment of risk of bias across studies.
- Answer: [No]

P23. Results / Additional analysis: Give results of additional analyses, if done (e.g., sensitivity or subgroup analyses, meta-regression [see Item P16]).
- Quote: No relevant quote found.
- Reasoning: The authors did not give results of additional analyses.
- Answer: [No]

P24. Discussion / Summary of evidence: Summarize the main findings including the strength of evidence for each main outcome; consider their relevance to key groups (e.g., healthcare providers, users, and policy makers).
- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Our meta-analysis suggests that the TERPT is superior to the conventional TAB pull-through for Hirschsprung's disease.&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The authors summarized the main findings and considered their relevance to healthcare providers.
- Answer: [Yes]

P25. Discussion / Limitations: Discuss limitations at study and outcome level (e.g., risk of bias), and at review-level (e.g., incomplete retrieval of identified research, reporting bias).
- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Our results appear to favor TERPT for most postoperative outcomes. However, this result must be interpreted cautiously due to the limitations of this study. The lack of randomized trials is a key problem.&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The authors discussed limitations at the study and review level.
- Answer: [Yes]

P26. Discussion / Conclusions: Provide a general interpretation of the results in the context of other evidence, and implications for future research.
- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;In conclusion, compared to TAB, TERPT is associated with shorter operative time, hospital stay and lesser postoperative incontinence and constipation. However, the lack of large prospective studies of robust design cannot be trivialized. More randomized controlled trials are necessary to verify the benefit of TERPT for Hirschsprung's disease. Longer follow-up is also needed to determine bowel function and quality of life in patients who undergo TERPT.&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The authors provided a general interpretation of the results in the context of other evidence, and implications for future research.
- Answer: [Yes]

P27. Funding: Describe sources of funding for the systematic review and other support (e.g., supply of data); role of funders for the systematic review.
- Quote: No relevant quote found.
- Reasoning: The authors did not describe sources of funding for the systematic review.
- Answer: [No]</pre>

- Response: [No]

P19. Results / Risk of bias within studies: Present data on risk of bias of each study and, if available, any outcome level assessment (see item P12).
- Quote: No relevant quote found.
- Reasoning: The authors do not present data on the risk of bias within studies.
- Response: [No]

P20. Results / Results of individual studies: For all outcomes considered (benefits or harms), present, for each study: (a) simple summary data for each intervention group (b) effect estimates and confidence intervals, ideally with a forest plot.
- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The median success rate was 71% (range 46e100) in the primary group and 75% (range 25e100) in the secondary group.&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The authors present summary data for each group, but they do not provide effect estimates and confidence intervals for individual studies.
- Response: [No]

P21. Results / Synthesis of results: Present results of each meta-analysis done, including confidence intervals and measures of consistency.
- Quote: No relevant quote found.
- Reasoning: This is a systematic review without a meta-analysis, so this item is not applicable.

- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The study found success rates of 71% for primary endopyelotomy and 75% for secondary procedures, neither of which compare favourably with established outcome data for open and laparoscopic pyeloplasty.&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The authors summarize the main findings of the review.
- Response: [Yes]

P25. Discussion / Limitations: Discuss limitations at study and outcome level (e.g., risk of bias), and at review-level (e.g., incomplete retrieval of identified research, reporting bias).
- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Finally, the limitations of this review must be born in mind. The review includes reports that cover a wide time period during which both diagnostic modalities and operative techniques have evolved.&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The authors discuss the limitations of the review.
- Response: [Yes]

P26. Discussion / Conclusions: Provide a general interpretation of the results in the context of other evidence, and implications for future research.

- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;All studies were retrospective case series (meta-analysis was therefore not formally undertaken other than cumulative totals and percentages of data included).&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The authors state that they used cumulative totals and percentages as summary measures.
- Response: [Yes]

P14. Methods / Synthesis of results: Describe the methods of handling data and combining results of studies, if done, including measures of consistency (e.g., I2) for each meta-analysis.
- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;All studies were retrospective case series (meta-analysis was therefore not formally undertaken other than cumulative totals and percentages of data included).&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The authors describe how they handled and combined the data from the included studies.
- Response: [Yes]

P15. Methdos / Risk of bias across studies: Specify any assessment of risk of bias that may affect the cumulative evidence (e.g., publication bias, selective reporting within studies).
- Quote: Not applicable.
- Reasoning: The authors do not mention assessing for risk of bias across studies.

P16. Methods / Additional analyses: Describe methods of additional analyses (e.g., sensitivity or subgroup analyses, meta-regression), if done, indicating which were pre-specified.
- Quote: Not applicable.
- Reasoning: The authors do not mention conducting any additional analyses.
- Response: [NA]

P17. Results / Study selection: Give numbers of studies screened, assessed for eligibility, and included in the review, with reasons for exclusions at each stage, ideally with a flow diagram.
- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Six hundred seventy-three citations were retrieved through the full literature search, of which there were 226 duplicates. Nineteen studies were included for systematic review.&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The authors provide the number of studies screened, assessed for eligibility, and included in the review, but they do not provide reasons for exclusions at each stage or a flow diagram.
- Response: [No]

P18. Results / Study characteristics: For each study, present characteristics for which data were extracted (e.g., study size, PICOS, follow-up period) and provide the citations.
- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Table 2 summarizes the main characteristics of the 19 included studies.&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The authors provide a table summarizing the characteristics of the included studies.
- Response: [Yes]

P19. Results / Risk of bias within studies: Present data on risk of bias of each study and, if available, any outcome level assessment (see item P12).
- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Quality of manuscripts was evaluated by using the Methodological Index for Nonrandomized Studies (MINORS) criteria.&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The authors mention assessing the risk of bias within studies using the MINORS criteria, but they do not present the data on risk of bias for each study.
- Response: [No]

P20. Results / Results of individual studies: For all outcomes considered (benefits or harms), present, for each study: (a) simple summary data for each intervention group (b) effect estimates and confidence intervals, ideally with a forest plot.
- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;These 9 studies included a cumulative total of 414 patients managed expectantly, that is, ‘‘asymptomatic patients’’ in whom no IRA screening was undertaken (group A), 191 cases in whom screening was performed routinely (group B), and 92 patients who were considered ‘‘symptomatic’’ of potential rotational anomalies and therefore underwent imaging or laparotomy (group C).&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The authors present summary data for each group of patients in the included studies, but they do not provide effect estimates and confidence intervals for each study.
- Response: [No]

P21. Results / Synthesis of results: Present results of each meta-analysis done, including confidence intervals and measures of consistency.
- Quote: Not applicable.
- Reasoning: The authors did not perform a meta-analysis.
- Response: [NA]

P22. Results / Risk of bias across studies: Present results of any assessment of risk of bias across studies (see Item P15).
- Quote: Not applicable.
- Reasoning: The authors do not mention assessing for risk of bias across studies.
- Response: [No]

P23. Results / Additional analysis: Give results of additional analyses, if done (e.g., sensitivity or subgroup analyses, meta-regression [see Item P16]).
- Quote: Not applicable.
- Reasoning: The authors do not mention conducting any additional analyses.
- Response: [NA]

P24. Discussion / Summary of evidence: Summarize the main findings including the strength of evidence for each main outcome; consider their relevance to key groups (e.g., healthcare providers, users, and policy makers).
- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;This systematic review shows that ‘‘asymptomatic patients’’ with heterotaxy are at a low risk of developing IRA-related complications. Of 414 patients managed expectantly, only a single patient (0.24%) developed symptoms directly attributable to IRA during the total follow-up period.&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The authors summarize the main findings of the review and discuss their relevance.
- Response: [Yes]

P25. Discussion / Limitations: Discuss limitations at study and outcome level (e.g., risk of bias), and at review-level (e.g., incomplete retrieval of identified research, reporting bias).
- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;We fully acknowledge that there are some limitations with the present study. Follow-up reporting data in studies we analyzed was sometimes poor. This may influence long-term outcome(s) of both a ‘‘watchful waiting’’ policy and operative intervention. Adequate reporting in studies was thus by no means always satisfactory.&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The authors discuss the limitations of the review, including issues with follow-up reporting data and the quality of reporting in the included studies.
- Response: [Yes]

P26. Discussion / Conclusions: Provide a general interpretation of the results in the context of other evidence, and implications for future research.
- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Given the fragility of this patient cohort—with cardiac comorbidity(s)—many can therefore avoid an unnecessary Ladd’s operation.&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The authors provide a general interpretation of the results and discuss their implications.
- Response: [Yes]

P27. Funding: Describe sources of funding for the systematic review and other support (e.g., supply of data); role of funders for the systematic review.
- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;No funding was sought or received for this work.&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The authors disclose that they did not receive any funding for the review.
- Response: [Yes]</pre>

There was 90% agreement on identification of articles and discrepancies were resolved by consensus, or arbitrated by a third author (E.K.M.).&quot;</span>
Reasoning: The authors mention that two authors independently conducted the literature search and data extraction, and any disagreements were resolved by consensus or a third author.
Response: [Yes]

A3. Was a comprehensive literature search performed?
Quotes: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Systematic literature searches were undertaken of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), PubMed, Ovid Medline and EMBASE electronic databases using the following search strategy using the following Medical Subject Headings (MeSH): (‘Surgery, Computer-Assisted’ OR ‘robotics’ OR ‘da Vinci’ OR ‘telerobotic’ OR ‘telesurgery’ OR ‘robotic surgery’) AND (‘Pediatrics’ OR ‘Infant’ OR ‘Child’ OR ‘Adolescent’) AND (‘Kidney’ OR ‘Pelvi-ureteric Junction Obstruction’ OR ‘Pyeloplasty’). The search was conducted up to December 2013. The primary search was supplemented with searches of: i) PubMed related articles feature, ii) clinicaltrials.gov registry using the keyword ‘pyeloplasty’, and iii) abstracts of the International Pediatric Endosurgery Group Annual Congresses (2002–2013), the AUA Annual Meetings (2006–2013), Section of Urology Program of the American Association of Pediatrics National Conference (2007–2012), and World Congress of Endourology (2008–2013).&quot;</span>
Reasoning: The authors performed a comprehensive literature search using multiple databases and supplementary strategies.
Response: [Yes]

A4. Was the status of publication (i.e. grey literature) used as an inclusion criterion?
Quotes: No specific quotes related to this criterion.
Reasoning: The authors do not mention whether they included grey literature in their search.
Response: [No]

A5. Was a list of studies (included and excluded) provided?
Quotes: No specific quotes related to this criterion.
Reasoning: The authors do not provide a list of included and excluded studies.
Response: [No]

A6. Were the characteristics of the included studies provided?
Quotes: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;In all, 12 observational studies met inclusion criteria, reporting outcomes of 384 RAP, 131 LP, and 164 OP procedures. No randomised controlled trials were identified.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: The authors provide some information about the characteristics of the included studies, but not in a detailed or aggregated form.
Response: [No]

A7. Was the scientific quality of the included studies assessed and documented?
Quotes: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The methodological quality of studies was appraised using a star-based modified Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (mNOS) that considers patient selection, inter-group comparability, and outcome assessment (maximum 3, 10, and 2 stars respectively; total out of 15) [6].&quot;</span>
Reasoning: The authors mention that they assessed the quality of the included studies using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale.
Response: [Yes]

A8. Was the scientific quality of the included studies used appropriately in formulating conclusions?
Quotes: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The median (range) mNOS score was 9 (4–14) (Table 4).&quot;</span>
Reasoning: The authors mention the quality scores of the included studies, but do not explicitly state how these scores were used in formulating their conclusions.
Response: [No]

A9. Were the methods used to combine the findings of studies appropriate?
Quotes: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Statistical analysis was conducted using Review Manager ® Version 5.1.7 for Windows (The Cochrane Collaboration, Software Update, Oxford, UK) and STATA v.11 statistical analysis software (StataCorp LP, TX, USA). A weighted random-effects model was used for all analyses.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: The authors describe the statistical methods used to combine the findings of the included studies.
Response: [Yes]

A10. Was the likelihood of publication bias assessed?
Quotes: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Risk of publication bias was assessed by visual inspection of funnel plots in addition to statistical estimation with both Begg and Mazumdar’s test and Egger’s test for small study effects.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: The authors mention that they assessed the likelihood of publication bias using funnel plots and statistical tests.
Response: [Yes]

A11. Was the conflict of interest included?
Quotes: No specific quotes related to this criterion.
Reasoning: The authors do not mention any conflicts of interest for the systematic review or the included studies.
Response: [No]

Abstract Background: This meta-analysis was designed to investigate the safety and efficacy of single-incision laparoscopic appendicectomy (SILA) and three-incision laparoscopic appendicectomy (TILA) in the treatment of appendicitis. Materials and Methods: Studies published since 1992 that compared SILA versus TILA in laparoscopic appendicectomy were collected. Data on operative parameters, postoperative recovery, postoperative pain and complications, and hospitalization costs for SILA and TILA were meta-analyzed using fixedeffect and random-effect models. Results: Seventeen studies (1 randomized controlled trial and 16 retrospective studies) that included 1809 patients were studied. Of these patients, 793 and 1016 had undergone SILA and TILA, respectively. There was significantly shorter length of hospital stay; however, there were evidently higher conversion rate, and perhaps higher surgical difficulty and hospitalization costs for SILA compared with TILA. Other outcome variables such as operative time, blood loss, time to first oral intake, postoperative pain and complications were not found to be statistically significant for either group. Conclusions: Compared with TILA, SILA has the advantage of shorter hospital stay, and it can achieve comparable operative time, blood loss, postoperative recovery, postoperative pain and complications with TILA. The drawback is that SILA is associated with higher conversion rate, and perhaps higher surgical difficulty and hospitalization costs. Whether it can achieve improvement in cosmesis remains to be confirmed.' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;Abstract: Background: This meta-analysis was designed to investigate the safety and efficacy of single-incision laparoscopic appendicectomy (SILA) and three-incision laparoscopic appendicectomy (TILA) in the treatment of appendicitis.

Abstract Introduction Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) has gained enormous acceptance among pediatric surgeons. However, most studies on advantages of VATS do not reach a high level of evidence. According to a recent classification of the Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine (CEBM), studies can be classified into Levels 1 to 5 in order of descending quality. We aimed to identify comparative studies investigating VATS versus open procedures in pediatric surgery and to classify publications according to the CEBM criteria.' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;Abstract: Introduction Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) has gained enormous acceptance among pediatric surgeons.

<pre>
<AMSTAR>
A1. Was an 'a priori' design provided?
- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;We conducted a systematic review to determine whether single or 2-stage Fowler-Stephens orchiopexy results in better testicular viability.&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The research question and inclusion criteria are established before the conduct of the review.
- Response: [Yes]

A2. Was there duplicate study selection and data extraction?
- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Each author was allocated roughly 10 articles, and independently abstracted the data and assessed the quality of the reports.&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The authors mention that data extraction was done independently by each author.
- Response: [Yes]

A3. Was a comprehensive literature search performed?
- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;We searched several electronic databases, including MEDLINE®, EMBASE®, CINAHL®, Cochrane Central Register of Control Trials, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects and ACP Journal Club®.&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The authors searched multiple databases and provided the names of these databases.
- Response: [Yes]

- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Reference lists of the selected articles were hand searched for relevant citations, as was potentially relevant gray literature, which consists of studies either not published or not indexed in major databases.&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The authors searched for grey literature and included it in their review.
- Response: [Yes]

A5. Was a list of studies (included and excluded) provided?
- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;A total of 1,807 potentially relevant articles were retrieved from the initial electronic database search and an additional 13 studies from the gray literature search.&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The authors mention the number of articles retrieved but do not provide a list of included and excluded studies.
- Response: [No]

A6. Were the characteristics of the included studies provided?
- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;No included study was a RCT, and only 4 of 61 articles mentioned how or if statistical analysis was performed.&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The authors provide some information about the characteristics of the included studies, but not in a comprehensive manner.
- Response: [No]

A7. Was the scientific quality of the included studies assessed and documented?
- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Each author was allocated roughly 10 articles, and independently abstracted the data and assessed the quality of the reports.&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The authors mention that they assessed the quality of the included studies.
- Response: [Yes]

A8. Was the scientific quality of the included studies used appropriately in formulating conclusions?
- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;However, the level of evidence of the studies was low and a study of a more robust design such as a randomized control trial should be performed to evaluate and compare the efficacies of these therapies in the pediatric population.&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The authors considered the quality of the included studies when formulating their conclusions.
- Response: [Yes]

A9. Were the methods used to combine the findings of studies appropriate?
- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Meta-analysis using weighted mean difference (random effects model) was conducted using R software (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Wien, Austria).&quot;</span>

Among the 36 articles (751 testes) including success rates of 2-stage FSO the pooled estimate of success rate was 85% (95% CI 81 to 90) and the I2 was 43% (fig. 3).&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The authors present summary data and effect estimates for each study, and use forest plots.
- Response: [Yes]

P21. Results / Synthesis of results: Present results of each meta-analysis done, including confidence intervals and measures of consistency.
- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The pooled estimate of success rates was 80% for single stage Fowler-Stephens orchiopexy (95% CI 75 to 86) and 85% for 2-stage Fowler-Stephens orchiopexy (95% CI 81 to 90).&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The authors present the results of the meta-analysis, including confidence intervals.
- Response: [Yes]

P22. Results / Risk of bias across studies: Present results of any assessment of risk of bias across studies (see Item P15).
- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The funnel plot was roughly symmetrical, suggesting that publication bias was unlikely a significant factor.&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The authors present the results of an assessment of risk of bias across studies.
- Response: [Yes]

P23. Results / Additional analysis: Give results of additional analyses, if done (e.g., sensitivity or subgroup analyses, meta-regression [see Item P16]).
- Quote: Not available.
- Reasoning: The full text provided does not mention any additional analyses.
- Response: [No]

P24. Discussion / Summary of evidence: Summarize the main findings including the strength of evidence for each main outcome; consider their relevance to key groups (e.g., healthcare providers, users, and policy makers).
- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Based on the results of this review, both approaches have a fairly high success rate, although 2-stage FSO appears to carry a higher rate of success over the single stage procedure, defined as postoperative viability of the testis (85% vs 80%, OR 2 in favor of 2-stage).&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The authors summarize the main findings and the strength of evidence for each main outcome.
- Response: [Yes]

P25. Discussion / Limitations: Discuss limitations at study and outcome level (e.g., risk of bias), and at review-level (e.g., incomplete retrieval of identified research, reporting bias).
- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The strength of this study was limited by several factors. This systematic review failed to identify any RCTs comparing success rates of single vs 2-stage FSO. The studies included consisted almost entirely of retrospective cohort or case series, with only 16 reports comparing single to 2-stage repair.&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The authors discuss the limitations of the study.
- Response: [Yes]

P26. Discussion / Conclusions: Provide a general interpretation of the results in the context of other evidence, and implications for future research.
- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;However, the level of evidence of the studies was low and a study of a more robust design such as a randomized control trial should be performed to evaluate and compare the efficacies of these therapies in the pediatric population.&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The authors provide a general interpretation of the results and implications for future research.
- Response: [Yes]

P27. Funding: Describe sources of funding for the systematic review and other support (e.g., supply of data); role of funders for the systematic review.
- Quote: Not available.
- Reasoning: The full text provided does not mention any sources of funding for the systematic review.

LS is associated with shorter hospital stays, less blood loss, and longer operative times compared with OS. Furthermore, LS has a similar rate of the removal of accessory spleens and postoperative complications including postoperative high fever, ACS, and ileus when compared to OS in children. However, none of the ten studies included in our meta-analysis were randomized. Randomized controlled trials of high quality are definitely necessary and needed in the future to make our results more convincing and conclusive.&quot;</span>

Abstract Purpose Most patients with Hirschsprung’s disease (HD) have a satisfactory outcome after pull-through (PT) operation. However, some children continue to have persistent bowel symptoms after the initial operation and may require redo PT. Redo PT operation in HD is usually indicated for anastomotic strictures or residual aganglionosis (RA). We designed this meta-analysis to determine the incidence and outcome of RA among patients with HD following PT operation.' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;Abstract: Purpose Most patients with Hirschsprung’s disease (HD) have a satisfactory outcome after pull-through (PT) operation. However, some children continue to have persistent bowel symptoms after the initial operation and may require redo PT.

A1. Was an 'a priori' design provided?
- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;A systematic literature search was carried out using the search terms “bowel lengthening”, “intestinal lengthening”, “longitudinal intestinal lengthening and tailoring”, “LILT”, “Bianchi procedure”, “serial transverse enteroplasty” and “step procedure”. The last search was done on December, 10th, 2012.&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The authors describe a systematic literature search, but do not mention a pre-established protocol or research objectives.
- Answer: [No]

A2. Was there duplicate study selection and data extraction?
- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;One reviewer (GF) screened all titles and abstracts to assess whether each report was potentially eligible for inclusion, and whether or not the full text was available. Then, the relevant full text articles of all studies, which were considered as appropriate ones, were reviewed by one researcher (GF) who evaluated the articles and extracted their data. Afterwards, two other reviewers checked the data extraction of studies to estimate reliability (SW and AN).&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The authors describe a process where one reviewer screened and extracted data, and two other reviewers checked the data extraction.
- Answer: [Yes]

A3. Was a comprehensive literature search performed?
- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;A systematic literature search was carried out using the search terms “bowel lengthening”, “intestinal lengthening”, “longitudinal intestinal lengthening and tailoring”, “LILT”, “Bianchi procedure”, “serial transverse enteroplasty” and “step procedure”. The last search was done on December, 10th, 2012. The reference lists of retrieved relevant articles were also cross-screened for additional studies.&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The authors describe a systematic literature search with multiple search terms and cross-screening of reference lists, but do not specify the databases used.
- Answer: [No]

A4. Was the status of publication (i.e. grey literature) used as an inclusion criterion?
- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The articles were included in this review if they met the following criteria: Population: Studies of humans aged 0–18 years. Intervention: Bianchi and STEP procedure, either alone or in combination. Type of study: All study designs were eligible for inclusion. Case series with 1 or more cases were included.&quot;</span>

Abstract Purpose: To compare LILT and STEP, the two principal procedures to lengthen the native bowel in children with a short bowel syndrome (SBS), by discussing the indications and presenting the outcome from published data. Methods: A review of literature was performed. N = 39 publications were reviewed. Results: For LILT and STEP, failure to achieve intestinal autonomy by conservative therapy represents the main indication, and end-stage liver disease the main contraindication. A sufficiently dilated intestinal segment is a common anatomical precondition for both procedures. STEP can be performed on shorter intestinal segments and on intricate segments such as the duodenum, which is technically not feasible for LILT. Both procedures have a similar extent of intestinal lengthening (approximately 70%) and result in improvement of enteral nutrition and reversal of complications of parenteral nutrition. STEP seems to have a lower mortality and overall progression to transplantation. Conclusions: STEP and LILT are both accepted procedures for non-transplant surgical management of SBS in children. The outcome after STEP seems to be more favourable, but larger series are needed to further assess accurate selection of eligible patients and to estimate effectiveness of procedures. A considerably higher number of cases for evaluation might be accomplished through the widespread use of a centralised registry.' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;Abstract: Purpose: To compare LILT and STEP, the two principal procedures to lengthen the native bowel in children with a short bowel syndrome (SBS), by discussing the indications and presenting the outcome from published data.

P3. Introduction / Rationale: Describe the rationale for the review in the context of what is already known.
- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Short bowel syndrome (SBS) is a serious disorder in which the intestinal resorptive capacity is insufficient to provide an adequate alimentary supply [1]. The estimated incidence in children is 24.5 per 100,000 live births with a higher incidence reported in preterm infants [2]. The estimated mortality is 2/100,000 population/year for children with SBS under 4 years [2] and 37.5% of neonates with SBS [3]. SBS in children occurs after congenital or acquired loss of part of the intestine [4], in most cases due to gastroschisis, necrotizing enterocolitis, mid-gut volvulus and intestinal atresia [5].&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The authors provide a rationale for the review in the context of the current knowledge about short bowel syndrome.

- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Abstract Background Laparoscopic orchidopexy (LO) has been widespread used in the management of non-palpable testis (NPT) in children. However, the real advantages of LO over traditional open orchidopexy (OO) still remain exclusive. Methods Published studies until August 31, 2010 were searched from Medline, Embase, Ovid, Web of Science, and Cochrane databases. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and observational clinical studies (OCSs) with a comparison of LO and OO were included for a systemic review and meta-analysis. Results Out of 226 studies, 2 RCTs and 5 OCSs were eligible for inclusion criteria, comprising 176 cases of LO and 263 cases of OO. The hospital stay of LO was significantly shorter than that of OO (WMD = -0.66; 95% confidence interval [CI] = -0.95 to -0.37; P \ 0.00001). However, no significant difference was observed between LO and OO in operative time (WMD = 4.02; 95% CI = -9.89 to 17.93; P = 0.57), time to resume feeding (WMD = -2.29; 95% CI = -6.78 to 2.20; P = 0.32) or full activity (WMD = -9.71; 95% CI = -27.84 to 8.42; P = 0.29), recurrence (OR = 0.60; 95% CI = 0.13 to 2.72; P = 0.51), viable testis rate (OR = 1.61; 95% CI = 0.30 to 8.52; P = 0.58), success rate (OR = 1.41; 95% CI = 0.44 to 4.46; P = 0.56), and testicular atrophy (OR = 1.70; 95% CI = 0.49 to 5.98; P = 0.40). Conclusion Although shorter hospital stay is noted in LO, it does not provide significant advantage over open surgery for treating NPT. However, due to the publishing bias, a series of RCTs are necessary to explore the efficiencies of LO in the management of NPT in children.&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The abstract provides a structured summary of the review.
- Response: [Yes]

P3. Introduction / Rationale: Describe the rationale for the review in the context of what is already known.
- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The undescended testes (cryptorchidism) is one of the most common disorders of childhood, affecting 0.8–1.8% of infants at 1 year of age, 3% of full-term newborns, and 21% of premature babies [1, 2]. Approximate 20% of these cases represent non-palpable testes (NPT) that can be abdominal (normal or dysgenetic and high or low), intracanalicular, ectopic, or absent (true monorchia or vanishing testis) [1]. It has been established that abdominal testes may be associated with an increased risk of infertility and cancer [3, 4]. The incidence of carcinoma in situ is determined to be 1.7% among patients with undescended testes, especially among those 18–20 years of age [4]. Thus, early diagnosis and treatment of undescended testis are needed to preserve fertility and to prevent testicular malignancy.&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The authors provide a rationale for the review in the context of what is already known.
- Response: [Yes]

Two hundred and twenty-six studies were initially found to report the laparoscopy in the management of NPT using the keywords ‘‘laparoscopy’’ and ‘‘non-palpable testis’’. Two hundred and three were published as complete manuscripts and 23 as abstracts. After screening all titles and abstracts, 129 studies were excluded due to review article or reports in adult. The number of studies was reduced to 97 by limiting the laparoscopic management of NPT in children with the keywords ‘‘laparoscopy’’, ‘‘nonpalpable testis’’, and ‘‘children’’. Seventy-nine articles were further excluded due to no comparison with open surgery. After independent review, 18 publications dealing with comparison of LO and OO for the treatment of pediatric NPT were considered to be eligible for inclusion in the analysis. Eleven of these studies were subsequently excluded for only comparing the diagnosis of NPT, leaving 2 RCTs and 5 observational clinical studies (OCSs) for systematic review [5, 9–14] (Fig. 1).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;Two hundred and twenty-six studies were initially found to report the laparoscopy in the management of NPT using the keywords ‘‘laparoscopy’’ and ‘‘non-palpable testis’’.

- Reasoning: The authors present the results of individual studies for all outcomes considered.
- Response: [Yes]

P21. Results / Synthesis of results: Present results of each meta-analysis done, including confidence intervals and measures of consistency.
- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Statistical analyses were performed using the Review Manager 4.2.10 Software (The Cochrane Collaboration, Oxford, UK). Statistical heterogeneity was assessed using the I2 statistics.&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The authors present the results of the meta-analysis, including confidence intervals and measures of consistency.
- Response: [Yes]

P22. Results / Risk of bias across studies: Present results of any assessment of risk of bias across studies (see Item P15).
- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;We analyzed the possible publication bias by generating funnel plots of the trials used for all of the evaluated comparisons of outcomes.&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The authors present the results of the assessment of risk of bias across studies.
- Response: [Yes]

P23. Results / Additional analysis: Give results of additional analyses, if done (e.g., sensitivity or subgroup analyses, meta-regression [see Item P16]).
- Quote: Not available.
- Reasoning: The authors do not mention any additional analyses.
- Response: [No]

P24. Discussion / Summary of evidence: Summarize the main findings including the strength of evidence for each main outcome; consider their relevance to key groups (e.g., healthcare providers, users, and policy makers).
- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;In this meta-analysis, we demonstrate that the operative time, time to resume feeding and full activity is similar between LO and OO. Although the hospital stay of LO was slightly shorter than that of OO, this benefit may be less significant due to the one day basis of both procedures in most centers.&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The authors summarize the main findings and consider their relevance to key groups.
- Response: [Yes]

P25. Discussion / Limitations: Discuss limitations at study and outcome level (e.g., risk of bias), and at review-level (e.g., incomplete retrieval of identified research, reporting bias).
- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;However, due to the publishing bias, a series of RCTs are necessary to explore the efficiencies of LO in the management of NPT in children.&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The authors discuss the limitations of the review.
- Response: [Yes]

P26. Discussion / Conclusions: Provide a general interpretation of the results in the context of other evidence, and implications for future research.
- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;In this meta-analysis, we demonstrate that the operative time, time to resume feeding and full activity is similar between LO and OO. Although the hospital stay of LO was slightly shorter than that of OO, this benefit may be less significant due to the one day basis of both procedures in most centers. In addition, the recurrence, success rate and testicular atrophy were found to be comparable between LO and LO, suggesting that laparoscopy does not provide significant advantage over open surgery for treating NPT. However, due to the publishing bias, a series of RCTs are still necessary to explore the efficiencies of LO in the management of NPT in children, especially in the true outcome of orchidopexy and fertility in adulthood.&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The authors provide a general interpretation of the results and implications for future research.
- Response: [Yes]

P27. Funding: Describe sources of funding for the systematic review and other support (e.g., supply of data); role of funders for the systematic review.

Background/purpose: Interval appendicectomy (IA) is commonly performed after successful nonoperative treatment of appendix mass (AM); although, this approach has recently been challenged. We systematically reviewed the pediatric literature with regard to the justification for this practice. Methods: Using a defined search strategy, studies were identified and data were extracted independently by 2 reviewers. Incidences of recurrent appendicitis, complications after IA, and carcinoid tumor were estimated accounting for interstudy heterogeneity. Cost and length of stay of IA were analyzed. Results: Three studies (127 cases) reporting routine nonsurgical treatment were identified; all were retrospective. There was marked interstudy heterogeneity and variable follow-up. After successful nonoperative treatment of AM, the risk of recurrent appendicitis is 20.5% (95% confidence interval [CI], 14.3%-28.4%). The incidence of complications after IA (23 studies, n = 1247) is 3.4% (95% CI, 2.25.1), and the incidence of carcinoid tumor found at IA (15 studies, n = 955) is 0.9% (95% CI, 0.5-1.8). No reports compared costs. Mean length of stay for IA was 3 days (range, 1-30 days). Conclusions: Prospective studies comparing routine IA with nonoperative treatment without IA in children are lacking. Available data suggest that 80% of children with AM may not need IA. A prospective study to evaluate the natural history of this condition compared with the morbidity and costs of IA is warranted.' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;Background/purpose: Interval appendicectomy (IA) is commonly performed after successful nonoperative treatment of appendix mass (AM); although, this approach has recently been challenged.

- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;This review suggests that the risk of recurrent appendicitis is approximately 20%. Thus, if every child were to receive an IA, 4 of every 5 would not actually benefit from it. Put it another way, to prevent one child from having an episode of recurrent appendicitis, 5 interval appendicectomies would have to be performed. Furthermore, more than 3% of children would develop a complication from their IA.&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The authors summarized the main findings and discussed their relevance to healthcare providers.
- Answer: [Yes]

P25. Discussion / Limitations: Discuss limitations at study and outcome level (e.g., risk of bias), and at review-level (e.g., incomplete retrieval of identified research, reporting bias).
- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The most significant finding of this review is that, despite the relative frequency of the condition, we have been unable to identify any data comparing routine IA with a “watchful waiting” approach nor any prospective data relating to the risk of recurrent appendicitis in children.&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The authors discussed the limitations of the review, including the lack of comparative and prospective data.
- Answer: [Yes]

P26. Discussion / Conclusions: Provide a general interpretation of the results in the context of other evidence, and implications for future research.
- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;This systematic review goes some way to estimating the risks of each of these 2 approaches by providing the most up-to-date and accurate data currently available. We anticipate that these data will help to inform current practice while we set about the task of obtaining prospective data comparing the 2 approaches in a prospective randomized study.&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The authors provided a general interpretation of the results and discussed the implications for future research.
- Answer: [Yes]

P27. Funding: Describe sources of funding for the systematic review and other support (e.g., supply of data); role of funders for the systematic review.

Abstract Incidental appendectomy is the removal of the vermiform appendix accompanying another operation, without evidence of acute appendicitis. It is generally performed to eliminate the risk of future appendicitis. The risks and benefits of incidental appendectomy during various operations in children have been debated for over a century, but need to be revisited in light of innovations in medical practice, including minimally invasive surgery, improved imaging techniques, and use of the appendix as a tubular conduit for reconstruction. A detailed review was undertaken of the techniques, pathology, risks of appendectomy, utility of the appendix, and incidental appendectomy in the treatment of specific pediatric medical conditions. A comprehensive literature search was performed, and retrieved results were reviewed for relevance to the topic. The decision to perform a pediatric incidental appendectomy relies on informed consideration of the individual patient’s co-morbid conditions, the indication for the initial operation, the future utility of the appendix, and the risk of future appendiceal pathology.' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;Abstract: Incidental appendectomy is the removal of the vermiform appendix accompanying another operation, without evidence of acute appendicitis.

P3. Introduction / Rationale: Describe the rationale for the review in the context of what is already known.
Quotes: <span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 99.9%):

Rationale Incidental appendectomy (IA) is defined as the removal of the vermiform appendix accompanying another operation, without evidence of acute appendicitis. Advocates for IA cite ease of resection, low morbidity, no additional anesthetic risks, high incidence of disease in specimens, and elimination of confusion over future conflicting diagnosis [1]. Opponents argue that transecting an organ containing colonic flora in an otherwise clean procedure violates sound surgical principles and increases operative time and morbidity. Prior to IA, a surgeon must consider the incidence of appendicitis and other appendiceal diseases, associated procedural morbidity, potential functions of the appendix, co-morbidities, and pathologic findings in incidentally removed appendices [2].' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;Rationale: Incidental appendectomy (IA) is defined as the removal of the vermiform appendix accompanying another operation, without evidence of acute appendicitis.

Abstract Purpose: Minimally invasive adrenalectomy (MIA) is the criterion standard for removal of small adrenal tumors in adults. The purpose of this review was to determine the place of MIA in children. Methods: The authors conducted a systematic review of the pediatric and adult literature about MIA, focusing on the technique and indications. Results: Minimally invasive adrenalectomy appears superior to open adrenalectomy for small tumors. The potential advantages of MIA are appealing for postoperative pain, risk of intestinal obstruction, and quality of scars. The most common approach is the transperitoneal lateral laparoscopy, which allows for a large working space. For small tumors or for bilateral adrenalectomy, the prone retroperitoneoscopy is a promising new technique. In children, the learning curve is an issue because the indications are rare. The most common indication is neuroblastoma without image-defined surgical risk factors. The incidence of local recurrence is low, but the follow-up is short in most cases. Conclusions: Minimally invasive adrenalectomy is promising for removal of small adrenal tumors. Long-term follow-up is required to evaluate the efficacy of MIA in neuroblastomas. Benign diseases are excellent candidates for this minimally invasive technique.' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;Abstract: Purpose: Minimally invasive adrenalectomy (MIA) is the criterion standard for removal of small adrenal tumors in adults.

Abstract: Purpose: To further explore the feasibility and safety of laparoscopic pyeloplasty (LP) in children with ureteropelvic junction obstruction compared with open pyeloplasty (OP). Methods: PUBMED, Web of science and Cochrane library were searched until Oct. 2014 to find eligible studies. WMD, OR, RD and their 95% CIs were used to estimate the difference. Baseline such as age, gender and crossing vessel, perioperative outcomes such as length of stay, operative time, overall complications, and success rate were compared. All the meta-analyses were performed in Revman 5.2. Results: 15 comparative studies and one RCT were eligible and included in the metaanalysis. Compared with OP, LP groups might be associated with shorted length of hospital stay (WMD: -1.92, 95% CI: -2.45--1.39), reduced complications (OR: 0.71, 95% CI: 0.49-1.01) and equal success rate (RD: 0.01, 95% CI: -0.02-0.04), but prolonged operative time (WMD: 48.64, 95% CI: 31.16-66.12). Conclusion: Our findings supported that laparoscopic pyeloplasty is feasibility and safety in the treatment of UPJ obstruction in children, especially in high-volume centers with experienced experts.

Abstract ▼ Objective: Aim of the study was to compare the outcomes after laparoscopic pyloromyotomy (LP) with those of open pyloromyotomy (OP) for infantile pyloric stenosis. Method: We conducted searches until February 2009 in multiple databases and identifi ed randomized controlled trials comparing LP with OP for pyloric stenosis. Results were expressed using the odds ratio (OR) for categorical variables and standard weighted mean differences (SMD) for continuous outcomes. Study quality was assessed using the Cochrane Handbook 5.0.1 guidelines and statistical analysis was performed using RevMan 5.0.8 software. Results: 3 studies totaling 492 infants were included. The results showed no signifi cant differences in complications between the groups with regard to wound infection (OR: 1.77, 95 % CI 0.58–5.35), mucosal perforations (OR: 0.96, 95 % CI: 0.22 – 4.26), incisional hernia or granuloma (OR: 1.39, 95 % CI: 0.41–4.73), incomplete pyloromyotomy (OR: 0.13, 95 % CI: 0.02– 1.07), substantial vomiting (OR: 0.67, 95 % CI: 0.30– 1.52) and total complications (OR: 0.91, 95 % CI: 0.54 – 1.53). Although the combined result of 2 studies also indicated an insignifi cant discrepancy in timerelated outcomes for full time to feeds, length of stay after surgery and operating time (SMD: 0.78, 95 % CI: − 0.50–2.06; SMD: 1.27, 95 % CI: − 1.56 – 4.10; SMD: − 0.46, 95 % CI: − 1.11 – 0.20, respectively), another study indicated shorter times for LP procedures (p = 0.002, 0.027, and 0.008, respectively). Conclusions: Only a few trials were available for analysis. Heterogeneity was seen between studies, but the available trials were of high quality. The present study shows that both OP and LP are equally safe and effective procedures for the management of pyloric stenosis in children. However, there was a trend in LP toward shorter time time-related outcomes.' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;Abstract: Objective: Aim of the study was to compare the outcomes after laparoscopic pyloromyotomy (LP) with those of open pyloromyotomy (OP) for infantile pyloric stenosis.

Quotes: <span title='Moderate quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 76.9%):

Pyloric stenosis, also known as infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis (IHPS), results in a functional gastric outlet obstruction because of hypertrophy and hyperplasia of the muscular layers in the pylorus. It is the most common cause of vomiting requiring surgical intervention in infants [1, 2] , affecting up to approximately 1– 4 per 1 000 live births [3, 4] . Pyloromyotomy is an effective surgical intervention with rare mortality and has traditionally been performed via an open technique since the early 20 th century.

Quotes: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Heterogeneity among studies was estimated by the use of the I2 statistic, typically, values above 50 % are deemed to suggest large heterogeneity, values of 25– 50 % are deemed to show modest heterogeneity, and values below 25 % are deemed to represent low heterogeneity. We used a fixed effect model throughout the review as the measure of inconsistency was low for all comparisons, otherwise, a random effect model or standard effect model was used for the measure of high inconsistency.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: The authors present the results of the meta-analysis.
Response: [Yes]

P22. Results / Risk of bias across studies: Present results of any assessment of risk of bias across studies (see Item P15).
Quotes: No relevant quotes found.
Reasoning: The authors do not present results of any assessment of risk of bias across studies.
Response: [No]

P23. Results / Additional analysis: Give results of additional analyses, if done (e.g., sensitivity or subgroup analyses, meta-regression [see Item P16]).
Quotes: No relevant quotes found.
Reasoning: The authors do not mention any additional analyses.
Response: [No]

P24. Discussion / Summary of evidence: Summarize the main findings including the strength of evidence for each main outcome; consider their relevance to key groups (e.g., healthcare providers, users, and policy makers).
Quotes: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Overall, this systematic review has shown a similar frequency of complications for LP and OP procedures. Furthermore, it also showed a trend toward shorter times for LP. Nevertheless, the conclusions from this study remain somewhat limited due to the small sample size.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: The authors summarize the main findings and consider their relevance.
Response: [Yes]

P25. Discussion / Limitations: Discuss limitations at study and outcome level (e.g., risk of bias), and at review-level (e.g., incomplete retrieval of identified research, reporting bias).
Quotes: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;As with any systematic review, the limitations of this study reflect those of the individual studies. Most relied on information from databases. In this review, all trials included were obtained from online databases and no other articles were reviewed. Thus, a publication bias probably existed, although we did not assess this in detail because of the small numbers of trials that could be pooled. The heterogeneity of some variables in this study is also worthy of comment. 3 variables (full time to feed, length of stay after surgery, operating time) exhibited significant heterogeneity, as indicated by the I2 values which were all above 50 % . Possible explanations include the following factors [8] . First, the studies were all from different centers. Second, the procedures were performed by a number of different surgeons with different levels of skill and proficiency. Third, different centers may be at different points on the learning curve for LP. Moreover, the reintroduction of feeds postoperatively was based on protocols that differed among centers, and differences in feeding protocols are likely to strongly influence the time to full feeds and therefore increase the heterogeneity. The effect of different postoperative feeding protocols between treatment groups in individual studies on the time taken to achieve full feeds and the postoperative length of stay may be significant. An additional weakness was the fact that the number of RCTs and patients included is small, which has limited the ability to compare the relative efficacy of the treatments.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: The authors discuss the limitations of the study.
Response: [Yes]

P26. Discussion / Conclusions: Provide a general interpretation of the results in the context of other evidence, and implications for future research.
Quotes: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;These findings should encourage the development of future studies to assess the effect of the surgical approach on outcome measures such as postoperative pain, effect on growth and development, financial costs and the experience of the surgeons performing the technique in clinical practice.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: The authors provide a general interpretation of the results and implications for future research.
Response: [Yes]

P27. Funding: Describe sources of funding for the systematic review and other support (e.g., supply of data); role of funders for the systematic review.
Quotes: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;No sponsors were involved in study design; in the collection, analysis and interpretation of data; in the writing of the report and in the decision to submit the report for publication. All authors had access to the raw data.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: The authors describe the sources of funding for the systematic review.

<AMSTAR>
A1. Was an 'a priori' design provided?
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Our objective was to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of all published literature comparing the postoperative outcomes associated with elective surgery (while asymptomatic) versus those following surgery as part of expectant management (i.e., performing surgery only upon the development of symptoms) in children born with asymptomatic CPAM lesions.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: The authors clearly state their research question and inclusion criteria.
Response: [Yes]

A2. Was there duplicate study selection and data extraction?
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Two independent reviewers conducted all article screening; where consensus on an article could not be reached, a third reviewer was consulted.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: The authors describe a process of independent study selection and data extraction.
Response: [Yes]

A3. Was a comprehensive literature search performed?
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;To identify all studies on elective surgery and expectant management of asymptomatic CPAM lesions, we conducted an electronic literature search of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (1966 onwards), EMBASE (1980 onwards), CINAHL (1982 onwards), and PubMed (1966 onwards) in January 2015.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: The authors describe a comprehensive literature search across multiple databases.
Response: [Yes]

A4. Was the status of publication (i.e. grey literature) used as an inclusion criterion?
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;We also excluded editorials, case reviews, any studies that did not evaluate postoperative outcomes, and any studies where it was not possible to extract data only on patients who were asymptomatic at birth.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: The authors do not mention searching for grey literature or including it as part of their inclusion criteria.
Response: [No]

A5. Was a list of studies (included and excluded) provided?
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Our electronic search yielded 342 studies. After applying our exclusion criteria to titles and abstracts, 63 studies remained. Full-text review resulted in eight of these studies being included, while an additional one was identified from hand-searching the reference sections of included articles; nine studies were ultimately included.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: The authors provide a list of included studies but do not provide a list of excluded studies.
Response: [No]

A6. Were the characteristics of the included studies provided?
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;We did not identify any RCTs; all but one of the included nine studies were retrospective.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: The authors provide some information about the characteristics of the included studies, but not in a detailed or aggregated form.
Response: [No]

A7. Was the scientific quality of the included studies assessed and documented?
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;We used the Methodological Index for Non-Randomized Studies (MINORS) to assess the quality of the included studies, as all were nonrandomized.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: The authors describe using a quality assessment tool to evaluate the included studies.
Response: [Yes]

A8. Was the scientific quality of the included studies used appropriately in formulating conclusions?
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Our results should be interpreted with caution owing to the nature of the included studies (in that all but one were retrospective).&quot;</span>
Reasoning: The authors acknowledge the limitations of their included studies in their conclusions.
Response: [Yes]

A9. Were the methods used to combine the findings of studies appropriate?
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;We conducted our meta-analyses using Review Manager 5.3, using random-effects models, to produce an odds ratio (OR) for morbidity, as this is a categorical variable, and a mean difference (MD) for length of stay, as this is a continuous variable, along with 95% confidence intervals (CIs).&quot;</span>
Reasoning: The authors describe the methods used to combine the findings of the studies.
Response: [Yes]

A10. Was the likelihood of publication bias assessed?
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Finally, it is likely that some degree of reporting bias exists, however this is difficult to assess, especially with a small number of included studies.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: The authors acknowledge the possibility of publication bias but do not provide a formal assessment.
Response: [No]

A11. Was the conflict of interest included?
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The University of Ottawa Summer Studentship program provided financial support for this project.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: The authors disclose the source of funding for the systematic review.
Response: [Yes]

Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;We conducted our meta-analyses using Review Manager 5.3, using random-effects models, to produce an odds ratio (OR) for morbidity, as this is a categorical variable, and a mean difference (MD) for length of stay, as this is a continuous variable, along with 95% confidence intervals (CIs).&quot;</span>
Reasoning: The authors describe the methods used to handle data and combine the results of the studies.
Response: [Yes]

P15. Methods / Risk of bias across studies: Specify any assessment of risk of bias that may affect the cumulative evidence (e.g., publication bias, selective reporting within studies).
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Finally, it is likely that some degree of reporting bias exists, however this is difficult to assess, especially with a small number of included studies.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: The authors acknowledge the possibility of reporting bias but do not provide a formal assessment.
Response: [No]

P16. Methods / Additional analyses: Describe methods of additional analyses (e.g., sensitivity or subgroup analyses, meta-regression), if done, indicating which were pre-specified.
Quote: Not available.
Reasoning: The authors do not mention any additional analyses.
Response: [NA]

P17. Results / Study selection: Give numbers of studies screened, assessed for eligibility, and included in the review, with reasons for exclusions at each stage, ideally with a flow diagram.
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Our electronic search yielded 342 studies. After applying our exclusion criteria to titles and abstracts, 63 studies remained. Full-text review resulted in eight of these studies being included, while an additional one was identified from hand-searching the reference sections of included articles; nine studies were ultimately included.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: The authors provide the numbers of studies screened, assessed for eligibility, and included in the review.
Response: [Yes]

P18. Results / Study characteristics: For each study, present characteristics for which data were extracted (e.g., study size, PICOS, follow-up period) and provide the citations.
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;We did not identify any RCTs; all but one of the included nine studies were retrospective.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: The authors provide some information about the characteristics of the included studies, but not in a detailed or aggregated form.
Response: [No]

P19. Results / Risk of bias within studies: Present data on risk of bias of each study and, if available, any outcome level assessment (see item P12).
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The MINORS scores for our included studies ranged from 7 to 14, with a median score of 9.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: The authors present data on the risk of bias for each included study.
Response: [Yes]

P20. Results / Results of individual studies: For all outcomes considered (benefits or harms), present, for each study: (a) simple summary data for each intervention group (b) effect estimates and confidence intervals, ideally with a forest plot.
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Just less than half of these patients (n = 70, 41.7%) underwent elective surgery with 7 (10.0 %) cases of postoperative complications. The remainder were managed expectantly (n = 98, 58.3%), with 63 eventually developing symptoms between one month and seven years of age and consequently requiring surgery (64.3%); 20 experienced postoperative complications (31.8%).&quot;</span>
Reasoning: The authors present summary data and effect estimates for each study, but do not provide confidence intervals or a forest plot.
Response: [No]

P21. Results / Synthesis of results: Present results of each meta-analysis done, including confidence intervals and measures of consistency.
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The results of this meta-analysis showed that total morbidity (number of patients who experienced postoperative complications) was significantly higher when surgery was performed after symptom development compared to resection when patients were asymptomatic (OR 4.59, 95% CI 1.40 to 15.11, P = 0.01).&quot;</span>
Reasoning: The authors present the results of the meta-analysis, including confidence intervals and measures of consistency.
Response: [Yes]

P22. Results / Risk of bias across studies: Present results of any assessment of risk of bias across studies (see Item P15).
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Finally, it is likely that some degree of reporting bias exists, however this is difficult to assess, especially with a small number of included studies.&quot;</span>

Response: [NA]

P24. Discussion / Summary of evidence: Summarize the main findings including the strength of evidence for each main outcome; consider their relevance to key groups (e.g., healthcare providers, users, and policy makers).
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Based on our results, we recommend elective resection of asymptomatic CPAM lesions, rather than expectant management. Lung resection in an asymptomatic patient is quite safe, prevents the risk of symptom development later in life, and may help prevent the development of malignancy.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: The authors summarize the main findings and their relevance.
Response: [Yes]

P25. Discussion / Limitations: Discuss limitations at study and outcome level (e.g., risk of bias), and at review-level (e.g., incomplete retrieval of identified research, reporting bias).
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Our results should be interpreted with caution owing to the nature of the included studies (in that all but one were retrospective).&quot;</span>
Reasoning: The authors discuss the limitations of the study.
Response: [Yes]

P26. Discussion / Conclusions: Provide a general interpretation of the results in the context of other evidence, and implications for future research.

- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Despite the low risk of volvulus in the data presented here, there are anecdotal cases of patients with HS who presented with volvulus that resulted in death. At this time, it remains difficult to definitively ascertain whether the risk of death from prophylactic Ladd in HS or the risk of death owing to volvulus in patients with HS who are observed is greater. A randomized, prospective trial to determine which subsets of patients with HS have the highest risk of volvulus is needed in order to optimize the care of this patient population.&quot;</span>

Quotes: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The aim of the study was to review evidence-based data regarding the use of antibiotics for the treatment of appendicitis in children.&quot;</span> <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Studies were selected based on relevance for the following questions: (1) What perioperative antibiotics should be used for pediatric patients with nonperforated appendicitis? (2) For patients with perforated appendicitis treated with appendectomy: a. What perioperative intravenous antibiotics should be used? b. How long should perioperative intravenous antibiotics be used? c. Should oral antibiotics be used? (3) For patients with perforated appendicitis treated with initial nonoperative management, what antibiotics should be used in the initial management?&quot;</span>
Reasoning: The authors clearly state the research question and inclusion criteria.
Response: [Yes]

A2. Was there duplicate study selection and data extraction?
Quotes: None.
Reasoning: The text does not provide information on whether there was duplicate study selection and data extraction.
Response: [No]

A3. Was a comprehensive literature search performed?
Quotes: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Data were obtained from PubMed, MEDLINE, and citation review.&quot;</span> <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;PubMed and other databases of the English literature (up to August 2009) were analyzed. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects, and the HTA Database were used as well.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: The authors used multiple databases for their literature search.

Abstract Objective: The aim of the study was to review evidence-based data regarding the use of antibiotics for the treatment of appendicitis in children. Data Source: Data were obtained from PubMed, MEDLINE, and citation review. Study Selection: We conducted a literature search using “appendicitis” combined with “antibiotics” with children as the target patient population. Studies were selected based on relevance for the following questions: (1) What perioperative antibiotics should be used for pediatric patients with nonperforated appendicitis? (2) For patients with perforated appendicitis treated with appendectomy: a. What perioperative intravenous antibiotics should be used? b. How long should perioperative intravenous antibiotics be used? c. Should oral antibiotics be used? (3) For patients with perforated appendicitis treated with initial nonoperative management, what antibiotics should be used in the initial management? Results: Children with nonperforated appendicitis should receive preoperative, broad-spectrum antibiotics. In children with perforated appendicitis who had undergone appendectomy, intravenous antibiotic duration should be based on clinical criteria. Furthermore, broad-spectrum, single, or double agent therapy is as equally efficacious as but is more cost-effective than triple agent therapy.

P3. Introduction / Rationale: Describe the rationale for the review in the context of what is already known.
Quotes: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Appendicitis is the most common surgical emergency in the pediatric population. Despite the widespread prevalence of the disease, there is little consensus regarding the diagnosis and management of appendicitis. In 2000, a survey of all members of the American Pediatric Surgical Association demonstrated controversy in virtually every aspect of the management of appendicitis [1]. With respect to antibiotic therapy, there was considerable variability in the choice, duration, and route of administration of antibiotics for both acute and perforated appendicitis. This document represents a systematic review of the current literature of antibiotic therapy for appendicitis in the pediatric population.&quot;</span>

Summary of recommendations 1. In patients with nonperforated appendicitis, there is strong evidence that children should receive preoperative broadspectrum antibiotics (Grade A). 2. Broad-spectrum, single, or double agent therapy is as effective as and more cost-effective than triple agent therapy for the treatment of perforated appendicitis (Grade B). 3. The length of administration of IV antibiotics for children with perforated appendicitis should be based on clinical criteria, such as fever, pain, return of bowel function, and WBC count (Grade B). 4. In children with perforated appendicitis, a 5-day course of IV antibiotics is recommended. IV antibiotics are given initially, but completing the antibiotic course with oral antibiotics (total 7 days IV + oral) had similar results compared to a minimum 5-day course of IV antibiotics (Grade B). 5. The duration of administration of broad-spectrum IV antibiotics for nonoperative management of perforated appendicitis should be based on clinical criteria (Grade D).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;Summary of recommendations: 1.

- Reasoning: The title identifies the report as a systematic review and meta-analysis.
- Answer: [Yes]

P2. Abstract / Structured summary: Provide a structured summary including, as applicable: background; objectives; data sources; study eligibility criteria, participants, and interventions; study appraisal and synthesis methods; results; limitations; conclusions and implications of key findings; systematic review registration number.
- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Objective: The aim of this study was to explore the true efficacy and potential advantages of lymphatic sparing laparoscopic varicocelectomy (LSV) over lymphatic non-sparing laparoscopic varicocelectomy (LNSV) in children and adolescents. Methods: A search was made for studies published up until 31 August 2010 using the terms “lymphatic sparing varicocelectomy”, “laparoscopy”, “adolescent” and “children” in the Medline, Embase, Ovid, Web of Science, and Cochrane databases. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and observational clinical studies (OCSs) comparing LSV and LNSV were included. A systematic review and meta-analysis was performed using odds ratios (ORs) for dichotomous variables. Results: Out of 127 studies, 2 RCTs and 4 OCSs were eligible for inclusion, comprising 489 cases of LSV and 307 cases of LNSV. The hydrocele rates after LSV were significantly lower than after LNSV (OR = 0.19; 95 % confidence interval [CI] = 0.10 to 0.36; p < 0.00001). However, no significant difference was observed between LSV and LNSV with regard to recurrence (OR = 0.65; 95 % CI = 0.32 – 1.33; p = 0.24) or catch-up growth (OR = 2.14; 95 % CI = 0.97–4.72; p = 0.06). Conclusion: LSV is valuable in reducing the incidence of postoperative hydrocele, with similar recurrence and catch-up growth rates as LNSV. A series of RCTs are warranted to explore the efficacy of LSV in the management of varicocele in children and adolescents.&quot;</span>

- Reasoning: The title identifies the report as a systematic review and meta-analysis.
- Answer: [Yes]

P2. Abstract / Structured summary: Provide a structured summary including, as applicable: background; objectives; data sources; study eligibility criteria, participants, and interventions; study appraisal and synthesis methods; results; limitations; conclusions and implications of key findings; systematic review registration number.
- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Background: Children with neurologic impairment often fail medical management of gastroesophageal reflux and proceed to fundoplication and gastrostomy (FG) or percutaneous gastrojejunostomy (GJ). Current guidelines do not recommend one treatment over the other, and there is ongoing uncertainty regarding clinical management. Methods: We conducted a structured search of Medline, Embase, trial registries, and the gray literature. We included studies that compared outcomes for FG and GJ in children with neurologic impairment. Results: We identified 556 children from three retrospective studies who underwent FG (n = 431) or GJ (n = 125). There were no differences in rates of pneumonia (17% vs 19%, p = 0.74) or mortality (13% vs 14%, p = 0.76). Few deaths were due to procedural complications (1%) or reflux (2%). There was a trend towards more major complications with FG (29%) compared to GJ (12%) (risk ratio = 1.70, 0.85–3.41, p = 0.14). Minor complications were more common with GJ (70%) than FG (45%), but this difference was also not statistically significant (risk ratio = 0.38, 0.05–3.07, p = 0.36). No studies reported quality of life using validated measures. Conclusions: The quality of the evidence for outcomes of FG versus GJ is very low. Large comparative studies are needed to determine which approach is associated with the best quality-of-life outcomes.&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The abstract provides a structured summary of the review.
- Answer: [Yes]

P3. Introduction / Rationale: Describe the rationale for the review in the context of what is already known.
- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Children with neurologic impairment often fail medical management of gastroesophageal reflux [1–4]. Even with maximal therapy, many patients continue to experience symptoms and complications.&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The authors provide a rationale for the review in the context of existing knowledge.
- Answer: [Yes]

P4. Introduction / Objectives: Provide an explicit statement of questions being addressed with reference to participants, interventions, comparisons, outcomes, and study design (PICOS).
- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;In light of these uncertainties, we conducted a systematic review to determine if FG and GJ are equally effective for the treatment of gastroesophageal reflux refractory to maximal medical management in children with neurologic impairment.&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The authors provide an explicit statement of the research question.

Abstract Purpose: To comprehensively review the available evidences in the literature on the use of laparoscopic pyeloplasty (LP) vs open pyeloplasty (OP) for the repair of ureteropelvic junction (UPJ) obstruction in children. Materials and Methods: Published studies until the end of October 2010 were searched from Medline, Embase, Web of Science, Ovid, and Cochrane databases. The literature search, quality assessment, and data extraction were independently performed by two reviewers. A systematic review and meta-analysis were performed by using Review Manager 4.2.8 software. Results: Of 1403 studies, one randomized controlled trial (RCT), two prospective comparative studies, and six retrospective observational studies were eligible for inclusion criteria, comprising 694 cases of LP and 7334 cases of OP. The OP has significantly reduced operative time (weighted mean difference [WMD] = 59.00; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 41.15 to 76.85; P < 0.00001) and higher stent placement rate (odds ratio [OR] = 5.97; 95% CI = 3.17 to 11.26; P < 0.00001) compared with LP, whereas the duration of hospital stay was shorter in the LP group (WMD = - 0.40; 95% CI = - 0.77 to - 0.03; P = 0.03). No difference was observed between LP and OP regarding complications (OR = 0.78; 95% CI = 0.46 to 1.34; P = 0.37) or success rate (OR = 1.76; 95% CI = 0.71 to 4.36; P = 0.22). Conclusions: LP is a minimally invasive, safe, and effective therapy method for UPJ obstruction in children, with shorter hospital stay and excellent outcomes, and without additional risk of postoperative complications. Because of the publishing bias, a series of RCTs are necessary to explore the efficiencies of LP in the management of UPJ obstruction in children.' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;Abstract: Purpose: To comprehensively review the available evidences in the literature on the use of laparoscopic pyeloplasty (LP) vs open pyeloplasty (OP) for the repair of ureteropelvic junction (UPJ) obstruction in children. Materials and Methods: Published studies until the end of October 2010 were searched from Medline, Embase, Web of Science, Ovid, and Cochrane databases. The literature search, quality assessment, and data extraction were independently performed by two reviewers. A systematic review and meta-analysis were performed by using Review Manager 4.2.8 software. Results: Of 1403 studies, one randomized controlled trial (RCT), two prospective comparative studies, and six retrospective observational studies were eligible for inclusion criteria, comprising 694 cases of LP and 7334 cases of OP. The OP has significantly reduced operative time (weighted mean difference [WMD] = 59.00; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 41.15 to 76.85; P < 0.00001) and higher stent placement rate (odds ratio [OR] = 5.97; 95% CI = 3.17 to 11.26; P < 0.00001) compared with LP, whereas the duration of hospital stay was shorter in the LP group (WMD = - 0.40; 95% CI = - 0.77 to - 0.03; P = 0.03). No difference was observed between LP and OP regarding complications (OR = 0.78; 95% CI = 0.46 to 1.34; P = 0.37) or success rate (OR = 1.76; 95% CI = 0.71 to 4.36; P = 0.22). Conclusions: LP is a minimally invasive, safe, and effective therapy method for UPJ obstruction in children, with shorter hospital stay and excellent outcomes, and without additional risk of postoperative complications. Because of the publishing bias, a series of RCTs are necessary to explore the efficiencies of LP in the management of UPJ obstruction in children.&quot;</span>

Abstract Background: Excision has been established as a standard management practice for choledochal cysts in the last few decades. The two most commonly performed methods of reconstruction after excision are hepaticoduodenostomy (HD) and Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy (HJ), of which the HJ is favored by most surgeons. Evidence concerning the optimal method of reconstruction is, however, sparse. Materials and Methods: Studies comparing outcomes from HD and HJ after choledochal cyst excision were identified by searching Medline, Ovid, Search Medica, Elsevier Clinicalkey, Google Scholar and Cochrane library. Suitable studies were chosen and data extracted for meta-analysis. Outcomes evaluated included operative time, hospital stay and incidence of postoperative bile leak, cholangitis, reflux/gastritis, anastomotic stricture, bleeding, intestinal obstruction and re-operative rate. Pooled odds ratios (OR) were calculated for dichotomous variables; pooled mean differences (MD) were measured for continuous variables. Results: Six retrospective studies were included in this meta-analysis, comprising a total of 679 patients, 412 of whom (60.7%) underwent HD, and the remainder, 267(39.3%) underwent HJ. Although, HD group had slightly shorter hospital stay (MD: 0.30; 95% CI: −0.22–0.39; P b 0.00001) it showed a higher incidence of postoperative reflux/gastritis (OR: 0.08; 95% CI: − 0.02–0.39; P = 0.002). However, the other outcomes such as bile leak, cholangitis, anastomotic stricture, bleeding, operative time, reoperation rate and adhesive intestinal obstruction did not differ between HD and HJ groups. Conclusions: HD shows higher postoperative reflux/gastritis than HJ but a shorter hospital stay. There are few good-quality studies that compare the outcomes from HD and HJ, meaning that caution should be exercised in the generalization of the results of this meta-analysis, which suggests HD to be comparable with HJ in terms of other complications, operative benefits and outcomes.' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;Abstract: Background: Excision has been established as a standard management practice for choledochal cysts in the last few decades.

P3. Introduction / Rationale: Describe the rationale for the review in the context of what is already known.
Quotes: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Choledochal cysts are congenital bile duct anomalies with cystic dilatation of the biliary tree and have potential for various complications. Most of the reported cases in the world come from Asia but it is not uncommon in the western world. Complete resection of the extra hepatic bile duct is the accepted management of choledochal cyst [1]. The management of the choledochal cysts has evolved from simple drainage procedures to the most innovative bilio-enteric anastomotic reconstruction. Biliary reconstruction is now commonly performed by one of several techniques, including Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy (HJ), hepaticoduodenostomy (HD), and jejunal interposition hepaticoduodenostomy [2] and [3]. Debate continues regarding the optimal method of biliary reconstruction.&quot;</span>

Abstract Introduction: Laparoscopy, as a minimally invasive diagnostic and therapeutic tool in blunt abdominal trauma (BAT), is not commonly used and has been shown to be controversial. The aim of this study is to assess the role of laparoscopy in the diagnosis and therapy of BAT. Methods: A systematic review and a comprehensive literature search was performed at the U.S. National Library of Medicine site in Medline and PubMed from January 2000 to 31 December 2007. This article attempts to outline the efficacy, the indications, contraindications, surgical technique and therapeutic possibilities of laparoscopy in BAT. Pediatric surgery articles and those addressing penetrating abdominal wounds, nontraumatic abdominal emergencies and iatrogenic injuries were excluded from this review. Results: Sixty-six articles were reviewed, which included 22 case studies, 27 case reports, 17 reviews and 2 guidelines. The reviewed articles comprised 343 patients with BAT and laparoscopic approach. Therapeutic laparoscopy was possible in 168 cases (48,98%), 51 cases were converted (14,87%), overlooked injuries were absent, 6 patients had complications (1,75%), no mortality laparoscopy-related. The main indications for laparoscopy in BAT include the confirmation of suspected diaphragmatic defects, suspected hollow viscus and Is laparoscopy still needed in blunt abdominal trauma? A.E.

Diagnostic laparoscopy (DL) is also indicated in patients with suspected intra-abdominal injuries when advanced emergency imaging investigations are unavailable. Laparoscopy allows the surgeon to perform hemostasis, resections, suturing, autotransfusion, etc. Conclusion: Although is not widely used, laparoscopy could still be useful in selected patients with BAT who have equivocal findings on clinical exam and imaging investigations in order to clarify the lesional diagnosis, thus avoiding unnecessary laparotomies.

- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The evidence base in regard to the treatment of H-type fistula in children is poor, and as well stated by Tovar and Fragoso [31], in the absence of evidence-based strategies, ‘‘eminence-based’’ ones are legitimate.&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The authors summarize the main findings and the strength of evidence.
- Response: [Yes]

P25. Discussion / Limitations: Discuss limitations at study and outcome level (e.g., risk of bias), and at review-level (e.g., incomplete retrieval of identified research, reporting bias).
- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;This systematic review had some inherent limitations. Firstly, it included a small number of patients, and many endpoints of the study could not be compared in a statistically relevant way.&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The authors discuss the limitations of the study.
- Response: [Yes]

P26. Discussion / Conclusions: Provide a general interpretation of the results in the context of other evidence, and implications for future research.

Abstract Background/Purpose: Total esophagogastric dissociation has been described as both a primary and a rescue procedure for patients with severe gastroesophageal reflux. Although most commonly used in the neurologically impaired, it has also been used in those with no neurological impairment. The main objective of this study was to determine morbidity and mortality for this procedure. Methods: All published cases of esophagogastric dissociation in children were identified. Series were updated where possible by personal communication with the author. Patient characteristics, indications, morbidity, and mortality were analyzed. Results: One hundred eighty-one cases were identified. One hundred seventeen were primary operations and 64 were rescue procedures. There were 29 (16.0%) early complications and 28 (15.5%) late complications with 6 (3.3%) deaths related to the procedure of a total of 35 deaths. Twenty-one patients (11.6%) required re-operation in the study periods. Conclusions: Esophagogastric dissociation has an acceptable morbidity and mortality. It is useful as both a primary and a rescue procedure.' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;Abstract: Background/Purpose: Total esophagogastric dissociation has been described as both a primary and a rescue procedure for patients with severe gastroesophageal reflux.

Total esophagogastric dissociation (TOGD) is an antireflux procedure originally described as a “rescue” procedure for use in children with neurological impairment (NI) by Bianchi [1] in 1997. Its use has subsequently been broadened to include neurologically normal children and adults with NI [2]. TOGD is now used as both a primary surgical procedure and as “rescue” therapy following failed fundoplication.' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;Total esophagogastric dissociation (TOGD) is an anti-reflux procedure originally described as a “rescue” procedure for use in children with neurological impairment (NI) by Bianchi [1] in 1997.

Abstract Introduction Minimally invasive surgery (MIS) has emerged as an alternative to open approach for cancer diagnosis in children 20 years ago, but only recently for tumor resection. The purpose of this review is to update the use of MIS in pediatric oncological surgery over the past five years. Methods The authors conducted a systematic review of papers published between 2009 and 2014 focusing on indications and results of the technique. Results New indications in Wilms tumor, pheochromocytoma, and lung nodules have emerged, thanks to the growing use of MIS in benign urological and thoracic surgery with satisfactory results. Case control studies comparing MIS to open approach have been published for the first time in more classical indications such as neurogenic tumors, while robot-assisted procedure has shown concern in results about its early experience in solid tumors. Conclusion MIS is a promising method for removal of thoracic and abdominal malignancies as long as oncological principles are strictly followed. Long-term followup is mandatory to further delineate objective indications.' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;Abstract: Introduction Minimally invasive surgery (MIS) has emerged as an alternative to open approach for cancer diagnosis in children 20 years ago, but only recently for tumor resection.

Objective To determine overall complication rates of the tubularized incised plate (TIP) repair and assess the effects of technical modifications, length of followup and geographical location of reported results. Materials and methods A systematic literature search was undertaken, using Medline and Pubmed, in order to identify relevant articles. Random effects models were used to estimate pooled complication rates. Meta-regression was performed for each outcome by using mixed effects models with type of hypospadias (primary distal, primary proximal and secondary) as predictors. Results Of the 189 articles that were identified, 49 studies (4675 patients) were included in the analysis. Fistula and re-operation rates were significantly higher in secondary repairs (15.5% and 23.3%) compared to primary proximal (10.3% and 12.2%) and primary distal (5.7% and 4.5%) (P Z 0.045 and P < 0.001, respectively). Technical modifications reduced fistula rates from 10.3% to 3.3% (P Z 0.003) and reoperation rates from 13.6% to 2.8% (P Z 0.001). The rate of meatal stenosis was highest in the secondary repairs, with follow-up >1 year (12.7%). Comparison of geographical location showed that complication rates for all but one variable were significantly lower in North America when compared to Europe and the rest of the world. Mean meatal stenosis rates were 1.8% in North America, 3.4% in Europe and 8.2% in the rest of the world (P Z 0.002). This remained significant in a multivariable model incorporating repair technique and length of follow-up (P Z 0.046). Mean rates of urethral stricture, fistula and re-operation followed a similar pattern (P Z 0.045, P Z 0.009 and P < 0.001, respectively). Mean follow-up was shortest in the North American group, at 11.9 months, compared to Europe, at 17.8 months, and the rest of the world, at 18.9 months. Discussion The present meta-analysis has shown that the lowest complication rates for the TIP repair are when it is applied to primary distal hypospadias. Complication rates are higher for all variables when the TIP repair is used for primary proximal hypospadias. Lower complication rates than those reported in this TIP review have been documented in some studies using a staged repair for correction of primary proximal or secondary hypospadias [11,12,68], implying that a staged approach may be superior to the TIP repair in these settings. Documentation of follow-up duration was limited, making assessment of the impact of length of follow-up difficult. Geographical location had a noticeable effect on outcome, with all but one complication being lower in the North American than the other groups. Mean follow-up was shortest in North America and it is suggested that the short follow-up in the North American studies may have led to under-reporting of late complications. Conclusion The TIP repair has evolved to incorporate modifications that have significantly lowered complications. Higher complication rates are seen with secondary and proximal repairs; however, limited, published long-term data impair a true assessment of outcome.' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;Objective: To determine overall complication rates of the tubularized incised plate (TIP) repair and assess the effects of technical modifications, length of follow-up and geographical location of reported results.

P3. Introduction / Rationale: Describe the rationale for the review in the context of what is already known.
- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Over 300 methods of surgical repair have been described for the correction of hypospadias, with no one procedure accepted as the gold standard for each degree of hypospadias. First described in 1994 by Snodgrass [1], the tubularized incised plate (TIP) urethroplasty has become the most popular technique for distal hypospadias [2,3]. Originally described for correction of distal hypospadias, it has also been applied to more severe proximal forms. There is a wide discrepancy between published complication rates for different repair types [4e16] and a poor evidence base for the current management of hypospadias.&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The authors provide a rationale for the review in the context of the existing literature.
- Answer: [Yes]

P4. Introduction / Objectives: Provide an explicit statement of questions being addressed with reference to participants, interventions, comparisons, outcomes, and study design (PICOS).
- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Due to the popularity of the TIP repair technique, a large number of papers giving outcomes and complication rates have been published. As there is a paucity of randomised, controlled trials, a meta-analysis of the outcomes of the TIP repair was performed with a view to: 1. Assessing the appropriateness of its application to all degrees of hypospadias. 2. Evaluating the long-term results by analysing the pooled complication rates to accurately determine representative complication rates for this technique. 3. Reviewing the effects of technical modifications, length of follow-up and geographical location of these complications.&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The authors provide an explicit statement of the questions being addressed in the review.
- Answer: [Yes]

P5. Methods / Protocol and registration: Indicate if a review protocol exists, if and where it can be accessed (e.g., Web address), and, if available, provide registration information including registration number.
- Quote: No relevant information found in the text.
- Reasoning: The authors do not mention a review protocol or registration information.
- Answer: [No]

P6. Methods / Eligibility criteria: Specify study characteristics (e.g., PICOS, length of follow-up) and report characteristics (e.g., years considered, language, publication status) used as criteria for eligibility, giving rationale.
- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Of the 189 studies identified, only 49 (4675 patients) [14,17e64] fulfilled the inclusion criteria, as detailed below: 1. Paediatric populations solely 2. TIP technique used 3. Complications given for at least one of those under consideration 4. Population previously unreported 5. Article in English 6. No foreskin reconstruction 7. Results separated by meatal location and primary or secondary repair.&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The authors specify the eligibility criteria for the studies included in the review.
- Answer: [Yes]

P7. Methods / Information sources: Describe all information sources (e.g., databases with dates of coverage, contact with study authors to identify additional studies) in the search and date last searched.
- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;A systematic literature search was undertaken, using Medline and Pubmed, in order to identify relevant articles.&quot;</span>

- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The complication rates after TIP for proximal and secondary procedures are substantial, and alternative techniques such as the two-stage repair should be considered. North American publications are based on shorter follow-up and it is therefore unsurprising that reported complication rates are lower than Europe and the rest of the world. Finally, additional long-term follow-up papers are required to further evaluate this popular hypospadias technique that has now been in use for 18 years.&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The authors provide a general interpretation of the results and implications for future research.

P4. Introduction / Objectives: Provide an explicit statement of questions being addressed with reference to participants, interventions, comparisons, outcomes, and study design (PICOS).
Quotes: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The American Pediatric Surgical Association (APSA) Outcomes and Evidence Based Practice (OEBP) committee selected the following questions for this systematic review: 1. What is the optimal ventilator strategy for a newborn with CDH? 2. What is the best way to manage CDH-associated pulmonary hypertension (PHTN)? 3. Is there benefit to the use of pre- or postnatal corticosteroids? 4. Which mode of ECMO is best for CDH, and what is the optimal duration of treatment with ECMO? 5. What is the optimal technique to repair CDH (open versus minimally invasive) and which type of patch has the best outcome? 6. Is early repair or late repair of CDH better?&quot;</span>

Quotes: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The searches were performed independently for each question with the aid of a health sciences librarian who used broad Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) search terms that were inclusive and redundant, and included wildcard based searches to ensure completeness. Using bibliography management software, duplicates were removed, creating a master list of titles and abstracts. Two of the principal authors (P.P. and S.I.) independently scanned all titles as a first screen after which selected abstracts and/or full-length papers were collected for further review.&quot;</span>

Abstract Background: Prosthetic patches are widely used for congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) repair. We compared the complication rate of absorbable (Surgisis [SIS]; Cook Biotech, Inc, West Lafayette, IN) and nonabsorbable (polytetrafluoroethylene [PTFE]) materials for this purpose. Methods: This is a retrospective review of all neonates with CDH undergoing patch closure at our institution over 10 years. Meta-analysis was also performed combining our data with the published literature examining the effect of patch type on recurrence and small bowel obstruction (SBO). Results: Primary patch (13 SIS, 9 PTFE) repair was performed in 22 (26%) of 84 patients with CDH. Groups were comparable in terms of demographics, hospital stay, ventilator days, need for high frequency oscillation, age at surgery, and length of follow-up. Likewise, recurrence rate (SIS, 4 [31%]; PTFE, 3 [33%]; P, nonsignificant [NS]), incidence of postoperative SBO (SIS, 1 [7%] vs PTFE, 2 [22%]; P, NS), and mortality (SIS, 2 [15%] and PTFE, 2 [22%]; P, NS) were similar. Meta-analysis failed to find a significant difference between SIS and PTFE both for recurrence rate (odds ratio, 1.21 [0.51-2.84]; P, NS) and SBO (odds ratio, 1.47 [0.44-4.96]; P, NS). Conclusions: There was no difference in the incidence of CDH recurrence, SBO, or mortality post-CDH patch repair using either SIS or PTFE in our series. Meta-analysis failed to show any difference in recurrence and SBO rates between the 2 materials.' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;Abstract: Background: Prosthetic patches are widely used for congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) repair. We compared the complication rate of absorbable (Surgisis [SIS]; Cook Biotech, Inc, West Lafayette, IN) and nonabsorbable (polytetrafluoroethylene [PTFE]) materials for this purpose.

Abstract Purpose The transanal one-stage pull-through procedure (TERPT) has gained worldwide popularity over open and laparoscopic-assisted one-stage techniques in children with Hirschsprung’s disease (HD). It offers the advantages of avoiding laparotomy, laparoscopy, scars, abdominal contamination, and adhesions. However, enterocolitis associated with Hirschsprung’s disease (HAEC) still remains to be a potentially life-threatening complication after pullthrough operation. The reported incidence of HAEC ranges from 4.6 to 54%. This meta-analysis was designed to evaluate postoperative incidence of HAEC following TERPT procedure.' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;Abstract: Purpose The transanal one-stage pull-through procedure (TERPT) has gained worldwide popularity over open and laparoscopic-assisted one-stage techniques in children with Hirschsprung’s disease (HD).

Abstract Purpose The transanal one-stage pull-through procedure (TERPT) has gained worldwide popularity over open and laparoscopic-assisted one-stage techniques in children with Hirschsprung’s disease (HD). It offers the advantages of avoiding laparotomy, laparoscopy, scars, abdominal contamination, and adhesions. However, enterocolitis associated with Hirschsprung’s disease (HAEC) still remains to be a potentially life-threatening complication after pullthrough operation. The reported incidence of HAEC ranges from 4.6 to 54%. This meta-analysis was designed to evaluate postoperative incidence of HAEC following TERPT procedure.' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;Abstract: Purpose The transanal one-stage pull-through procedure (TERPT) has gained worldwide popularity over open and laparoscopic-assisted one-stage techniques in children with Hirschsprung’s disease (HD).

Abstract Background: Single-incision pediatric endosurgery (SIPES) is defined as minimally invasive surgery performed through a unique incision in the abdomen, chest, or retroperitoneum. Several publications exist, but no previous systematic review has been made to evaluate the real benefits of this approach in terms of feasibility and clinical outcomes. Materials and Methods: We performed an electronic search in PubMed up to March 2012 with the terms ‘‘single AND incision OR site OR port OR trocar AND children’’ including related articles and obtained 197 articles. After applying our inclusion criteria, 78 articles were reviewed. Results: We identified prospective controlled trials (n = 1), case-control studies (n = 12), case series (n = 49), and case reports (n = 16). In total, 4212 patients had been operated on by SIPES and were separated by systems: gastrointestinal (n = 2888), urologic (n = 390), gynecologic (n = 27), other abdominal (n = 874), and thoracic (n = 33) procedures. The most common procedure was SIPES appendectomy, and a unique prospective controlled trial supports its safety and effectiveness. Technically demanding surgeries such as hepatojejunostomy and colonic surgeries were described. Multichannel ports and multiple ports, standard and articulated instruments, transparietal instruments, retraction sutures, and magnets were used. Operative times, length of stay, and complications similar to standard laparoscopic surgery were described. A low conversion rate (to a reduced port, standard laparoscopy and open procedures) was also mentioned. No comparable measure for pain and cosmesis assessment was used. Conclusions: A wide experience in SIPES and feasibility has already been described with good clinical outcomes and low rate of conversion. Appendectomy is the unique procedure in which SIPES has been demonstrated to be safe and effective. It is pending the execution of prospective controlled trials for other operations to demonstrate, with objective evidence, the real benefits of this less invasive approach.' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;Abstract: Background: Single-incision pediatric endosurgery (SIPES) is defined as minimally invasive surgery performed through a unique incision in the abdomen, chest, or retroperitoneum.

Introduction S ingle-incision endosurgery (SIES) is defined as minimally invasive surgery performed through a unique incision in the abdomen, chest, or any other virtual cavity in the human body. Several designations of this technique have been used with the terms ‘‘incision,’’ ‘‘port,’’ ‘‘site,’’ ‘‘trocar,’’ or ‘‘access,’’ depending on the surgeon’s preference. In the search for less invasive procedures, ever since the development of laparoscopic surgery and with the limitations and equipment dependence of Natural Orifice Translumenal endoscopic surgery (NOTES Ò ; American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy [Oak Brook, IL] and Society of American Gastrointestinal and Endoscopic Surgeons [Los Angeles, CA]), this new approach through the umbilicus, a natural embrionary orifice, 1 was first reported in 1992 by Pelosi and Pelosi. 2 Quickly, the literature showed that SIES was a feasible and excellent cosmetic procedure pending the demonstration of its clinical and economic benefits with objective evidence.' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;Introduction: Single-incision endosurgery (SIES) is defined as minimally invasive surgery performed through a unique incision in the abdomen, chest, or any other virtual cavity in the human body.

Abstract Background Achalasia is a rare idiopathic neuromuscular disorder of the esophagus, characterized as a syndrome of impaired relaxation of the lower esophageal sphincter and decreased peristalsis of the esophageal body. Objective The primary objective is to determine the best first-line treatment for pediatric achalasia based on the consolidation of the current literature that compares outcomes after pneumatic dilatation (PD) versus surgical myotomy (Heller esophagomyotomy [HM]). Data Sources A systematic review of English articles using OVID was performed. Study Selection OVID was used to search for articles focusing on the treatment of pediatric esophageal achalasia with PD versus HM. Data Extraction Independent extraction of data was performed by N.E.S using predefined data fields. Data Synthesis Seven articles were included in the systematic review. Techniques of HM and PD varied widely. The best first-line treatment of pediatric achalasia was determined to be HM in two articles, PD in one article, and equal efficacy in one article. Three articles concluded that appropriate initial treatment was determined by the age of the child. Conclusion Adequate comparative data are lacking to determine the ideal treatment of pediatric achalasia. Appropriately designed randomized controlled trials with longterm follow-up are needed to determine ideal treatment algorithms in pediatric achalasia.' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;Abstract: Background Achalasia is a rare idiopathic neuromuscular disorder of the esophagus, characterized as a syndrome of impaired relaxation of the lower esophageal sphincter and decreased peristalsis of the esophageal body.

- Reasoning: The authors present results of the assessment of risk of bias across studies.
- Answer: [Yes]

P23. Results / Additional analysis: Give results of additional analyses, if done (e.g., sensitivity or subgroup analyses, meta-regression [see Item P16]).
- Quote: Not applicable.
- Reasoning: The authors do not mention any additional analyses.
- Answer: [No]

P24. Discussion / Summary of evidence: Summarize the main findings including the strength of evidence for each main outcome; consider their relevance to key groups (e.g., healthcare providers, users, and policy makers).
- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The optimal treatment algorithm for pediatric achalasia remains unclear as adequate comparative data between PD and HM are lacking. Both adult and pediatric literatures suggest that younger age may contribute to poor response to PD.&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The authors summarize the main findings and consider their relevance to healthcare providers.
- Answer: [Yes]

P25. Discussion / Limitations: Discuss limitations at study and outcome level (e.g., risk of bias), and at review-level (e.g., incomplete retrieval of identified research, reporting bias).
- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The most significant limitation with this systematic review is attributed to the heterogeneity of the study designs and treatment methods both within and between studies.&quot;</span>

Abstract Objective The laparoscopically-assisted anorectal pullthrough (LAARP) for recto-bladderneck and recto-prostatic anorectal malformations (RB/RP-ARMs) is believed to improve patient outcomes. We performed a systematic review of the effect of LAARP on postoperative mucosal prolapse and defecation dysfunction. Methods A comprehensive search of MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL, and grey literature was performed (2000–2014). Full-text screening, data abstraction and quality appraisal were conducted in duplicate. Included studies reported a primary diagnosis of RB/RP-ARM and compared LAARP versus open repair (OPEN). Results From 3681 retrieved articles, 7 studies enrolling 187 patients were analyzed. One was a randomized control trial, 6 were retrospective observational studies, and all were single-centre. The majority were of poor-moderate quality (MINORS scores: mean 16.42 (SD 2.225) out of 24). Mucosal prolapse was not significantly different after LAARP versus OPEN (p = 0.18). Defecation outcomes were inconsistently reported but were no different between LAARP and OPEN for either children [3 years old (p = 0.84), or all ages combined (p = 0.11). Conclusion We found no significant difference in rates of mucosal prolapse or defecation scores for LAARP compared to OPEN for children with RB/RP-ARMs. However, studies are small and of poor-moderate quality and results are heterogeneous. Comprehensive, standardized, reliable reporting is necessary to guide practice and inform postoperative guidelines.

Comprehensive, standardized, reliable reporting is necessary to guide practice and inform post-operative guidelines. Level of evidence 1c.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: The abstract provides a structured summary of the review.
Response: [Yes]

P3. Introduction / Rationale: Describe the rationale for the review in the context of what is already known.
Quotes: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Anorectal malformations (ARMs) occur in one in 5,000 newborns and comprise a wide spectrum of anomalies [1]. ARMs were previously designated ‘‘high’’ or ‘‘low’’ but are now classified according to the anatomic location of the fistula (e.g., in males, recto-prostatic or bladder neck versus perineal or recto-bulbar) [2–4]. Recto-bladderneck and recto-prostatic ARM (RB/RP-ARM) patients often experience a lifetime struggle with constipation, soiling or incontinence, in particular children with bladder neck fistulas [5]. Bowel management strategies have been developed and must be implemented at the time of repair, and maintained to improve outcomes [6].&quot;</span>
Reasoning: The authors provide a rationale for the review in the context of what is already known about the topic.
Response: [Yes]

P4. Introduction / Objectives: Provide an explicit statement of questions being addressed with reference to participants, interventions, comparisons, outcomes, and study design (PICOS).

We conducted a systematic review to assess the impact of a laparoscopic repair on rates of mucosal prolapse and defection dysfunction of male children born with RB/RPARMs (i.e., require an abdominal approach to their repair, either through laparoscopy or laparotomy). Additionally, we sought to describe differences in operative times, postoperative anal stenosis, anorectal manometry and urologic outcomes.' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;We conducted a systematic review to assess the impact of a laparoscopic repair on rates of mucosal prolapse and defecation dysfunction of male children born with RB/RP-ARMs (i.e., require an abdominal approach to their repair, either through laparoscopy or laparotomy).

Abstract Objective To compare the safety and efficacy between laparoscopic and open cyst excision with hepaticojejunostomy for children with choledochal cysts using metaanalysis. Methods Studies comparing the laparoscopic and the open choledochal cyst excision that met the inclusion criteria for data extraction were identified from electronic databases (PubMed, Embase, Science Citation Index, and the Cochrane Library) up to November 2014. The proceedings of relevant congress were also searched. The outcomes were operative time, intraoperative blood loss, time to food intake, postoperative morbidity and mortality, length of hospital stay. Outcomes were calculated as odds ratios (ORs) with 95 % confidence intervals (CIs) using RevMan 5.2. Results Seven retrospective studies were finally included, involving a total of 1016 patients, of whom, 408 cases underwent laparoscopic cyst excision and Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy (LH) and 608 cases underwent open cyst excision and Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy (OH). In LH group compared with OH group, the operative time was longer (MD = 59.11, 95 % CI 27.61–90.61, P = 0.0002), while the length of postoperative hospital stay was less (MD = -2.01, 95 % CI -2.49 to -1.54, P \ 0.00001), the intraoperative blood loss was lower (MD = -37.14, 95 % CI -66.69 to -7.60, P = 0.01) and time to food intake was less (MD = -1.14, 95 % CI -1.61 to -0.67, P = 0.01). The rate of postoperative morbidity was more in the OH group, but there is no statistically significant difference between the two groups in postoperative morbidity (OR = 0.52, 95 % CI 0.13–2.06, P = 0.35). Conclusion Laparoscopic surgery is a feasible, safe treatment of choledochal cyst with less postoperative morbidity, a shorter length of stay and a lower blood loss when compared with open approach. With the improvement of laparoscopic techniques and deftness of surgeons practice, laparoscopic surgery may become the first choice procedure for choledochal cyst.' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;Abstract: Objective To compare the safety and efficacy between laparoscopic and open cyst excision with hepaticojejunostomy for children with choledochal cysts using meta-analysis.

P3. Introduction / Rationale: Describe the rationale for the review in the context of what is already known.
- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Choledochal cysts are rare congenital cystic dilations of the biliary tree that present primarily in female infants and young children and are more prevalent in East Asian populations [1, 2]. The exact etiology of choledochal cysts is unknown, but anomalous pancreaticobiliary duct union (APBDU) is seen in 30–70 % of all choledochal cysts where the common bile duct (CBD) and pancreatic duct junction occurs outside the duodenum, allowing reflux of pancreatic fluid into the biliary tree [3]. Besides the classic triad of abdominal pain, right upper quadrant mass and obstructive jaundice, choledochal cysts can be associated with serious complications such as cholangitis, pancreatitis, cholelithiasis and have a high risk in developing cholangiocarcinoma [4]. Thus, total cyst excision followed by Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy reconstruction is recommended for most patients with choledochal cysts whenever possible [5]. Laparoscopic excision of choledochal cysts has increasingly gained acceptance and applicability since its first description by Farello [6]. The potential advantages of LH include shorter recovery time and improved cosmesis. However, its safety remains a major concern compared with the conventional open surgery. Therefore, we conducted this meta-analysis to compare the clinical safety and effectiveness of LH with OH.&quot;</span>

Abstract Background: Intestinal intussusception is a frequent cause of bowel obstruction in children. Initial treatment involves pneumatic reduction. If this fails, operative reduction is indicated. There is controversy regarding use of the laparoscopic (LAP) versus the conventional open approach. Patients and Methods: We performed a retrospective review of all children with intussusception who required operative reduction at our institution over a 12-year time period. We also performed a meta-analysis to combine our data with the published literature. Results: We identified 28 patients requiring operative intervention for reduction of intussusception between January 2000 and April 2012. Five patients underwent LAP reduction, and 23 patients underwent open reduction. Operative times were not statistically different. The rate of overall complications was not statistically different, with 1 of 5 (20%) and 7 of 23 (30%) having complications in the LAP and open groups, respectively. Mean length of stay was 3.8 – 2.1 days in both the LAP and open groups, with no significant difference. Our meta-analysis identified five retrospective studies comparing LAP and open techniques for reduction of intussusception. We did not find a significant difference between groups with respect to operative time, overall complication rates, or reoperation rates. However, the length of hospital stay was significantly longer in the open group. Conclusions: LAP reduction of intussusception is a safe and feasible alternative to the open approach. Length of stay may be shorter in the LAP group.' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;Abstract: Background: Intestinal intussusception is a frequent cause of bowel obstruction in children.

- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;In summary, our data suggest that LAP reduction of intussusception is as technically feasible, safe, and efficacious as the open approach and may even be beneficial in shortening LOS.&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The authors summarize the main findings of the study.
- Response: [Yes]

P25. Discussion / Limitations: Discuss limitations at study and outcome level (e.g., risk of bias), and at review-level (e.g., incomplete retrieval of identified research, reporting bias).
- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Our results should be interpreted with caution, as there are some methodological limitations in our study.&quot;</span>

c t Background: Improvements in laparoscopic surgery have led to the introduction of laparoendoscopic single-site surgery (LESS) as an alternative to conventional laparoscopy conferring a number of possible advantages. In this review, we aim to elucidate the aspects of LESS for major urological procedures in the pediatric population. Materials and methods: An in-depth search of the literature was performed in the databases of PubMed and Scopus, for studies investigating the technical aspects and clinical outcomes of partial nephrectomies, nephrectomies, nephroureterectomies, varicocelectomies and pyeloplasties in children. Data on parameters such as operation time, instrumentation, perioperative complications, hospital stay and follow up period were collected and further analyzed cumulatively. Results: Twenty nine studies met the inclusion criteria incorporating 386 patients who underwent 401 procedures. There were no major intraoperative complications, with only 19 patients (4.73%) facing postoperative complications. No perioperative deaths were reported. Conclusions: In the hands of experienced surgeons LESS seems a feasible, efficient and less invasive alternative to standard laparoscopy in the field of pediatric urology. There is an eminent need of welldesigned randomized controlled trials comparing the two techniques.' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;Abstract: Background: Improvements in laparoscopic surgery have led to the introduction of laparoendoscopic single-site surgery (LESS) as an alternative to conventional laparoscopy conferring a number of possible advantages.

Quotes: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;In the hands of experienced surgeons LESS seems a feasible and attractive alter- native to CL with comparable results. However, there is not enough evidence to support the superiority of LESS thus wide adoption cannot be recommended. There is an imperative need of well- designed prospective randomized trials, with large number of pa- tients, in order to clarify the safety and long term efficacy of LESS for urological procedures in the pediatric population.&quot;</span>

Abstract Introduction: Radical nephrectomy (RN, or total nephrectomy) is the current gold-standard surgical treatment for children with Wilms tumors (WT). However, nephron-sparing surgery (NSS, or partial nephrectomy) has recently been gaining increasing attention. The objective of this systematic review is to compare the effectiveness of NSS as compared with RN for the treatment of children with WT. Methods: We searched the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, clinicaltrials.gov, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Google Scholar, and recently presented meeting abstracts for reports in English. The bibliographies of included studies were then hand-searched for any missed articles. The protocol was prospectively registered. Manuscripts were assessed and data abstracted in duplicate with differences resolved by the senior author. Owing to high heterogeneity among the final included studies, only a qualitative systematic review was performed; no formal meta-analysis was undertaken. Results: We identified 694 articles, 118 of which were selected for full-text review and 66 of which were included in the final analysis. Most studies were single- or multi-institution retrospective case series (60, 91%), with a small number of prospective cohort studies (6, 9%) and 1 administrative database analysis. Most studies were from Europe (27, 41%) or North America (21, 32%). Nearly half (32, 48%) of studies those were included were dated from 2010 or later. In total, data on 4,002 patients were included, of whom 1,040 (26%) underwent NSS and 2,962 (74%) underwent NSS. Reported rupture rates were similar between RN and NSS (13% vs. 7%), as were recurrence rates (12% vs. 11%) and survival rates (85% vs. 88%). However, these comparisons are limited by inherent biases in the design and reporting of most included studies. Conclusions: Most contemporary studies reporting the use of NSS in children with WT report similar long-term outcomes to RN. However, most existing studies are limited by their small numbers, inconsistent reporting, and methodological biases. There are significant opportunities for future research on the use of NSS in children with WT, including issues related to surgical quality, optimal technique, timing and duration of chemotherapy, and variation in the use of NSS among centers. r 2016 Elsevier Inc.

P3. Introduction / Rationale: Describe the rationale for the review in the context of what is already known.
- Quote: <span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 96.2%):

Introduction Wilms tumor (WT) is the most common solid renal malignancy in children; the estimated annual incidence rate is 7 to 10 cases per million for children younger than 15 years. The Children&#39;s Oncology Group (COG) identifies approximately 600 children per year in the United States with a renal tumor, more than 90% of which are WT. Bilateral WT are relatively uncommon, accounting for 5% to 7% of children with renal tumors [1,2]. Multimodality therapy, including radical nephrectomy (RN) via a transperitoneal approach is the mainstay of WT management [3]. Historically, nephron-sparing surgery (NSS) was generally reserved for bilateral WT or children with a solitary kidney in whom preservation of renal' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;Introduction: Wilms tumor (WT) is the most common solid renal malignancy in children; the estimated annual incidence rate is 7 to 10 cases per million for children younger than 15 years.

Abstract Introduction The aim of this article is to identify the ideal type and location of colostomy in children with colorectal disease. Patients and Methods A retrospective case study of children with an anorectal malformation who received a colostomy, born between January 1990 and July 2012. Furthermore, a systematic literature search on colostomies in neonates with an anorectal malformation or Hirschsprung disease. Colostomies were classified as loop or split colostomies in the transverse or sigmoid colon. Outcome measures were mortality and complications such as prolapse, technical difficulties with the reconstruction, urinary tract infections, and others. Results The mortality rate in the 180 children with anorectal malformation was 6%, and none of them were directly related to stoma formation or closure. The overall complication rate was 23% and the specific rates for the two types of procedures and the two locations of the colostomy did not differ (p ¼ 0.389 and p ¼ 0.667, respectively). All prolapses (n ¼ 22) occurred in loop colostomies in the transverse colon. One colostomy required revision because of insufficient length for the reconstruction. Urinary tract infections were not documented. A total of eight studies were included in the systematic review (1982–2011; 2,954 patients). Mortality ranged between 0.1 and 11%. Loop colostomies had more complications than split colostomies (63 vs. 45%; p ¼ 0.007), mainly prolapse (18 vs. 6%; p < 0.001). Overall complication rate differed between transverse en sigmoid colostomies (62 vs. 51%, p ¼ 0.006), and prolapse occurred more often in the transverse colon (23 vs. 7%; p < 0.001). Revision because of insufficient length during the reconstruction was needed in 0 to 6%. Two studies reported on urinary tract infections which are as follows: One showed no difference between loop or split colostomies, whereas the other showed frequent episodes of urinary tract infections in 64% of the loop colostomies. Conclusions The complication to be avoided in transverse colostomies is prolapse and the surgical technique should be modified accordingly. The procedure of split sigmoid colostomy is meticulous, and the risk of insufficient length for the reconstruction remains.' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;Abstract: Introduction The aim of this article is to identify the ideal type and location of colostomy in children with colorectal disease.

Response: [Yes]

P3. Introduction / Rationale: Describe the rationale for the review in the context of what is already known.
Quotes: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Anorectal malformations and Hirschsprung disease are congenital malformations that show a wide clinical variety. In children with a high anorectal malformation, a colostomy is constructed in the neonatal period when direct reconstruction in the first few days of life is not possible. The colostomy is closed after reconstructive surgery later in life. In children with Hirschsprung disease, a stoma is formed if the bowel cannot be decompressed with the use of rectal washouts. The stoma is closed after the aganglionic bowel has been resected and a pull-through procedure has been performed.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: The authors provide a rationale for the review in the context of what is already known about anorectal malformations and Hirschsprung disease.
Response: [Yes]

P4. Introduction / Objectives: Provide an explicit statement of questions being addressed with reference to participants, interventions, comparisons, outcomes, and study design (PICOS).
Quotes: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The aim of this article is to identify the ideal type and location of colostomy in children with colorectal disease.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: The authors provide an explicit statement of the research question, but they do not explicitly mention the PICOS components.
Response: [No]

P5. Methods / Protocol and registration: Indicate if a review protocol exists, if and where it can be accessed (e.g., Web address), and, if available, provide registration information including registration number.
Quotes: None.
Reasoning: The text does not provide information on whether a review protocol exists or where it can be accessed.
Response: [No]

P6. Methods / Eligibility criteria: Specify study characteristics (e.g., PICOS, length of follow-up) and report characteristics (e.g., years considered, language, publication status) used as criteria for eligibility, giving rationale.
Quotes: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Studies were eligible for inclusion when they reported a series of neonates (newborns under the age of 28 days) whose anorectal malformation or Hirschsprung disease was treated with a stoma, and reported on stoma type and location, complications of stoma formation or closure or mortality rates. Studies excluded were the case series of less than 10 patients, articles that were not written in English, and articles that did not provide information on stoma type and location. Studies from developing countries were excluded because of the different setting compared with the developed countries. In case of duplicate publications, the most recent publication was included.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: The authors specify the study characteristics and report characteristics used as criteria for eligibility and provide a rationale for their choices.
Response: [Yes]

P7. Methods / Information sources: Describe all information sources (e.g., databases with dates of coverage, contact with study authors to identify additional studies) in the search and date last searched.
Quotes: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;A systematic literature search was conducted in the PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science databases with the help of an experienced librarian.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: The authors describe the information sources used in the search, but they do not provide the dates of coverage or the date of the last search.
Response: [No]

P8. Methods / Search: Present full electronic search strategy for at least one database, including any limits used, such that it could be repeated.
Quotes: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The general search terms were the same for the three databases, which are as follows: anorectal malformations, Hirschsprung disease, colostomy, and children.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: The authors provide some information on the search strategy, but they do not provide a full electronic search strategy that could be repeated.
Response: [No]

P9. Methods / Study selection: State the process for selecting studies (i.e., screening, eligibility, included in systematic review, and, if applicable, included in the meta-analysis).
Quotes: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Two investigators (D.H. and C.S.) independently screened titles and abstracts of retrieved citations, retrieved full texts of eligible articles, and selected relevant articles matching the selection criteria described below. Disagreements were resolved by discussion.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: The authors describe the process for selecting studies.
Response: [Yes]

P10. Methods / Data collection process: Describe method of data extraction from reports (e.g., piloted forms, independently, in duplicate) and any processes for obtaining and confirming data from investigators.
Quotes: <span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 99.2%):

Reasoning: The authors describe the method of data extraction from reports.
Response: [Yes]

P11. Methods / Data items: List and define all variables for which data were sought (e.g., PICOS, funding sources) and any assumptions and simplifications made.
Quotes: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;These data concerned study design, study population, follow-up, survival, complications, and reoperations. Primary outcome measure was complication rate in relation to colostomy type (loop or split colostomy) and location (transverse colon or sigmoid colon). Secondary outcome measures were mortality rate, requirement of stoma revision, and complications after stoma closure.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: The authors list and define the variables for which data were sought.

P1. Title: Identify the report as a systematic review, meta-analysis, or both.
- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Outcomes in distal hypospadias: A systematic review of the Mathieu and tubularized incised plate repairs&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The title clearly identifies the report as a systematic review.
- Response: [Yes]

P2. Abstract / Structured summary: Provide a structured summary including, as applicable: background; objectives; data sources; study eligibility criteria, participants, and interventions; study appraisal and synthesis methods; results; limitations; conclusions and implications of key findings; systematic review registration number.
- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Abstract Aim: To compare complication rates after distal hypospadias surgery using the tubularized incised plate (TIP) and Mathieu techniques. Methods: For this meta-analysis, the Medline (1990e2009), Embase (1990e2009) and Cochrane databases were searched using the keyword ‘hypospadias’. Inclusion criteria were: i) primary repairs; ii) distal hypospadias; iii) paediatric case series; iv) standard Mathieu and TIP techniques; v) complication data obtainable from the paper. Cases were only included in the denominator for each complication if explicitly identified in the paper. Fisher’s exact was used for statistical analysis, with P < 0.05 considered significant. Main results: 129 papers were selected for full analysis; 23 papers met the inclusion criteria comprising 1872 TIP repairs and 1496 Mathieu repairs. We identified an increased incidence of urethral fistulae with the Mathieu technique (3.8% vs 5.3%, P Z 0.028); however, this is lost on subgroup analysis. An increased incidence of meatal stenosis was identified in the TIP group (3.1% vs 0.7%, P < 0.001). Conclusions: There is no clear consensus on the ideal method of repair for distal hypospadias. Both the Mathieu and TIP techniques have been shown to have low rates of postoperative complications. Comparison between series is difficult because of a lack of consistency in reporting complications and follow up. We advocate uniform standards for reporting outcomes of hypospadias.&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The abstract provides a structured summary of the review, including background, objectives, data sources, study eligibility criteria, methods, results, and conclusions.
- Response: [Yes]

Abstract Purpose: Laparoscopic herniorrhaphy (LH) has been evolved as a minimally invasive technique for pediatric inguinal hernias (PIHs). Considerable debate exists regarding the benefits of LH over conventional open herniorrhaphy (OH). The aim of this review was to critique the current literature to determine the efficacy of LH. Methods: Published studies until July 30, 2010, were searched from Medline, Embase, Ovid, Web of Science, and Cochrane databases. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and observational clinical studies (OCSs) with a comparison of LH and OH were included. A systemic review and meta-analysis were performed using the odds ratios (ORs) for dichotomous variables and weighted mean differences (WMDs) for continuous variables. Results: Of 138 studies, 3 RCTs and 4 OCSs were eligible for inclusion criteria, comprising 1543 cases of LH and 657 cases of OH. Compared with OH, shorter operative time for bilateral hernias (WMD = −11.14; 95% confidence interval [CI], −20.61 to −1.68; P = .02) and lower rate of metachronic contralateral hernia (OR, 0.26; 95% CI, 0.09-0.76; P = .01) were noted in LH. However, no significant difference was observed between LH and OH in patients&#39; age, sex, affected side, operative time for unilateral hernias, duration of hospital stay, time to resume full activity, recurrence, and complications. Conclusions: Laparoscopic herniorrhaphy is superior to OH in the repair of bilateral PIH and lower rate of metachronic contralateral hernia, with similar operative time for unilateral hernias, length of hospital stay, recurrence, and complication rates. Because of the publishing bias, a series of RCTs with standard report format and uniform unit are necessary to explore the efficiencies of LH in the management of PIH.' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;Abstract: Purpose: Laparoscopic herniorrhaphy (LH) has been evolved as a minimally invasive technique for pediatric inguinal hernias (PIHs).

- Answer: [Yes]

P3. Introduction / Rationale: Describe the rationale for the review in the context of what is already known.
- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Inguinal hernias, one of the inguinoscrotal abnormalities because of failure to close the processus vaginalis, are common conditions of infancy and childhood [1]. Herniotomy is the standard procedure for pediatric inguinal hernia (PIH), with a high success rate and low rate of complications [2]. The principle for the repair of PIH is the complete ligation of patent processus vaginalis [3]. Some patients develop hernia on the opposite side after surgical repair, which is known as metachronous contralateral inguinal hernia (MCIH) [4]. Recurrence after an open procedure may be attributed to a failure to ligate the sac high enough at the internal ring, injury to the floor of inguinal canal because of operative trauma, failure to close the internal ring in girls, or postoperative wound infection and hematoma [5]. Therefore, contralateral exploration and postoperative hernia recurrence remain the major problems of conventional open herniorrhaphy (OH) in children with an indirect hernia [5]. In addition, injury to the reproductive system is the most frequent causes of infertility because of childhood inguinal herniorrhaphy [6]. Thus, it remains one of the duties for pediatric surgeons to improve the treatment of inguinal hernias.&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The authors provide a rationale for the review in the context of what is already known about pediatric inguinal hernias and their treatment.
- Answer: [Yes]

One hundred thirty-eight studies were initially found to report the LH in the management of PIH using the keywords laparoscopy and pediatric inguinal hernia. One hundred twenty-eight studies were published as complete articles and 10 as abstracts. After screening all titles and abstracts, the number of studies was reduced to 37 by limiting the inclusion criteria as laparoscopic herniorrhaphy, open herniorrhaphy, and pediatric inguinal hernia. After independent review, 23 publications dealing with comparison of LH and OH for the treatment of PIH were considered to be eligible for inclusion in the analysis. Sixteen of those studies were subsequently excluded Potentially relevant abstracts captured and screened (n = 138) Abstracts excluded because of failure to meet inclusion criteria, such as review article, no comparison of surgical interventions (n = 101) Articles retrieved for more detailed evaluation (n = 37) Articles excluded because of insufficient data and no quantitati ve data in children (' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ff9e81'>&quot;One hundred thirty-eight studies were initially found to report the LH in the management of PIH using the keywords laparoscopy and pediatric inguinal hernia.

a b s t r a c ta r t i c l e i n f o Article history: Received 19 January 2016 Accepted 7 February 2016 Key words: Gastroschisis Systematic review Meta-analysis Flap closure Background: Flap closure represents an alternative to fascial closure for gastroschisis. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of outcomes comparing these techniques. Methods: A registered systematic review (PROSPERO: CRD42015016745) of comparative studies was performed, querying multiple databases without language or date restrictions. Gray literature was sought. Outcomes analyzed included: mortality, ventilation days, feeding parameters, length of stay (LOS), wound infection, resource utilization, and umbilical hernia incidence. Multiple reviewers independently assessed study eligibility and literature quality. Meta-analysis of outcomes was performed where appropriate (Revman 5.2). Results: Twelve studies met inclusion criteria, of which three were multi-institutional. Quality assessment revealed unbiased patient selection and exposure, but group comparability was suboptimal in four studies. Overall, 1124 patients were evaluated, of which 350 underwent flap closure (210 immediately; 140 post-silo). Metaanalysis revealed no significant differences in mortality, LOS, or feeding parameters between groups. Flap patients had less wound infections (OR 0.40 [95%CI 0.22–0.74], P = 0.003). While flap patients had an increased risk of umbilical hernia, they were less likely to undergo repair (19% vs. 41%; P = 0.01). Conclusions: Flap closure has equivalent or superior outcomes to fascial closure for patients with gastroschisis. Given potential advantages of bedside closure and reduced sedation requirements, flap closure may represent the preferred closure strategy.' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;a b s t r a c t a r t i c l e i n f o Article history: Received 19 January 2016 Accepted 7 February 2016 Key words: Gastroschisis Systematic review Meta-analysis Flap closure Background: Flap closure represents an alternative to fascial closure for gastroschisis.

Response: [Yes]

P3. Introduction / Rationale: Describe the rationale for the review in the context of what is already known.
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Gastroschisis (GS) is a congenital full thickness defect of the ab- dominal wall that is increasing in prevalence worldwide [1,2]. Although the survival rate of neonates with GS is high, the burden of survivor morbidity remains considerable [3]. Various techniques have been described to close the defect, with the two most common methods being an operative fascial closure with sutures and a non- operative sutureless ‘flap’ closure [4].&quot;</span>
Reasoning: The introduction provides a rationale for the review in the context of what is already known about gastroschisis.
Response: [Yes]

P4. Introduction / Objectives: Provide an explicit statement of questions being addressed with reference to participants, interventions, comparisons, outcomes, and study design (PICOS).
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;With significant reported treatment variability of patients with GS and a lack of consensus regarding the best method to close the ab- dominal wall defect [11,12], the objective of this investigation was to compare the short-term outcomes of flap closure and fascial closure through a formal systematic literature review and meta-analysis.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: The introduction provides an explicit statement of the research question being addressed, with reference to participants (patients with GS), interventions (flap closure and fascial closure), comparisons (between flap closure and fascial closure), outcomes (short-term outcomes), and study design (systematic review and meta-analysis).
Response: [Yes]

P5. Methods / Protocol and registration: Indicate if a review protocol exists, if and where it can be accessed (e.g., Web address), and, if available, provide registration information including registration number.
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The protocol of this review was prospectively published in the PROSPERO registry (CRD42015016745) [13].&quot;</span>
Reasoning: The authors indicate that a review protocol exists, where it can be accessed (PROSPERO registry), and provide the registration number.
Response: [Yes]

P6. Methods / Eligibility criteria: Specify study characteristics (e.g., PICOS, length of follow-up) and report characteristics (e.g., years considered, language, publication status) used as criteria for eligibility, giving rationale.
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Our inclusion criteria were formulated according to the ‘PICOS’ format as follows: • Population: All infants born alive with the diagnosis of GS and who underwent abdominal defect closure. • Intervention: Sutureless flap closure either primarily or after silo reduction, in simple and complex GS cases. • Control: Operative fascial closure under general anesthesia either primarily or after a silo, in simple and complex GS cases. • Outcomes: The primary outcome was mortality rate. Secondary outcomes included the length of hospital stay, the number of post-intervention days on mechanical ventilation, the number of post-intervention days on total parenteral nutrition (TPN), the number of Nil Per Os days (NPO), the incidence of surgical site infection, the incidence of umbilical hernia, the need for umbilical hernia repair, and markers of resource utilization. • Study type: Only comparative studies (retrospective or prospective) that included both the intervention and control group and that reported at least one outcome of interest were included.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: The authors specify the study characteristics (PICOS) and report characteristics used as criteria for eligibility.
Response: [Yes]

Reasoning: The authors mention a search strategy and refer to an appendix for details, but the full electronic search strategy is not provided in the text provided.
Response: [No]

P9. Methods / Study selection: State the process for selecting studies (i.e., screening, eligibility, included in systematic review, and, if applicable, included in the meta-analysis).
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;All of the resulting titles were twice inspected independently; papers were excluded if one of the following exclusion criteria were met: basic science or animal studies, non-comparative studies or case reports, or papers that did not include GS patients. Abstracts were then reviewed and papers further excluded based on irrelevant methods of closure, whether the method of the closure was clearly explained or not, and any study that did not include either the primary or the secondary out- comes of this review. Full texts of all titles that were deemed relevant by either reviewer (where possible) were then retrieved.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: The authors describe the process for selecting studies, including screening and eligibility criteria.

Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Available evidence justifies the increasing use of flap closure as a method to close the abdominal defect in patients with GS. It results in comparable short-term outcomes when compared to fascial closure, and obviates the need for general anesthesia in some cases. It also appears to reduce the rate of surgical site infections, and while the incidence of umbilical hernias is unsurprisingly higher, these may not need operative correction.&quot;</span>

Abstract Objectives To compare the safety and efficacy of minimally invasive surgery (MIS) with traditional open surgical approach for congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH). Methods A literature search was performed using the PubMed database, Embase, and the Cochrane central register of controlled trials using a defined set of criteria. The outcomes, which include post-operative mortality, incidence of hernia recurrence, rates of patch use and complications, were analyzed. Results We investigated nine studies, which included 507 patients. All studies were non-randomized historical control trials. The MIS group had a significantly lower rate of post-operative death with a risk ratio of 0.26 [95 % confidence interval (CI) 0.10–0.68; p = 0.006] but a greater incidence of hernia recurrence with a risk ratio of 3.42 (95 % CI 1.98–5.88; p \ 0.00001). Rates of prosthetic patch use were similar between the two groups. Fewer cases of surgical complications were found in the MIS group with a risk ratio of 0.66 (95 % CI 0.47–0.94; p = 0.02). Conclusions MIS for CDH repair is associated with lower post-operative mortality and morbidity compared with traditional open repair. Although rate of patch use appears to be comparable, the increased risk of CDH recurrence should not be ignored. The lack of well-controlled prospective trials still limits strong evaluations of the two surgical techniques.' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;Abstract.

P3. Introduction / Rationale: Describe the rationale for the review in the context of what is already known.
- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) is a congenital defect in diaphragm development, which occurs in approximately 1 in 2500–4000 live births [1]. Surgical repair via laparotomy or thoracotomy is the traditional treatment for patients with CDH. Since the first report by Silen et al. on thoracoscopic CDH repair in an adolescent in 1995 [2], minimally invasive surgery (MIS) techniques, both laparoscopic and thoracoscopic, have been considered as alternative approaches for CDH repair. However, this new technique has not gained widespread acceptance among surgeons mainly because of the controversy involving its safety and efficacy, such as mortality, recurrence rate and complication rate.&quot;</span>

Methods: The authors conducted a systematic review of the pediatric and adult literature about MIA, focusing on the technique and indications. Results: Minimally invasive adrenalectomy appears superior to open adrenalectomy for small tumors. The potential advantages of MIA are appealing for postoperative pain, risk of intestinal obstruction, and quality of scars. The most common approach is the transperitoneal lateral laparoscopy, which allows for a large working space. For small tumors or for bilateral adrenalectomy, the prone retroperitoneoscopy is a promising new technique. In children, the learning curve is an issue because the indications are rare. The most common indication is neuroblastoma without image-defined surgical risk factors. The incidence of local recurrence is low, but the follow-up is short in most cases. Conclusions: Minimally invasive adrenalectomy is promising for removal of small adrenal tumors. Long-term follow-up is required to evaluate the efficacy of MIA in neuroblastomas.

Methods: PUBMED, Web of science and Cochrane library were searched until Oct. 2014 to find eligible studies. WMD, OR, RD and their 95% CIs were used to estimate the difference.

In patients with nonperforated appendicitis, there is strong evidence that children should receive preoperative broadspectrum antibiotics (Grade A). 2. Broad-spectrum, single, or double agent therapy is as effective as and more cost-effective than triple agent therapy for the treatment of perforated appendicitis (Grade B). 3. The length of administration of IV antibiotics for children with perforated appendicitis should be based on clinical criteria, such as fever, pain, return of bowel function, and WBC count (Grade B). 4. In children with perforated appendicitis, a 5-day course of IV antibiotics is recommended. IV antibiotics are given initially, but completing the antibiotic course with oral antibiotics (total 7 days IV + oral) had similar results compared to a minimum 5-day course of IV antibiotics (Grade B). 5.

Materials and Methods: Published studies until the end of October 2010 were searched from Medline, Embase, Web of Science, Ovid, and Cochrane databases. The literature search, quality assessment, and data extraction were independently performed by two reviewers. A systematic review and meta-analysis were performed by using Review Manager 4.2.8 software. Results: Of 1403 studies, one randomized controlled trial (RCT), two prospective comparative studies, and six retrospective observational studies were eligible for inclusion criteria, comprising 694 cases of LP and 7334 cases of OP. The OP has significantly reduced operative time (weighted mean difference [WMD] = 59.00; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 41.15 to 76.85; P < 0.00001) and higher stent placement rate (odds ratio [OR] = 5.97; 95% CI = 3.17 to 11.26; P < 0.00001) compared with LP, whereas the duration of hospital stay was shorter in the LP group (WMD = - 0.40; 95% CI = - 0.77 to - 0.03; P = 0.03).

The two most commonly performed methods of reconstruction after excision are hepaticoduodenostomy (HD) and Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy (HJ), of which the HJ is favored by most surgeons. Evidence concerning the optimal method of reconstruction is, however, sparse. Materials and Methods: Studies comparing outcomes from HD and HJ after choledochal cyst excision were identified by searching Medline, Ovid, Search Medica, Elsevier Clinicalkey, Google Scholar and Cochrane library. Suitable studies were chosen and data extracted for meta-analysis. Outcomes evaluated included operative time, hospital stay and incidence of postoperative bile leak, cholangitis, reflux/gastritis, anastomotic stricture, bleeding, intestinal obstruction and re-operative rate. Pooled odds ratios (OR) were calculated for dichotomous variables; pooled mean differences (MD) were measured for continuous variables. Results: Six retrospective studies were included in this meta-analysis, comprising a total of 679 patients, 412 of whom (60.7%) underwent HD, and the remainder, 267(39.3%) underwent HJ. Although, HD group had slightly shorter hospital stay (MD: 0.30; 95% CI: −0.22–0.39; P b 0.00001) it showed a higher incidence of postoperative reflux/gastritis (OR: 0.08; 95% CI: − 0.02–0.39; P = 0.002). However, the other outcomes such as bile leak, cholangitis, anastomotic stricture, bleeding, operative time, reoperation rate and adhesive intestinal obstruction did not differ between HD and HJ groups. Conclusions: HD shows higher postoperative reflux/gastritis than HJ but a shorter hospital stay. There are few good-quality studies that compare the outcomes from HD and HJ, meaning that caution should be exercised in the generalization of the results of this meta-analysis, which suggests HD to be comparable with HJ in terms of other complications, operative benefits and outcomes.' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;Abstract: Background: Excision has been established as a standard management practice for choledochal cysts in the last few decades.

There are few good-quality studies that compare the outcomes from HD and HJ, meaning that caution should be exercised in the generalization of the results of this meta-analysis, which suggests HD to be comparable with HJ in terms of other complications, operative benefits and outcomes.&quot;<\/span>","<span title='Minor quote deviation.

Materials and methods A systematic literature search was undertaken, using Medline and Pubmed, in order to identify relevant articles. Random effects models were used to estimate pooled complication rates. Meta-regression was performed for each outcome by using mixed effects models with type of hypospadias (primary distal, primary proximal and secondary) as predictors. Results Of the 189 articles that were identified, 49 studies (4675 patients) were included in the analysis. Fistula and re-operation rates were significantly higher in secondary repairs (15.5% and 23.3%) compared to primary proximal (10.3% and 12.2%) and primary distal (5.7% and 4.5%) (P Z 0.045 and P < 0.001, respectively). Technical modifications reduced fistula rates from 10.3% to 3.3% (P Z 0.003) and reoperation rates from 13.6% to 2.8% (P Z 0.001). The rate of meatal stenosis was highest in the secondary repairs, with follow-up >1 year (12.7%). Comparison of geographical location showed that complication rates for all but one variable were significantly lower in North America when compared to Europe and the rest of the world. Mean meatal stenosis rates were 1.8% in North America, 3.4% in Europe and 8.2% in the rest of the world (P Z 0.002). This remained significant in a multivariable model incorporating repair technique and length of follow-up (P Z 0.046). Mean rates of urethral stricture, fistula and re-operation followed a similar pattern (P Z 0.045, P Z 0.009 and P < 0.001, respectively). Mean follow-up was shortest in the North American group, at 11.9 months, compared to Europe, at 17.8 months, and the rest of the world, at 18.9 months. Discussion The present meta-analysis has shown that the lowest complication rates for the TIP repair are when it is applied to primary distal hypospadias. Complication rates are higher for all variables when the TIP repair is used for primary proximal hypospadias. Lower complication rates than those reported in this TIP review have been documented in some studies using a staged repair for correction of primary proximal or secondary hypospadias [11,12,68], implying that a staged approach may be superior to the TIP repair in these settings. Documentation of follow-up duration was limited, making assessment of the impact of length of follow-up difficult. Geographical location had a noticeable effect on outcome, with all but one complication being lower in the North American than the other groups. Mean follow-up was shortest in North America and it is suggested that the short follow-up in the North American studies may have led to under-reporting of late complications.

We compared the complication rate of absorbable (Surgisis [SIS]; Cook Biotech, Inc, West Lafayette, IN) and nonabsorbable (polytetrafluoroethylene [PTFE]) materials for this purpose. Methods: This is a retrospective review of all neonates with CDH undergoing patch closure at our institution over 10 years. Meta-analysis was also performed combining our data with the published literature examining the effect of patch type on recurrence and small bowel obstruction (SBO). Results: Primary patch (13 SIS, 9 PTFE) repair was performed in 22 (26%) of 84 patients with CDH. Groups were comparable in terms of demographics, hospital stay, ventilator days, need for high frequency oscillation, age at surgery, and length of follow-up. Likewise, recurrence rate (SIS, 4 [31%]; PTFE, 3 [33%]; P, nonsignificant [NS]), incidence of postoperative SBO (SIS, 1 [7%] vs PTFE, 2 [22%]; P, NS), and mortality (SIS, 2 [15%] and PTFE, 2 [22%]; P, NS) were similar.

Objective The primary objective is to determine the best first-line treatment for pediatric achalasia based on the consolidation of the current literature that compares outcomes after pneumatic dilatation (PD) versus surgical myotomy (Heller esophagomyotomy [HM]). Data Sources A systematic review of English articles using OVID was performed. Study Selection OVID was used to search for articles focusing on the treatment of pediatric esophageal achalasia with PD versus HM. Data Extraction Independent extraction of data was performed by N.E.S using predefined data fields. Data Synthesis Seven articles were included in the systematic review. Techniques of HM and PD varied widely. The best first-line treatment of pediatric achalasia was determined to be HM in two articles, PD in one article, and equal efficacy in one article. Three articles concluded that appropriate initial treatment was determined by the age of the child.

Objective The primary objective is to determine the best first-line treatment for pediatric achalasia based on the consolidation of the current literature that compares outcomes after pneumatic dilatation (PD) versus surgical myotomy (Heller esophagomyotomy [HM]). Data Sources A systematic review of English articles using OVID was performed. Study Selection OVID was used to search for articles focusing on the treatment of pediatric esophageal achalasia with PD versus HM. Data Extraction Independent extraction of data was performed by N.E.S using predefined data fields. Data Synthesis Seven articles were included in the systematic review. Techniques of HM and PD varied widely. The best first-line treatment of pediatric achalasia was determined to be HM in two articles, PD in one article, and equal efficacy in one article. Three articles concluded that appropriate initial treatment was determined by the age of the child. Conclusion Adequate comparative data are lacking to determine the ideal treatment of pediatric achalasia. Appropriately designed randomized controlled trials with long-term follow-up are needed to determine ideal treatment algorithms in pediatric achalasia.&quot;<\/span>","<span title='Major quote deviation, possible hallucination.

If this fails, operative reduction is indicated. There is controversy regarding use of the laparoscopic (LAP) versus the conventional open approach. Patients and Methods: We performed a retrospective review of all children with intussusception who required operative reduction at our institution over a 12-year time period. We also performed a meta-analysis to combine our data with the published literature. Results: We identified 28 patients requiring operative intervention for reduction of intussusception between January 2000 and April 2012. Five patients underwent LAP reduction, and 23 patients underwent open reduction. Operative times were not statistically different. The rate of overall complications was not statistically different, with 1 of 5 (20%) and 7 of 23 (30%) having complications in the LAP and open groups, respectively. Mean length of stay was 3.8 – 2.1 days in both the LAP and open groups, with no significant difference. Our meta-analysis identified five retrospective studies comparing LAP and open techniques for reduction of intussusception. We did not find a significant difference between groups with respect to operative time, overall complication rates, or reoperation rates.

The objective of this systematic review is to compare the effectiveness of NSS as compared with RN for the treatment of children with WT. Methods: We searched the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, clinicaltrials.gov, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Google Scholar, and recently presented meeting abstracts for reports in English. The bibliographies of included studies were then hand-searched for any missed articles. The protocol was prospectively registered. Manuscripts were assessed and data abstracted in duplicate with differences resolved by the senior author. Owing to high heterogeneity among the final included studies, only a qualitative systematic review was performed; no formal meta-analysis was undertaken. Results: We identified 694 articles, 118 of which were selected for full-text review and 66 of which were included in the final analysis.

In total, data on 4,002 patients were included, of whom 1,040 (26%) underwent NSS and 2,962 (74%) underwent NSS. Reported rupture rates were similar between RN and NSS (13% vs. 7%), as were recurrence rates (12% vs. 11%) and survival rates (85% vs. 88%). However, these comparisons are limited by inherent biases in the design and reporting of most included studies. Conclusions: Most contemporary studies reporting the use of NSS in children with WT report similar long-term outcomes to RN. However, most existing studies are limited by their small numbers, inconsistent reporting, and methodological biases.

Patients and Methods A retrospective case study of children with an anorectal malformation who received a colostomy, born between January 1990 and July 2012. Furthermore, a systematic literature search on colostomies in neonates with an anorectal malformation or Hirschsprung disease. Colostomies were classified as loop or split colostomies in the transverse or sigmoid colon. Outcome measures were mortality and complications such as prolapse, technical difficulties with the reconstruction, urinary tract infections, and others. Results The mortality rate in the 180 children with anorectal malformation was 6%, and none of them were directly related to stoma formation or closure. The overall complication rate was 23% and the specific rates for the two types of procedures and the two locations of the colostomy did not differ (p ¼ 0.389 and p ¼ 0.667, respectively). All prolapses (n ¼ 22) occurred in loop colostomies in the transverse colon. One colostomy required revision because of insufficient length for the reconstruction. Urinary tract infections were not documented. A total of eight studies were included in the systematic review (1982–2011; 2,954 patients). Mortality ranged between 0.1 and 11%. Loop colostomies had more complications than split colostomies (63 vs. 45%; p ¼ 0.007), mainly prolapse (18 vs. 6%; p < 0.001). Overall complication rate differed between transverse en sigmoid colostomies (62 vs. 51%, p ¼ 0.006), and prolapse occurred more often in the transverse colon (23 vs. 7%; p < 0.001). Revision because of insufficient length during the reconstruction was needed in 0 to 6%. Two studies reported on urinary tract infections which are as follows: One showed no difference between loop or split colostomies, whereas the other showed frequent episodes of urinary tract infections in 64% of the loop colostomies. Conclusions The complication to be avoided in transverse colostomies is prolapse and the surgical technique should be modified accordingly.

Considerable debate exists regarding the benefits of LH over conventional open herniorrhaphy (OH). The aim of this review was to critique the current literature to determine the efficacy of LH. Methods: Published studies until July 30, 2010, were searched from Medline, Embase, Ovid, Web of Science, and Cochrane databases. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and observational clinical studies (OCSs) with a comparison of LH and OH were included. A systemic review and meta-analysis were performed using the odds ratios (ORs) for dichotomous variables and weighted mean differences (WMDs) for continuous variables. Results: Of 138 studies, 3 RCTs and 4 OCSs were eligible for inclusion criteria, comprising 1543 cases of LH and 657 cases of OH. Compared with OH, shorter operative time for bilateral hernias (WMD = −11.14; 95% confidence interval [CI], −20.61 to −1.68; P = .02) and lower rate of metachronic contralateral hernia (OR, 0.26; 95% CI, 0.09-0.76; P = .01) were noted in LH. However, no significant difference was observed between LH and OH in patients&#39; age, sex, affected side, operative time for unilateral hernias, duration of hospital stay, time to resume full activity, recurrence, and complications. Conclusions: Laparoscopic herniorrhaphy is superior to OH in the repair of bilateral PIH and lower rate of metachronic contralateral hernia, with similar operative time for unilateral hernias, length of hospital stay, recurrence, and complication rates.

Results: Twelve studies met inclusion criteria, of which three were multi-institutional.

Results We investigated nine studies, which included 507 patients. All studies were non-randomized historical control trials. The MIS group had a significantly lower rate of post-operative death with a risk ratio of 0.26 [95 % confidence interval (CI) 0.10–0.68; p = 0.006] but a greater incidence of hernia recurrence with a risk ratio of 3.42 (95 % CI 1.98–5.88; p \\ 0.00001). Rates of prosthetic patch use were similar between the two groups. Fewer cases of surgical complications were found in the MIS group with a risk ratio of 0.66 (95 % CI 0.47–0.94; p = 0.02). Conclusions MIS for CDH repair is associated with lower post-operative mortality and morbidity compared with traditional open repair.

The aim of this study was to identify clinical evidence about the reliability of this technique in the recent literature. Methods: We performed a Medline search for articles published during the last 10 years, using the key words “varicocele,” “treatment,” and “adolescent.” As limits, we used last 10 years, adolescent, clinical trials, randomized controlled trials, meta-analysis, and multicenter retrospective and prospective studies. The results were investigated in recurrence and hydrocele formation. Results: We pooled 37 studies, but 26 of these were excluded because they were neither relevant nor concerned an adolescent population. Meta-analysis showed that there was no statistical difference between laparoscopic surgery and open surgery in recurrence rate and postoperative hydrocele rate. In the laparoscopic group, the incidence of recurrence was higher in the patients undergoing artery ligation compared to patients undergoing artery and venous ligation. Furthermore, a lower rate of postoperative hydrocele was recorded in patients undergoing dye injections before laparoscopic ligation.

The aim of this study was to identify clinical evidence about the reliability of this technique in the recent literature. Methods: We performed a Medline search for articles published during the last 10 years, using the key words “varicocele,” “treatment,” and “adolescent.” As limits, we used last 10 years, adolescent, clinical trials, randomized controlled trials, meta-analysis, and multicenter retrospective and prospective studies. The results were investigated in recurrence and hydrocele formation. Results: We pooled 37 studies, but 26 of these were excluded because they were neither relevant nor concerned an adolescent population. Meta-analysis showed that there was no statistical difference between laparoscopic surgery and open surgery in recurrence rate and postoperative hydrocele rate. In the laparoscopic group, the incidence of recurrence was higher in the patients undergoing artery ligation compared to patients undergoing artery and venous ligation. Furthermore, a lower rate of postoperative hydrocele was recorded in patients undergoing dye injections before laparoscopic ligation. Conclusions: Meta-analysis and literature analysis showed that the results after laparoscopic varicocelectomy are comparable to other surgical procedures. The laparoscopic approach has the advantage to treat simultaneously bilateral varicocele.&quot;<\/span>","<span title='Minor quote deviation.

The benefitsof TERPT over the conventional transabdominal approach(TAB)are still unclear. We performed a comprehensive meta-analysis comparing the clinical outcomes of TERPT and TAB. Methods: Original articles published from 1998 to 2012 were searched from Medline, Embase, and Cochrane databases. Randomized controlled trials (RCT) and observational clinical studies (OCS) comparing TERPT and TAB were included. Outcomes evaluated included operative time, hospital stay and incidence of postoperative incontinence/soiling, constipation and enterocolitis. Pooled odds ratios (OR) were calculated for dichotomous variables; pooled mean differences (MD) were measured for continuous variables. Results: Of 93 studies, 1 RCT and 11 OCS were included, comprising 444 cases of TERPT and 348 cases of TAB (215 Soave, 94 Duhamel, 24 Swenson, 15 Rehbein procedures). TERPT had shorter operative time (MD = −57.85 min; 95% confidence interval [CI], −83.11 to − 32.60; P b 0.00001) and hospital stay (MD = −7.06 days; 95% CI, −10.95 to −3.16; P = 0.0004).

Methods: A review of literature was performed. N = 39 publications were reviewed. Results: For LILT and STEP, failure to achieve intestinal autonomy by conservative therapy represents the main indication, and end-stage liver disease the main contraindication. A sufficiently dilated intestinal segment is a common anatomical precondition for both procedures. STEP can be performed on shorter intestinal segments and on intricate segments such as the duodenum, which is technically not feasible for LILT. Both procedures have a similar extent of intestinal lengthening (approximately 70%) and result in improvement of enteral nutrition and reversal of complications of parenteral nutrition. STEP seems to have a lower mortality and overall progression to transplantation. Conclusions: STEP and LILT are both accepted procedures for non-transplant surgical management of SBS in children.

warranted.&quot;<\/span>"],[99.2481203007519,63.6363636363636,96.4788732394366,62.5,98.3333333333333,96.4788732394366,99.4652406417112,99.4652406417112,99.7506234413965,99.8727735368957,99.9110320284697,98.3333333333333,99.9229583975347,87.8048780487805,56.2091503267974,56.2091503267974,98.9100817438692,99.9217527386541,83.9285714285714,84.020618556701,96.6666666666667,95.6521739130435,99.1935483870968,97.2222222222222,98.8636363636364,99.6415770609319,99.8603351955307,93.3333333333333,98.9690721649485,99.9464954521134,76.8679631525077,99.746835443038,96.9387755102041,99.438202247191,99.5169082125604,98.936170212766,99.438202247191,79.1338582677165,79.1338582677165,99.7899159663866,98.989898989899,99.6031746031746,99.6268656716418,99.7792494481236,99.9450549450549,98.7252124645892,99.8050682261209,99.5951417004049,99.4459833795014,97.8142076502732,98.7577639751553,99.2248062015504,98.7577639751553,99.2248062015504,99.5203836930456,98.0487804878049,69.2307692307692,99.3630573248408,96.4664310954064,85.2348993288591,98.3783783783784,97.0833333333333,91.304347826087,96.4664310954064,92.4812030075188,96.5034965034965,66.1157024793389,98.6899563318777,73.7541528239203,97.6303317535545,96.5034965034965,99.3630573248408,99.7727272727273,98.75,97.0238095238095,99.8158379373849,76.1194029850746,99.6598639455782,97.3684210526316,99.7867803837953,99.9424956871765,85.6353591160221,99.3103448275862,37.2093023255814,99.2647058823529,99.4117647058823,99.3150684931507,99.9500998003992,99.3150684931507,76.4150943396226,99.0740740740741,99.7311827956989,99.6884735202492,99.1869918699187,99.4871794871795,93.9597315436242,99.4871794871795,66.3934426229508,99.3377483443709,63.2183908045977,99.5049504950495,99.7575757575758,95.2380952380952,99.7084548104956,92.8571428571429,97.1153846153846,57.9634464751958,97.1153846153846,99.5884773662551,99.618320610687,84.1836734693878,99.5884773662551,99.7555012224939,76.657060518732,99.911426040744,96.2962962962963,99.8203054806828,99.7142857142857,99.7744845360825,98.9690721649485,94.9640287769784,97.7272727272727,97.682119205298,99.609375,99.7792494481236,99.609375,99.9328859060403,99.3243243243243,99.622641509434,99.6860282574568,99.6860282574568,57.3426573426573,99.9019607843137,88.0597014925373,57.3426573426573,99.9514798641436,95.1690821256039,99.9281609195402,99.5215311004785,98.3606557377049,99.622641509434,99.3865030674847,99.5169082125604,99.7566909975669,99.2307692307692,98.9276139410188,99.622641509434,92.3076923076923,99.4594594594595,96.4912280701754,99.8589562764457,72.4279835390947,96.551724137931,71.8120805369127,99.6978851963746,99.7041420118343,99.5110024449878,99.8054474708171,99.8491704374057,99.4117647058823,99.4871794871795,98.6111111111111,89.2093023255814,99.6913580246914,99.899091826438,99.7787610619469,98.6111111111111,99.4117647058823,66.6666666666667,99.7885835095137,97.8723404255319,99.4459833795014,64.756446991404,97.8723404255319,98.3402489626556,99.0566037735849,98.3606557377049,99.7118155619597,98.3606557377049,99.8744507219083,99.492385786802,96.9465648854962,99.1875923190547,99.021207177814,99.468085106383,62.2119815668203,99.4594594594595,99.5689655172414,97.7443609022557,99.5951417004049,97.5,99.4652406417112,97.5,99.4652406417112,99.581589958159,99.6296296296296,98.7012987012987,98.7012987012987,70.2702702702703,99.4413407821229,99.57805907173,99.2248062015504,70,98.9528795811518,69.7777777777778,96.2365591397849,95.6349206349206,97.289156626506,99.7663551401869,99.957337883959,81.4814814814815,99.2307692307692,99.9555752998667,96.5034965034965,96.0526315789474,98.6301369863014,95.4545454545455,99.6282527881041,99.2481203007519,98.6301369863014,99.4082840236686,99.2481203007519,99.6825396825397,99.2805755395683,99.6212121212121,99.7191011235955,99.6212121212121,98.9189189189189,81.2925170068027,97.1428571428571,81.7857142857143,97.1428571428571,99.5433789954338,96.0227272727273,98.4848484848485,92.0353982300885,99.5884773662551,99.390243902439,99.7304582210243,99.390243902439,99.7206703910614,91.4008321775312,99.9438517686693,59.9303135888502,99.2753623188406,99.7183098591549,99.6815286624204,98.1012658227848,99.3150684931507,96.3414634146341,98.8235294117647,99.3150684931507,95.7055214723926,98.932384341637,99.7126436781609,99.6563573883162,99.6389891696751,99.9288256227758,99.6563573883162,98.326359832636,99.1507430997877,99.746835443038,99.2063492063492,99.75,99.7933884297521,99.2063492063492,67.0995670995671,99.8901098901099,99.6958637469586,71.2418300653595,99.6655518394649,67.0995670995671,99.6551724137931,82.0175438596491,99.6515679442509,99.6845425867508,99.6478873239437,99.1666666666667,98.8304093567251,98.1981981981982,77.3869346733668,81.1594202898551,78.3185840707965,99.6323529411765,99.6323529411765,99.5316159250585,99.4594594594595,99.3311036789298,99.9304589707928,99.4594594594595,99.5260663507109,98.1818181818182,98.1818181818182,99.1228070175439,99.601593625498,99.6732026143791,85.4014598540146,99.8316498316498,99.7544505831799,95.238

<h4>System prompt</h4>
<pre>
You are an expert in systematic reviews and are tasked to assess the methodological quality of a systematic review with the AMSTAR tool and its reporting quality with the PRISMA tool based on the full text of its publication. AMSTAR and PRISMA consist of the following items:

&lt;AMSTAR&gt;
A1. Was an 'a priori' design provided? The research question and inclusion criteria should be established before the conduct of the review. Note: Need to refer to a protocol, ethics approval, or pre-determined/a priori published research objectives to score a “yes.”
A2. Was there duplicate study selection and data extraction? There should be at least two independent data extractors and a consensus procedure for disagreements should be in place. Note: 2 people do study selection, 2 people do data extraction, consensus process or one person checks the other’s work.
A3. Was a comprehensive literature search performed? At least two electronic sources should be searched. The report must include years and databases used (e.g., Central, EMBASE, and MEDLINE). Key words and/or MESH terms must be stated and where feasible the search strategy should be provided. All searches should be supplemented by consulting current contents, reviews, textbooks, specialized registers, or experts in the particular field of study, and by reviewing the references in the studies found. Note: If at least 2 sources + one supplementary strategy used, select “yes” (Cochrane register/Central counts as 2 sources; a grey literature search counts as supplementary).
A4. Was the status of publication (i.e. grey literature) used as an inclusion criterion? The authors should state that they searched for reports regardless of their publication type. The authors should state whether or not they excluded any reports (from the systematic review), based on their publication status, language etc. Note: If review indicates that there was a search for “grey literature” or “unpublished literature,” indicate “yes.” SIGLE database, dissertations, conference proceedings, and trial registries are all considered grey for this purpose. If searching a source that contains both grey and non-grey, must specify that they were searching for grey/unpublished lit.
A5. Was a list of studies (included and excluded) provided? A list of included and excluded studies should be provided. Note: Acceptable if the excluded studies are referenced. If there is an electronic link to the list but the link is dead, select “no.”
A6. Were the characteristics of the included studies provided? In an aggregated form such as a table, data from the original studies should be provided on the participants, interventions and outcomes. The ranges of characteristics in all the studies analyzed e.g., age, race, sex, relevant socioeconomic data, disease status, duration, severity, or other diseases should be reported. Note: Acceptable if not in table format as long as they are described as above.
A7. Was the scientific quality of the included studies assessed and documented? 'A priori' methods of assessment should be provided (e.g., for effectiveness studies if the author(s) chose to include only randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled studies, or allocation concealment as inclusion criteria); for other types of studies alternative items will be relevant. Note: Can include use of a quality scoring tool or checklist, e.g., Jadad scale, risk of bias, sensitivity analysis, etc., or a description of quality items, with some kind of result for EACH study (“low” or “high” is fine, as long as it is clear which studies scored “low” and which scored “high”; a summary score/range for all studies is not acceptable).
A8. Was the scientific quality of the included studies used appropriately in formulating conclusions? The results of the methodological rigor and scientific quality should be considered in the analysis and the conclusions of the review, and explicitly stated in formulating recommendations. Note: Might say something such as “the results should be interpreted with caution due to poor quality of included studies.” Cannot score “yes” for this question if scored “no” for question A7.
A9. Were the methods used to combine the findings of studies appropriate? For the pooled results, a test should be done to ensure the studies were combinable, to assess their homogeneity (i.e., Chi-squared test for homogeneity, I2 ). If heterogeneity exists a random effects model should be used and/or the clinical appropriateness of combining should be taken into consideration (i.e., is it sensible to combine?). Note: Indicate “yes” if they mention or describe heterogeneity, i.e., if they explain that they cannot pool because of heterogeneity/variability between interventions.
A10. Was the likelihood of publication bias assessed? An assessment of publication bias should include a combination of graphical aids (e.g., funnel plot, other available tests) and/or statistical tests (e.g., Egger regression test, Hedges-Olken). Note: If no test values or funnel plot included, score “no”. Score “yes” if mentions that publication bias could not be assessed because there were fewer than 10 included studies.
A11. Was the conflict of interest included? Potential sources of support should be clearly acknowledged in both the systematic review and the included studies. Note: To get a “yes,” must indicate source of funding or support for the systematic review AND for each of the included studies..
&lt;/AMSTAR&gt;
&lt;PRISMA&gt;
P1. Title: Identify the report as a systematic review, meta-analysis, or both.
P2. Abstract / Structured summary: Provide a structured summary including, as applicable: background; objectives; data sources; study eligibility criteria, participants, and interventions; study appraisal and synthesis methods; results; limitations; conclusions and implications of key findings; systematic review registration number.
P3. Introduction / Rationale: Describe the rationale for the review in the context of what is already known.
P4. Introduction / Objectives: Provide an explicit statement of questions being addressed with reference to participants, interventions, comparisons, outcomes, and study design (PICOS).
P5. Methods / Protocol and registration: Indicate if a review protocol exists, if and where it can be accessed (e.g., Web address), and, if available, provide registration information including registration number.
P6. Methods / Eligibility criteria: Specify study characteristics (e.g., PICOS, length of follow-up) and report characteristics (e.g., years considered, language, publication status) used as criteria for eligibility, giving rationale.
P7. Methods / Information sources: Describe all information sources (e.g., databases with dates of coverage, contact with study authors to identify additional studies) in the search and date last searched.
P8. Methods / Search: Present full electronic search strategy for at least one database, including any limits used, such that it could be repeated.
P9. Methods / Study selection: State the process for selecting studies (i.e., screening, eligibility, included in systematic review, and, if applicable, included in the meta-analysis).
P10. Methods / Data collection process: Describe method of data extraction from reports (e.g., piloted forms, independently, in duplicate) and any processes for obtaining and confirming data from investigators.
P11. Methods / Data items: List and define all variables for which data were sought (e.g., PICOS, funding sources) and any assumptions and simplifications made.
P12. Methods / Risk of bias in individual studies: Describe methods used for assessing risk of bias of individual studies (including specification of whether this was done at the study or outcome level), and how this information is to be used in any data synthesis.
P13. Methods / Summary measures: State the principal summary measures (e.g., risk ratio, difference in means).
P14. Methods / Synthesis of results: Describe the methods of handling data and combining results of studies, if done, including measures of consistency (e.g., I2) for each meta-analysis.
P15. Methdos / Risk of bias across studies: Specify any assessment of risk of bias that may affect the cumulative evidence (e.g., publication bias, selective reporting within studies).
P16. Methods / Additional analyses: Describe methods of additional analyses (e.g., sensitivity or subgroup analyses, meta-regression), if done, indicating which were pre-specified.
P17. Results / Study selection: Give numbers of studies screened, assessed for eligibility, and included in the review, with reasons for exclusions at each stage, ideally with a flow diagram.
P18. Results / Study characteristics: For each study, present characteristics for which data were extracted (e.g., study size, PICOS, follow-up period) and provide the citations.
P19. Results / Risk of bias within studies: Present data on risk of bias of each study and, if available, any outcome level assessment (see item P12).
P20. Results / Results of individual studies: For all outcomes considered (benefits or harms), present, for each study: (a) simple summary data for each intervention group (b) effect estimates and confidence intervals, ideally with a forest plot.
P21. Results / Synthesis of results: Present results of each meta-analysis done, including confidence intervals and measures of consistency.
P22. Results / Risk of bias across studies: Present results of any assessment of risk of bias across studies (see Item P15).
P23. Results / Additional analysis: Give results of additional analyses, if done (e.g., sensitivity or subgroup analyses, meta-regression [see Item P16]).
P24. Discussion / Summary of evidence: Summarize the main findings including the strength of evidence for each main outcome; consider their relevance to key groups (e.g., healthcare providers, users, and policy makers).
P25. Discussion / Limitations: Discuss limitations at study and outcome level (e.g., risk of bias), and at review-level (e.g., incomplete retrieval of identified research, reporting bias).
P26. Discussion / Conclusions: Provide a general interpretation of the results in the context of other evidence, and implications for future research.
P27. Funding: Describe sources of funding for the systematic review and other support (e.g., supply of data); role of funders for the systematic review.

%FULLTEXT%
&lt;/FULLTEXT&gt;

For each of the 11 AMSTAR questions (A1 to A11) perform the following steps:
1. Extract 1-3 relevant quotes from the full text.
2. Explain your reasoning in 1 sentence.
3. Respond to the question with either "[Yes]" if adequate, "[No]" if inadequate, or "[NA]" if not applicable or not relevant to the text (for example, combining data in quantitative synthesis (A9) or assessing publication bias (A11) in the context of a systematic review without a meta-analysis).

For each of the PRISMA items (P1 to P27) perform the following steps:
1. Extract 1-3 relevant quotes from the full text.
2. Explain your reasoning in 1 sentence.
3. Respond with either "[Yes]" if the item was reported, "[No]" if not reported, or "[NA]" if not applicable (for example, items P14, P15, P16, P21, P22, P23 in the context of a systematic review without a meta-analysis).

Before stopping, make sure you've processed all 11 AMSTAR questions and 27 PRISMA items. Do not provide a final summary paragraph in the end.
