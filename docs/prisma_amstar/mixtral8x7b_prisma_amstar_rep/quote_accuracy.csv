The purpose of this review is to update the use of MIS in pediatric oncological surgery over the past five years. Methods The authors conducted a systematic review of papers published between 2009 and 2014 focusing on indications and results of the technique. Results New indications in Wilms tumor, pheochromocytoma, and lung nodules have emerged, thanks to the growing use of MIS in benign urological and thoracic surgery with satisfactory results. Case control studies comparing MIS to open approach have been published for the first time in more classical indications such as neurogenic tumors, while robot-assisted procedure has shown concern in results about its early experience in solid tumors.

Results: We identified 28 patients requiring operative intervention for reduction of intussusception between January 2000 and April 2012.

Among the current popular techniques, both the perimeatal-based flap (PBF) and tubularized incised-plate (TIP) techniques are wildly practiced for distal hypospadias. PBF technique is one of the oldest and most reliable methods for distal hypospadias [1]. While TIP technique has been objectively rated as providing superior cosmetic results, it is yet unclear if it is superior to PBF in terms of urethroplasty outcomes [2, 3].",fulltext,"Introduction There are more than 300 surgical procedures for hypospadias repair, however, controversy continues over the ideal technique.

This review was conducted to compare the clinical and cost effectiveness of laparoscopic and open surgical approaches for a variety of surgical indications in pediatric populations. Method/ Design: A computerized comprehensive search supplemented by a manual review of the literature was performed for all peer-reviewed publications comparing laparo-scopic and open appendectomy, fundoplication and hernia repair cohorts. Outcomes of interest were length of stay (LOS), operating room (OR) time, complication rates and total hospital costs; aggregation of outcome rates was performed with the Mantel-Haenszel method. Results: A total of 24 articles were identified that met the search and inclusion criteria. LOS was found to be signifi-cantly reduced in favor of the laparoscopic approach, with a weighted mean difference of − 1.44 days, although the OR time was signifi-cantly increased, with a weighted mean difference of + 12.8 min. Laparoscopic intervention was associated with a significantly reduced complication rate compared to the open approach (10.6 vs. 15.6 % ). Total hospital costs of the laparoscopic approaches were found to be insignifi-cantly increased compared to the open techniques. Conclusion: This review further supports the use of minimally invasive surgery (MIS) in pediatric populations, demonstrating that the three types laparoscopic procedures reviewed resulted in better patient outcomes compared to open procedures, in the form of reduced LOS and over-all complication rates.

Materials and Methods: Studies published since 1992 that compared SILA versus TILA in laparoscopic appendicectomy were collected. Data on operative parameters, postoperative recovery, postoperative pain and complications, and hospitalization costs for SILA and TILA were meta-analyzed using fixed-effect and random-effect models. Results: Seventeen studies (1 randomized controlled trial and 16 retrospective studies) that included 1809 patients were studied. Of these patients, 793 and 1016 had undergone SILA and TILA, respectively. There was significantly shorter length of hospital stay; however, there were evidently higher conversion rate, and perhaps higher surgical difficulty and hospitalization costs for SILA compared with TILA. Other outcome variables such as operative time, blood loss, time to first oral intake, postoperative pain and complications were not found to be statistically significant for either group. Conclusions: Compared with TILA, SILA has the advantage of shorter hospital stay, and it can achieve comparable operative time, blood loss, postoperative recovery, postoperative pain and complications with TILA.

97,PRISMA,"Abstract / Structured summary: Background: Patients with malrotation, or an intestinal rotation abnormality (IRA), can experience serious adverse events. Increasingly, asymptomatic patients are being diagnosed with malrotation incidentally. Objectives: The treatment of asymptomatic or incidentally discovered malrotation remains controversial. Methods: Data were compiled from a broad search of Medline, Cochrane, Embase and Web of Science from January 1980 through January 2013 for five questions regarding asymptomatic malrotation. Results: There is minimal evidence to support screening asymptomatic patients. Consideration may be given to operate on asymptomatic patients who are younger in age, while observation may be appropriate in the older patient. If reliably diagnosed, atypical malrotation with a broad-based mesentery and malposition of the duodenum can be observed. Regarding diagnostic imaging, the standard of care for diagnosis remains the upper gastro-intestinal contrast study (UGI), ultrasound may be useful for screening. A laparoscopic approach is safe for diagnosis and treatment of rotational abnormalities. Laparoscopy can aid in determining whether a patient has true malrotation with a narrow mesenteric stalk, has nonrotation and minimal risk for volvulus, or has atypical anatomy with malposition of the duodenum. It is reasonable to delay Ladd procedures until after palliation on patients with severe congenital heart disease. Observation can be considered with extensive education for family and caregivers and close clinical follow-up. Conclusions: There is a lack of quality data to guide the management of patients with asymptomatic malrotation. Multicenter and prospective data should be collected to better assess the risk profile for this complex group of patients. A multidisciplinary approach involving surgery, cardiology, critical care and the patient's caregivers can help guide a watchful waiting management plan in individual cases.",fulltext,"e: Patients with malrotation, or an intestinal rotation abnormality (IRA), can experience serious adverse events.

Observation can be considered with extensive education for family and caregivers and close clinical follow-up. Conclusions: There is a lack of quality data to guide the management of patients with asymptomatic malrotation. Multicenter and prospective data should be collected to better assess the risk profile for this complex group of patients. A multidisciplinary approach involving surgery, cardiology, critical care and the patient's caregivers can help guide a watchful waiting management plan in individual cases.",97.72612430520465

99,PRISMA,"Background/purpose: Interval appendicectomy (IA) is commonly performed after successful nonoperative treatment of appendix mass (AM); although, this approach has recently been challenged. We systematically reviewed the pediatric literature with regard to the justification for this practice. Methods: Using a defined search strategy, studies were identified and data were extracted independently by 2 reviewers. Incidences of recurrent appendicitis, complications after IA, and carcinoid tumor were estimated accounting for interstudy heterogeneity. Cost and length of stay of IA were analyzed. Results: Three studies (127 cases) reporting routine nonsurgical treatment were identified; all were retrospective. There was marked interstudy heterogeneity and variable follow-up. After successful nonoperative treatment of AM, the risk of recurrent appendicitis is 20.5% (95% confidence interval [CI], 14.3%-28.4%). The incidence of complications after IA (23 studies, n = 1247) is 3.4% (95% CI, 2.2-5.1), and the incidence of carcinoid tumor found at IA (15 studies, n = 955) is 0.9% (95% CI, 0.5-1.8). No reports compared costs. Mean length of stay for IA is 3 days (range, 1-30 days). Conclusions: Prospective studies comparing routine IA with nonoperative treatment without IA in children are lacking. Available data suggest that 80% of children with AM may not need IA. A prospective study to evaluate the natural history of this condition compared with the morbidity and costs of IA is warranted.",fulltext,"Background/purpose: Interval appendicectomy (IA) is commonly performed after successful nonoperative treatment of appendix mass (AM); although, this approach has recently been challenged.
