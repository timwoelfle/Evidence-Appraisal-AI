Score: [3]

Recruitment:
Quotes: ""Patients (n=84) were recruited in collaboration with six Danish regional MS clinics and The Danish MS Society.""
Patients were recruited from multiple MS clinics and the national MS society, which is only a small step removed from recruiting directly through usual care appointments. This represents a relatively pragmatic approach to recruitment.
Score: [4]

Setting:
The trial was conducted across multiple MS clinics in Denmark, but no details are provided on how similar the settings were to usual MS care. There is not enough information to assess this domain.
Score: [NA] 

Organization:
Quotes: ""The supervised exercise sessions were performed twice weekly for the full study period of 48 weeks, and was planned on the basis of four principles (adapted from Stathopulos and Felson Duchan)13: (1) individual tailoring, (2) application of exercise types matching the goal of the intervention, (3) progressive overload and (4) sufficient intensity to induce the desired effects of the intervention.""
The exercise intervention involved twice weekly supervised sessions for 48 weeks, which is a greater level of organization and resources than would be typical in usual care. The sessions were also individually tailored and progressively increased in intensity, requiring additional provider expertise.
Score: [2]

Flexibility (delivery):
Quotes: ""The exercise intervention was planned as high-intense aerobic exercise, monitored relative to the patients' individual maximal heart rate (HRmax), and progressed within and between 4 meso cycles of 12 weeks. In brief, the exercise intervention included 3892 minutes of aerobic exercise at an average intensity of 76.2% HRmax.""
The intervention followed a structured protocol in terms of exercise intensity, duration, and progression over time. This allowed less flexibility in delivery compared to usual care.
Score: [2]

Flexibility (adherence):
Quotes: ""The purpose of providing health educational sessions throughout the study period of 48 weeks was primarily to facilitate adherence in the control group, as a previous study showed no effect of health education on MS-related symptoms and a null effect on the outcomes of the present study was therefore expected.14""
The control group received health education sessions to facilitate adherence. No information is provided on if or how adherence was encouraged in the exercise group.

Primary outcome:
Quotes: ""The relapse rate and the global brain atrophy rate were the primary outcomes of this study.""
Relapse rate is a clinically meaningful outcome of importance to MS patients. Global brain atrophy rate is a more surrogate outcome that would not routinely be measured in usual care, but provides insight into the underlying disease process.

Setting:
Quotes: ""Three neurological departments in the Netherlands (University Hospital Groningen, Streekziekenhuis Almelo, Diaconessenhuis Meppel) participated in this study.""
Reasoning: The trial was conducted in three neurological departments in the Netherlands. This likely represents a usual care setting for MS patients. However, with only three centers involved, the setting is somewhat more explanatory than a trial conducted across many centers that would be more representative of usual care.

Follow-up:
Quotes: ""Follow-up lasted one year. In some Kurtzke Functional Systems, the Ambulation Index and the Kurtzke Incapacity Scale a transient greater improvement in the ACTH-treated patients was observed. These superior results in the ACTH group were no longer present at 6 months.""
Reasoning: Follow-up lasted one year, which is likely longer than usual care for an MS relapse. Assessments were done using specific scales like the Kurtzke Functional Systems and Ambulation Index. This represents a more explanatory approach with more extensive data collection than usual care.

Primary outcome:
Quotes: ""To compare the demographic data and treatment results in both groups, the two-sided Mann-Whitney U test was used with exception of the disease stages (RR, PR, and PP) in which we used the Chi-square test.""
Reasoning: The primary outcomes appear to be disease stages and scores on various functional/ambulation scales. While these outcomes are relevant to MS patients, the use of specific scales and categorizations makes the assessment more explanatory than the outcomes likely used in usual care.
Score: [3]

Quotes: ""Only 29 patients entered the trial. The number of patients was much smaller than was hoped for when the study was envisaged. This was due to a changing attitude towards bed rest and the introduction of short term high dose methylprednisolone treatment (9), which rapidly has gained a wide acceptance among neurologists.""
Reasoning: The small sample size and change in usual care during the trial suggests the primary analysis was likely per-protocol rather than intention-to-treat. However, no details are provided on whether the analysis included all randomized participants or only those who completed the protocol. There is insufficient information to fully assess how pragmatic or explanatory the analysis was.
Score: [NA]","Eligibility:
Quotes: ""Only patients with a clinical or laboratory supported definite diagnosis of MS according to the Poser criteria, suffering from a relapse, were included.""
Reasoning: The trial used specific diagnostic criteria (Poser criteria) and only included patients suffering from a relapse of MS. This represents a more explanatory approach, as the eligibility criteria are narrower than what would be used in usual care for all MS patients.

""Adherence to an LTRA was better than it was to the other drugs in both trials, with adherence rates that were numerically higher in the first-line controller therapy trial (65% vs. 41% for an inhaled glucocorticoid) and significantly higher in the add-on therapy trial (74% vs. 46% for a LABA).""
""Although such poor and differential adherence potentially reduces assay sensitivity (particularly when coupled with treatment crossover), thus biasing results toward equivalence, both poor and differential adherence rates are realities of real-world prescribing.""

Adherence was not enforced, and differential adherence between treatment groups was allowed to occur naturally, as would happen in real-world practice. Poor adherence was common but was considered representative of usual care by the authors. No measures to improve adherence are mentioned.

Follow-up:
Quotes:
""Patients who met the eligibility criteria completed a validated asthma-symptom diary28 for 2 weeks before the baseline visit for an assessment of PEF variability and to record current symptoms. After the screening visit (week −2) and baseline visit (week 0), study assessments by telephone or in the clinic were scheduled at months 2, 6, 12, 18, and 24.""

The follow-up schedule involved both remote telephone assessments and in-person clinic visits over 2 years. This is more frequent and extensive than typical follow-up for asthma patients in usual care over this time period. However, the use of telephone visits provides some pragmatic approach compared to only in-person assessments.

Primary outcome:
Quotes:
""The primary outcome measure was the MiniAQLQ score.25,26 Secondary outcome measures included the ACQ score27; the score on the not-yet-validated Royal College of Physicians 3-item asthma questionnaire (RCP3) (range of scores, 0 to 3, with higher scores indicating worse asthma control)30; the score on the validated 14-item Mini Rhino-conjunctivitis Quality of Life Questionnaire (MiniRQLQ) (range of scores, 0 to 6, with higher scores indicating worse rhinitis-related impairment and with an MID of 0.7)31; and the frequency of asthma exacerbations, which were defined as the need for an oral course of glucocorticoids or hospitalization for asthma.""

The primary outcome was the MiniAQLQ, a validated questionnaire assessing asthma-related quality of life. This is a patient-centered outcome that would be relevant to participants. Secondary outcomes included asthma control, rhinitis-related quality of life, and exacerbation frequency, which are also important to patients. The outcome measures are questionnaires that could be used in usual care, not requiring specialized assessment.

Primary analysis:
Quotes:
""The primary effectiveness analysis was an intention-to-treat analysis of the MiniAQLQ score at 2 months (the primary time point) and at 2 years. Analysis of covariance was used, with treatment as a fixed effect and the baseline value as a covariate.""
""The study was powered for equivalence in the MiniAQLQ score, with the equivalence boundary set at a 95% CI of less than 0.3 for the MiniAQLQ score (i.e., equivalence was declared if the 95% CI was wholly included between −0.3 and 0.3). This difference reflects our use of an a priori conservative approach (0.3 is substantially lower than the MID of 0.5 for the MiniAQLQ29) because of uncertainty about its variability in real-world patients.""

The primary analysis was intention-to-treat at the 2-month and 2-year timepoints. This pragmatic approach included all randomized participants. Equivalence testing was used, with a conservative margin pre-specified that was lower than the minimum important difference to account for uncertainty in real-world variability. Some secondary analyses used a per-protocol approach, which is less pragmatic, but the main analysis was intention-to-treat.

Quotes: ""The inclusion criteria were as follows: age > 18, confirmed diagnosis of MS, Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS): 2.0–6.5, Six Spot Step Test (SSST) score > 8 seconds or Timed 25-Foot Walk (T25FW) > 5 seconds, relapse-free within the past 8 weeks, and no adjustment of disease-modifying medication or medication that affects gait performance and spasticity within the past 8 weeks.""
The trial had fairly strict inclusion criteria, including specific age range, disability level, gait impairment measures, and requirements for disease stability and medication use. While not as narrow as some highly explanatory trials, these criteria are more restrictive than what would typically be used in routine care for this patient population.

Recruitment:
Quotes: ""Participants were included from September 2016 to October 2018, after being invited via seven MS clinics (specified in ""Acknowledgements"" section) and targeted advertisements sent out via the Danish MS Society.""
Recruitment was done through a combination of inviting patients from multiple MS clinics and targeted advertisements via the national MS society. This approach, while not as selective as some explanatory trials, is more involved than the usual recruitment that would occur in routine care.

Setting:
Quotes: ""Groups of 3–6 patients were referred to physiotherapy clinics that were randomly assigned to provide either PRT or BMCT or to a waitlist CON. Allocation of interventions was done by a cluster randomization conducted whenever a sufficient number of patients were established at three different participating clinics.""
The trial was conducted at multiple physiotherapy clinics, which is more representative of real-world settings than a single center. However, the cluster randomization by clinic and referral of groups of patients differs from routine care.

Organization:
Quotes: ""The therapists were instructed to aim for a level of difficulty, where the participants experienced failure but still completed successful execution in more than 50% of the attempts/time.""
The interventions required specialized training of the physical therapists and aimed for a specific level of intensity/difficulty. This represents a greater level of expertise and resources than would typically be available in routine care.

Flexibility (delivery):
Quotes: ""The exercises were conducted in machines that targeted the specified muscle groups, but type of machines could vary between centers. All training sessions were supervised by physiotherapists who were trained to deliver the intervention.""
While there was some flexibility in the specific exercise machines used, the interventions followed a defined protocol in terms of muscles targeted, supervision, and progression.

Safety variables monitored also included the percentage of early treatment discontinuation patients who prematurely discontinued from the study due to AEs, as well as the time to withdrawal.""
Reasoning: Safety assessments were conducted at multiple in-clinic visits with measurement of various outcomes like adverse events, vital signs, medications, and labs. This represents a more explanatory approach with more frequent and extensive follow-up than would be expected in usual care.

Primary outcome:
Quotes: ""The CONFIDENCE study was a multinational, multicenter, randomized, parallel-group, phase 4, open-label study conducted at 88 study centers in 14 countries (Russia, Poland, Italy, France, Croatia, US [including Puerto Rico], Spain, Austria, Turkey, Belgium, Argentina, Germany, and Finland) across different geographic regions.""
""The primary endpoint was patient-reported medication satisfaction using the Medication Satisfaction Questionnaire (MSQ).""
Reasoning: The primary outcome of patient-reported medication satisfaction using the MSQ questionnaire is likely relevant and important to patients. However, use of this questionnaire may not be typical in usual care across all the geographic regions in the trial. The outcome assessment has some explanatory elements but is still reasonably pragmatic.

Quotes: ""Patients who perceive their medication to be ineffective or inconvenient are less likely to be adherent to treatment, with potentially significant consequences on long-term clinical outcomes. Many patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) are nonadherent to treatment despite demonstrated efficacy of disease-modifying therapies (DMTs).""
Reasoning: The trial included patients who perceived their medication to be ineffective or inconvenient, which is likely similar to the real-world population of MS patients. However, it's not clear if there were any other exclusion criteria that may have made the trial population differ from those who would receive the intervention as part of usual care.

Quotes: ""The outcome measures for the current research were the scores yielded by the Multiple Sclerosis Self Efficacy (MSSE) survey. For both treatment and control groups, self-efficacy scores were obtained before the first treatment, mid-treatment series, after the last treatment in the series, four weeks after the final treatment and again eight weeks after the final treatment had been received.""
Reasoning: Self-efficacy measured by a validated survey is likely an outcome that is meaningful and relevant to participants. The timing of measurement extends to 8 weeks after treatment which is likely longer than typical follow-up in usual care.
Score: [4]

Primary analysis:
Quotes: ""The data were analyzed on an intention to treat basis, with a focus on the differences between mean MSSE values of the control and intervention groups.""
Reasoning: The use of intention-to-treat analysis is consistent with a pragmatic approach. However, it's not totally clear if all available data was used in the analysis.

Recruitment:
Quotes: ""Individuals were invited consecutively until the allocated number of standing frames (dependent on availability according to usual practice) had been reached.""
Reasoning: Participants were recruited consecutively through usual care organizations until a certain number of standing frames were available. This largely represents a pragmatic approach, as no additional recruitment efforts beyond what would be typical in usual care were employed. However, recruitment was still constrained by the number of available standing frames.

Setting:
Quotes: ""Participants were recruited through eight health-care organisations, including the UK National Health Service (NHS) Trusts, social enterprises, and third sector multiple sclerosis therapy centres, in two regions (Devon–Cornwall and East Anglia) of the UK.""
Reasoning: The trial was conducted across multiple typical care settings for this population, including NHS trusts, social enterprises, and MS therapy centers across two regions of the UK. This represents the same settings in which usual care would be provided.
Score: [5]

Quotes: ""The usual care group was not offered an intervention and hence, we could not exclude that placebo effects might have contributed to the benefits experienced by the standing frame group.""
""The primary outcome was clinician-rated and measured by a masked assessor, which was further enhanced by the masked, self-managed intervention that could be routinely implemented in clinical practice.""
Reasoning: The standing frame intervention did not require additional resources, expertise or organization compared to usual care. The assessments were done by masked assessors which is an enhancement over usual care, but overall the organization closely mirrored a typical clinical setting.

""This allowed for a graduated introduction to standing. At the end of the 20-week period, participants were encouraged to continue to regularly stand, although no further physiotherapy support was provided.""
Reasoning: Participants were given a recommended standing protocol of 30 minutes 3 times per week over 20 weeks, but had flexibility in how they implemented this. They were asked to document their standing in a diary, representing some additional monitoring. After the 20 week period, no further support was provided but participants were encouraged to continue standing regularly.

Reasoning: Participants were asked to record their standing frequency and duration in a daily diary. This allowed monitoring of adherence, but no further measures to enhance or enforce adherence were mentioned. Participants were encouraged to continue standing after the initial 20 week period but this was not enforced. This represents a largely pragmatic approach that is similar to how adherence would be handled in usual care.

Reasoning: Follow-up assessments were conducted at 20 and 36 weeks, which exceeds what would typically be done in usual care. The assessments were done independently away from the participant's home by masked assessors, which also represents an enhancement over usual care follow-up procedures. However, the follow-up intervals of 20 and 36 weeks are not dramatically different from typical care.

Reasoning: The primary outcome was a clinician-rated measure of motor function (AMCA score) at 36 weeks. Motor function is an outcome that is meaningful to patients. The AMCA score requires some clinician expertise to administer that exceeds what is typically available in usual care, but does not represent an overly specialized or esoteric measure.

The primary disability outcomes of EDSS, MSFC, and SLCLA are clinically relevant to MS patients. CDI (confirmed disability improvement) was defined as meaningful EDSS changes maintained over time. These outcomes matter to participants and reflect how they function. Use of the MSFC requires some additional training and may not be routinely used in all MS care settings.

Primary analysis:
Quotes: ""Kaplan-Meier estimates of risk for 6-month CDI with stratification by baseline Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS). Only patients with baseline EDSS ≥2.0 were included in the analysis of CDI; 154 (alemtuzumab, n = 105; subcutaneous interferon-β-1a [SC IFN-β-1a], n = 49) patients were excluded from the analysis for not meeting this criterion.""
The primary analysis used Kaplan-Meier estimates of the risk of achieving 6-month confirmed disability improvement (CDI). Patients with baseline EDSS <2.0 were excluded. While not a fully intention-to-treat approach, the analysis included most randomized patients and estimated a pragmatic outcome. Some exclusions were made for patients with lower baseline disability.

""The members respected and understood the participants' individual qualities and differences, and they stimulated, defied and confronted them to explore and push their boundaries [9].""

The trial used a multidisciplinary team including several specialists (psychiatrist, MS nurse, physiotherapist, dance therapist, person with MS) who were all formally trained and experienced in MS care. This level of expertise and organization is likely beyond what would be consistently available in usual care. The team also made extra efforts to understand and motivate participants that go beyond usual care.

""After having identified and formulated individual stressors and aims, participants sign in for one or more group consultations, during which they verify whether their aims are realizable by asking the members of the multidisciplinary team for aim-related medical information [9].""

The delivery of the social cognitive treatment allowed flexibility to focus on each patient's individual stressors and goals. Participants could sign up for group consultations to get input on their personal aims. This suggests a good degree of flexibility in delivery tailored to each patient. However, the use of the full multidisciplinary team to provide input goes a bit beyond the flexibility likely in usual care.

Primary outcome:
Quotes: ""The primary outcome was peak oxygen consumption (VO2peak) at 12 months; secondary outcomes were composite measures of physical function, fatigue, and health-related quality of life.""
The primary outcome of VO2peak at 12 months is a physiological measure that would not normally be assessed in usual care. The secondary outcomes of physical function, fatigue and quality of life are more relevant to participants.

The primary analysis was done at 12 months on the absolute improvement. A mixed effects model was used to analyze the change in VO2peak. Missing data were imputed with 11 imputations. This represents a fairly pragmatic intention-to-treat approach, using all available data with imputation for missing data.

Flexibility (delivery):
Quotes: ""On Push Days, participants were instructed to do short bursts of moderate-high intensity exercise to their own tolerance (e.g. for 1–3 minutes) and then reduce to a more comfortable pace for 5–7 minutes and repeat as they are possible.""
The MSTEP intervention allowed flexibility in the intensity and duration of exercise bouts based on the participant's tolerance.

Follow-up:
Quotes: ""Patients were then randomized in two groups depending on the treatment strategy: (i) an integrated multidisciplinary (IMD) group, consisting of an IMD approach at the Pitié-Salpêtrière MS clinic, and (ii) a control group, consisting of successive, non-integrated interventions with different specialists and allied health professionals, at different times and sites (Figure 1). For patients in the IMD group, the multidisciplinary integrated outpatient clinic was planned at our MS clinic within a maximum three-month period after inclusion.""
Reasoning: Follow-up in the IMD group occurred within 3 months at the MS clinic. For the control group it occurred over an unspecified timeframe at different times and sites with non-integrated providers. This suggests follow-up was more intensive and structured in the IMD group compared to usual care, but the difference is not drastic.
Score: [3]

Primary outcome:
Quotes: ""The primary outcome was the change in QoL from inclusion to M6, assessed by the Multiple Sclerosis Impact Scale (MSIS-29) self-questionnaire. The MSIS-29 is a validated, reproducible and specific MS QoL scale4–5 that consists of 29 simple questions including eight questions on motor, nine on sensory, cognitive function, urinary and bowel trouble, social, emotional and mobility).""
Reasoning: The primary outcome, quality of life assessed by the MSIS-29, is highly relevant to participants as it captures many important domains impacting the daily lives of MS patients. The questionnaire is validated for MS and appears feasible to administer in usual care.
Score: [4]

Primary analysis:
Quotes: ""For the sample size, calculations were based on a preliminary study,12 including 40 MS patients. In this pilot study a mean improvement of 10 points over six months on the MSIS-29 scale in the IMD group and a mean worsening of six points in the control group was observed. The standard deviation for the change in the MSIS-29 was 14 points. With the same hypotheses, 22 patients per group were necessary to provide the study a power of 90% with a type 1 error rate of 0.05. To take into account a possible dropout rate, we randomized 25 patients per group.""
Reasoning: The primary analysis included all randomized patients (25 per group), indicating an intention-to-treat approach. There is no mention of excluding any participants from the analysis. This pragmatic approach includes all available data.

Quotes: ""0 dyads were lost to follow-up: 4 dyads discontinued intervention - 3 patients died (one after 12-week visit) - 1 withdrew consent (before 12-week visit). 1 dyad did not perform visit 3""
Follow-up appears to be per usual care, with no additional visits except the 12-week withdrawal. 4 dyads discontinued, with 3 patient deaths and 1 withdrawal, which does not seem excessive. Overall follow-up is not considerably more intense than usual care.

Primary outcome:
Quotes: ""The pre-specified primary endpoints were changes in patient quality of life (SEIQoL-DW) and symptom burden (PC Outcome Scale-Symptoms-MS, POS-S-MS).""
The primary outcomes of quality of life and symptom burden are highly relevant to patients. The SEIQoL-DW in particular directly measures patient's quality of life priorities. These outcomes do not seem far removed from what would be collected in routine care.

Quotes: ""A total of 70 adults with MS were recruited in five German centers and randomly allocated to the intervention group (12 weeks of hippotherapy) or the control group.""
Reasoning: The trial was conducted at five centers in one country (Germany). While this is more reflective of usual care than a single center trial, it still may not fully represent the range of settings that MS patients are treated in as part of usual care.
Score: [3]

Organization:
Quotes: ""Hippotherapy as a complementary treatment can be defined as one-patient-one-horse physiotherapy treatment with and on the horse. The primary goals of hippotherapy are regulating muscle tone (reduction in spasticity) and breathing, strengthening the torso muscles, improving balance control and coordination, as well as gait. In addition, hippotherapy promotes social communication in the patients' lives and strengthens their self-esteem.""
Reasoning: The hippotherapy intervention involved specialized training and a one-on-one patient to horse/therapist ratio that likely requires greater resources and expertise than is typically available in usual care. However, hippotherapy is an established complementary therapy for MS, so the organization is not completely foreign to usual care.
Score: [2]

Flexibility (delivery):
Quotes: ""The intervention group received hippotherapy (as defined by the Deutsches Kuratorium für Therapeutisches Reiten e.V. (DKThR))8 once a week for 12 weeks as an add-on therapy to their standard care, which remained unchanged. Patients in the control group continued their previous therapy. Over the study period, symptomatic drug treatment, immunotherapy, and physiotherapy were kept unchanged in both groups.""
Reasoning: The intervention followed a defined protocol of 12 weekly hippotherapy sessions, but allowed participants' standard care to continue unchanged. This represents a moderate level of flexibility in delivery compared to usual care.
Score: [3]

Flexibility (adherence):
Quotes: No relevant quotes identified. 
Reasoning: The study does not report any information on measures taken to monitor or enforce participant adherence to the hippotherapy intervention. Adherence flexibility cannot be assessed based on the details provided.
Score: [NA]

Follow-up:
Quotes: ""Examinations and questionnaires were completed prior to the first hippotherapy session (baseline), after 6–7 weeks (interim assessment) and after 12 weeks (final assessment). Physiotherapists who assessed the endpoints in a separate room were blinded and explicitly trained not to question patients or hippotherapists. Patients were individually instructed to keep confidentiality of their allocation group.""
Reasoning: Participants underwent an assessment at baseline, 6-7 weeks, and 12 weeks. This is more intensive follow-up than would be typical in usual care. Physiotherapists performing the assessments were also blinded which differs from usual care.
Score: [2]

Primary outcome:
Quotes: ""Under study conditions and within 12 weeks, BBS improved in both groups. In the intervention group, the change in BBS from baseline to week 12 was 6.00 points (95% CI: 4.2–7.8) versus 2.9 in the control group (95% CI: 1.5–4.4, derived from MMRM) (Table 2 and supplementary figure e-1). The mean difference in change from baseline between groups at 12 weeks was 3.07 points (95% CI: 1.00–5.14, p=0.004 (Table 2, MMRM)).""
Reasoning: The primary outcome was change in Berg Balance Scale from baseline to 12 weeks. This is a patient-relevant outcome that assesses balance, an important symptom for MS patients. The Berg Balance Scale is a standard, well-established measure that would likely be used in usual care as well.
Score: [4]

Primary analysis:
Quotes: ""Analyses were based on the modified intention-to-treat set (modified ITT). This set encompasses all randomized patients with valid baseline assessment. The primary endpoint change of BBS from baseline to 12 weeks was calculated using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) with the fixed effects group, center, age, gender, EDSS classification, and baseline BBS (type 2 sums of squares). Missing values were imputed through the last observation carried forward (LOCF) value.""
Reasoning: The primary analysis was conducted on a modified intention-to-treat population that included all randomized participants with a valid baseline measurement. Missing data was handled using last observation carried forward. While not as rigorous as a full intention-to-treat analysis, this represents a reasonable compromise between pragmatic and explanatory approaches.

The trial recruited overweight/obese male hockey fans from two specific teams in Ontario. While this represents the population of interest, the eligibility criteria are more restrictive than what would be used in usual care, as they focus on a specific demographic group. The sample size calculation also assumes a fairly high retention rate.

Differences in characteristics between experimental and control groups were tested statistically using an unpaired independent group t-test and the Chi-squared test. The group (intervention) × time interaction from a repeated measures analysis of variance was used to measure whether or not the effect of intervention was statistically significant for variables that followed an approximate normal distribution (logarithm transformation was applied to the variable one plus self-reported physical exercise (IPAQ) to achieve normality).""

The primary analysis was a per-protocol analysis, not intention-to-treat. Patients who dropped out or did not adhere to the intervention were excluded. This approach is less pragmatic than an ITT approach including all randomized participants.

The trial recruited a broad population of asthma patients from general practices, with the main eligibility criteria being adults on the asthma register who had requested a bronchodilator in the past 6 months. This is a fairly pragmatic approach, as it includes a population similar to those who would receive the intervention as part of usual care. However, the requirement for a recent bronchodilator request adds an additional criterion that makes it somewhat less pragmatic than using just the asthma register alone.

Patients were recruited from the practices' asthma registers, which is how they would be identified for reviews in usual care. However, they were then randomized to the telephone or face-to-face consultation arms, which differs from usual care where patients would not be randomized.

Flexibility (Delivery):
Quotes: ""Fracture fixation or humeral head replacement were performed by surgeons experienced in these techniques. Nonsurgical treatment was sling immobilization. Standardized outpatient and community-based rehabilitation was provided to both groups.""
Reasoning: The delivery of surgical and nonsurgical interventions is described in broad terms, without mentioning specific protocols, monitoring procedures, or restrictions on co-interventions that would differ from usual care. Surgeons used techniques they were already experienced in. Standardized rehabilitation was provided but not described in detail. This suggests flexibility in intervention delivery was similar to usual care.
Score: [4]

Flexibility (Adherence):
Quotes: No relevant quotes identified. The study does not discuss participant adherence to the assigned treatments.
Reasoning: There is insufficient information provided to assess how participant adherence was monitored or encouraged compared to usual care. Surgical interventions took place in the hospital, while nonsurgical treatment was sling immobilization, but adherence is not explicitly discussed.

Follow-up:
Quotes: ""The data for 231 patients (114 in surgical group and 117 in nonsurgical group) were included in the primary analysis.""
""Valid OSS responses were recorded for 232 patients (93%) at 6 months, 225 (90%) at 12 months, and 215 (86%) at 24 months,""
Reasoning: Follow-up assessments were conducted at 6, 12, and 24 months, with retention rates of 93%, 90%, and 86% at those time points. This follow-up schedule is likely somewhat more frequent and intense than what would occur in usual care after proximal humerus fracture. However, the timing of assessments at 6 month intervals is not excessively burdensome.

Primary Outcome:
Quotes: ""Primary outcome was the Oxford Shoulder Score (OSS), which is a shoulder-specific outcome measure validated in a UK population.12 The OSS provides a total score based on the patient's subjective assessment of pain and function. It contains 12 items, each with 5 categories of response, and a range of total scores of 0 (worst outcome) to 48 (best outcome).13 The OSS was collected by postal questionnaires at 6, 12, and 24 months.""
Reasoning: The Oxford Shoulder Score is a validated, patient-reported outcome measure assessing shoulder pain and function. It is likely relevant to patients with proximal humerus fractures. Collecting the outcome via postal questionnaires at 6, 12 and 24 months is a pragmatic approach that does not require additional clinic visits. No adjudication of outcomes is mentioned.

Primary Analysis:
Quotes: ""The primary analysis compared OSS data over 2 years (at 6, 12, and 24 months) using a mixed-effect model with an unstructured covariance pattern. Missing outcome data were predicted by age, sex, and health status at baseline (EuroQol 5D). An unstructured covariance pattern was selected for the repeated measurements as the least restrictive structure, which resulted in better model fit based on log-likelihood values than more constrained patterns. Estimates of the difference in OSS between treatment groups were assessed overall and at individual time points.""
""Of 1250 patients screened, 563 (45%) were eligible and 687 (55%) were ineligible (Figure 1). The most common reason for exclusion (>1 reason per patient possible) was that a patient had co-morbidities that precluded surgery or anesthetic. Of the 563 eligible patients, 250 (44%) consented to take part in the trial (Figure 1). These patients were randomized to surgical or nonsurgical treatment between September 2008 and April 2011.""
Reasoning: The primary analysis used a mixed-effects model to compare OSS scores between groups over 2 years, accounting for missing data using age, sex and baseline health status. This represents an intention-to-treat approach including all randomized participants. 250 out of 563 eligible patients (44%) consented and were included, which is a fairly high participation rate. Some ineligible patients were excluded due to comorbidities precluding surgery or anesthesia, but the eligible patients were randomized.

Reasoning: The eligibility criteria are quite broad, including adults aged 16 years or older who sustained a displaced proximal humerus fracture involving the surgical neck within 3 weeks. The mean age of 66 years, with 77% being female and 99.6% being white, suggests the study population is representative of the typical patient population for this condition. No additional exclusion criteria are mentioned that would make the study population differ from those treated in usual care.

The trial recruited participants from primary care practices with assistance from research networks. The eligibility criteria were fairly broad, including community-dwelling older adults who were independently mobile and physically able to participate in group exercise. However, there were some exclusions that differ from usual care, such as those with ≥3 falls in the previous year, unstable clinical conditions, inability to follow exercise instructions, or receiving palliative care. These criteria are somewhat more restrictive than the general older adult population seen in usual care.
