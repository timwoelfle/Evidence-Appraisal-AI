P24. Discussion / Summary of evidence: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎The present review illustrates that there is an extreme paucity of studies to address in an evidence-based manner many of the common issues related to the primary repair of proximal hypospadias.&quot;</span> [Yes]
P25. Discussion / Limitations: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎An important limitation is that this review did not account for some variables such as age at surgery, use of additional coverage of urethroplasty, and type of preoperative and postoperative drainage and care.&quot;</span> [Yes]
P26. Discussion / Conclusions: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎This systematic review demonstrates the weak evidence supporting current management of primary severe hyposapdias.&quot;</span> [Yes]

P1. Title: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎Does Preputial Reconstruction Increase Complication Rate of Hypospadias Repair? 20-Year Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis&quot;</span>
[Yes] The report is identified as a systematic review and meta-analysis.

P2. Abstract / Structured summary: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎We performed a systematic review of the literature on preputial reconstruction (PR) during hypospadias repair to determine the cumulative risk of preputial skin complications and the influence of PR on urethroplasty complications, namely, fistula formation and overall reoperation rate of the repair.&quot;</span>
[Yes] The abstract provides a structured summary including background, objectives, and key findings.

P3. Introduction / Rationale: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎Preputial asymmetry is one of the components of hypospadias. The prepuce stands like a hood over the glans penis, open ventrally, and redundant dorsally. Preputial reconstruction (PR) is an option during hypospadias repair, but many surgeons favor circumcision for the concern that PR might increase the complication rate of hypospadias repair.&quot;</span>
[Yes] The rationale for the review is described in the context of what is already known.

P4. Introduction / Objectives: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎We performed a systematic review of the literature on PR during hypospadias repair to determine the cumulative risk of specific complications related to the procedure. Moreover, we performed a meta-analysis of studies comparing urethroplasty complications and reoperation rates in patients undergoing hypospadias repair associated with PR vs. circumcision.&quot;</span>

A Systematic Review in Search of the Evidence&quot;</span>
[Yes]

P2. Abstract / Structured summary: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎Objective: (1) Is screening of intestinal rotational anatomy obligatory in “asymptomatic” patients with heterotaxy? (2) Does detection of an anomaly warrant surgical correction?&quot;</span>
[Yes]

P3. Introduction / Rationale: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎Heterotaxy is an abnormal arrangement of thoraco-abdominal viscera across a left-to-right axis. Intestinal rotational anomalies are frequent among patients with heterotaxy, but debate exists as to whether they are benign in nature, requiring careful observation alone, or if surgical correction is warranted to prevent obstruction or midgut volvulus.&quot;</span>
[Yes]

P4. Introduction / Objectives: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎we undertook a systematic review of the available literature to determine (1) whether screening of IRA is obligatory in “asymptomatic” patients with heterotaxy and (2) whether detection of a rotational anomaly warrant(s) surgical correction in such a fragile patient cohort.&quot;</span>
[Yes]

P5. Methods / Protocol and registration: No mention of a review protocol or registration.
[No]

P6. Methods / Eligibility criteria: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎Eligibility criteria were then applied to remaining studies&quot;</span>
[Yes]

P7. Methods / Information sources: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎A systematic search of the English language literature was conducted using a keyword algorithm (Supplemental Figure 1, https://links.lww.com/SLA/A928). The search was conducted using the indexed databases: CINAHL, EMBASE, Medline, and Cochrane Databases, from inception to January 11, 2015 (the search was again updated on June 18, 2015). Additional articles were identified through the reference listings of those articles yielded through the initial electronic database search. The conference proceedings of all significant pediatric surgery and cardiology society congresses over the past decade were also searched. Finally, data regarding patients with heterotaxy from our own institution were also obtained.&quot;</span>

P24. Discussion / Summary of evidence: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎Our study suggests that LS is a feasible, safe, and effective surgical procedure alternative to OS for pediatric patients. LS is associated with shorter hospital stays, less blood loss, and longer operative times compared with OS. Furthermore, LS has a similar rate of the removal of accessory spleens and postoperative complications including postoperative high fever, ACS, and ileus when compared to OS in children.&quot;</span>
[Yes]

P25. Discussion / Limitations: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎Our systematic review and meta-analysis have several limitations. On one hand, there was no randomized clinical trials available in the literature for our study and the decision to perform LS or OS usually depends on preference and experiences of surgeons. Besides, some of the included studies had rather small sample size. On the other hand, obvious statistical heterogeneity was detected among different trials in terms of operative time, blood loss, and length of hospital stay.&quot;</span>

P3. Introduction / Rationale: <span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 99.2%):

n Pull-through (PT) operations for Hirschsprung’s disease (HD) generally result in a satisfactory outcome [1]. However, some patients after definitive PT operation have disturbances of bowel function such as constipation, enterocolitis and recurrent obstructive symptoms [2–9]. In the majority of these patients, residual bowel problems can be managed by non-surgical treatment such as laxatives, enemas or intrasphincteric botulinum toxin injection [10–12]. In a few patients, persistent abdominal distension, constipation or enterocolitis is due to postoperative stricture or retained aganglionic segment which may require a redo PT operation [13–17].

Discussion / Summary of evidence: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎We found that children who were managed by specialized pediatric surgery teams had lower rates of negative appendicectomy although mean length of stay was longer.&quot;</span> [Yes]
P25. Discussion / Limitations: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎Our article is based upon a group of heterogeneous and mostly retrospective studies, and therefore there is little external validity.&quot;</span> [Yes]
P26. Discussion / Conclusions: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎We wish to encourage future research through the use of large-scale prospective multicenter registries.&quot;</span> [Yes]

P25. Discussion / Limitations: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎The first limitation is that all of the reviewed studies were retrospective studies and the results were not recorded in a uniform manner to allow the data to be meta-analysed. Second, the numbers involved in these studies were small and this may skew the results, as the authors may be reporting on their initial experiences.&quot;</span> [Yes]
P26. Discussion / Conclusions: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎The present review shows that, despite the small numbers studied, FURSL in the management of renal calculi in the paediatric population is an effective and safe procedure in high-volume centres.&quot;</span> [Yes]

2. Reasoning: The title clearly identifies the report as a systematic literature review.
3. Response: [Yes]

P2. Abstract / Structured summary: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎Circumcision can be undertaken using a variety of techniques. For the technique to be successful, it should be easy to perform, avoid excessive haemorrhage and achieve a good cosmetic and functional result with minimal postoperative care. Naturally, there are differences between circumcision in the paediatric and adult populations and here we review the literature on recent advances that have been made in paediatric circumcision and the use of a sutureless technique with tissue glue for wound approximation.&quot;</span>

P3. Introduction / Rationale: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎Circumcision is one of the most commonly performed operations [1], with various recognised techniques. Procedures include the Plastibell with ligature [2] and excision with or without suturing. Absorbable sutures have traditionally been used to approximate the skin edges. The disadvantage of this method of wound approximation, however, is in the postoperative appearance, with the formation of small granulomata and the persistence of stitch marks along suture line [3].&quot;</span>

Discussion / Summary of evidence: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎This meta-analysis of methodologically limited comparative studies indicates neonatal thoracoscopic CDH repair has increased recurrence risk and operative time compared with open repair: although survival and patch usage appear comparable, such similarities may be subject to type 2 error as well as biases.&quot;</span>
[Yes]

P25. Discussion / Limitations: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎The analyzed studies report small numbers of cases and are therefore vulnerable to type 2 error (failure to detect a real difference).&quot;</span>
[Yes]

P26. Discussion / Conclusions: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎Better quality evidence is therefore required. Systematic reviews and meta-analyses frequently conclude with calls for more randomized controlled trials (RCTs). In contrast, we call for prospective, comprehensive, multi-institutional registry data on neonatal endosurgical CDH repair.&quot;</span>

2. The title clearly identifies the report as a systematic review and meta-analysis.
[Yes]

P2. Abstract / Structured summary: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎The aim of this study was to explore the true efficacy and potential advantages of lymphatic sparing laparoscopic varicocelectomy (LSV) over lymphatic non-sparing laparoscopic varicocelectomy (LNSV) in children and adolescents.&quot;</span>
3. The abstract provides a structured summary including background, objectives, and study eligibility criteria.
[Yes]

P3. Introduction / Rationale: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎Varicocele, an abnormal tortuosity and dilatation of the testicular vein within the spermatic cord, first develops in childhood or early adolescence. The prevalence of varicocele in adolescent boys is estimated to be 11–15%. It has been established that adolescent varicocele is associated with growth retardation of the ipsilateral testicle and impaired testicular function, which is correlated to the duration of the varicocele. Although some studies have challenged the role varicocele plays in infertility, many studies have stated that varicocele is associated with testicular atrophy and abnormal seminal parameters contributing to male infertility. Surgical management of adolescent varicocele has been advocated to preserve future fertility. The earlier the patient undergoes varicocele repair, the more likely the testis will recover from a varicocele-induced injury. Currently, several techniques are successfully used for varicocelectomy including open surgical ligation via a subinguinal, inguinal or retroperitoneal approach, and microsurgical and laparoscopic procedures. However, the efficacy of surgical procedures and the outcomes in boys and young adolescents remains unclear.&quot;</span>

There are limitations to this review which must be considered. First, there have only been a small number of studies comparing LPE with OPE in the treatment of biliary atresia, with a lack of randomized trials. Second, the sample size of some selected studies is small so that the statistical power to detect the difference in the outcomes is limited. Third, although most of the comparative cohort studies seem to be robust, risk of selection bias still existed, as it was the surgeons’ preference and experience that determined the allocation of patients to either LPE or OPE group. Fourth, marked heterogeneity for several meta-analysis, short follow-up time in some included studies, and the potentially existed significant risk of publication bias may more or less affect the accuracy of the results.

[Yes]

P2. Abstract / Structured summary: <span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 99.8%):

Background Excision has been established as a standard management practice for choledochal cysts in the last few decades. The two most commonly performed methods of reconstruction after excision are hepaticoduodenostomy (HD) and Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy (HJ), of which the HJ is favored by most surgeons. Evidence concerning the optimal method of reconstruction is, however, sparse. Materials and Methods Studies comparing outcomes from HD and HJ after choledochal cyst excision were identified by searching Medline, Ovid, Search Medica, Elsevier Clinicalkey, Google Scholar and Cochrane library. Suitable studies were chosen and data extracted for meta-analysis. Outcomes evaluated included operative time, hospital stay and incidence of postoperative bile leak, cholangitis, reflux/gastritis, anastomotic stricture, bleeding, intestinal obstruction and re-operative rate. Pooled odds ratios (OR) were calculated for dichotomous variables; pooled mean differences (MD) were measured for continuous variables. Results Six retrospective studies were included in this meta-analysis, comprising a total of 679 patients, 412 of whom (60.7%) underwent HD, and the remainder, 267(39.3%) underwent HJ. Although, HD group had slightly shorter hospital stay (MD: 0.30; 95% CI: −0.22–0.39; P < 0.00001) it showed a higher incidence of postoperative reflux/gastritis (OR: 0.08; 95% CI: − 0.02–0.39; P = 0.002). However, the other outcomes such as bile leak, cholangitis, anastomotic stricture, bleeding, operative time, reoperation rate and adhesive intestinal obstruction did not differ between HD and HJ groups. Conclusions HD shows higher postoperative reflux/gastritis than HJ but a shorter hospital stay. There are few good-quality studies that compare the outcomes from HD and HJ, meaning that caution should be exercised in the generalization of the results of this meta-analysis, which suggests HD to be comparable with HJ in terms of other complications, operative benefits and outcomes.' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;‎Background: Excision has been established as a standard management practice for choledochal cysts in the last few decades.

Discussion / Summary of evidence: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎In our systematic review of high-level evidence, LP was found to be superior to OP with respect to a shorter time to full feed but not regarding (major) postoperative complications or length of hospital stay.&quot;</span>
[Yes]

P25. Discussion / Limitations: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎There are still contradictory results in the literature with regard to the benefits and disadvantages of LP compared to the open procedure to treat infants with HPS.&quot;</span>
[Yes]

P26. Discussion / Conclusions: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎In this systematic review we summarized all RCTs available in the pediatric surgical literature, focusing mainly on major complications that need surgical reintervention in patients with HPS. However, our results show no clear benefit of the laparoscopic procedure over the open operation.&quot;</span>
[Yes]

P27. Funding: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎Dr. M. W. N. Oomen, Dr. L. T.

al. This meta-analysis has some limitations that should be taken into account when considering the results. First, there are no randomized trials comparing the two procedures. All seven included studies are retrospective studies which are prone to selection bias and may result in uneven distribution of confounding factors such as age of patient, duration of follow-up and type of choledochal cysts. Second, except one study [14], the others did not compare outcomes between the laparoscopic and open group within the same study period, the main drawback in drawing conclusions from different study period is that factors other than the surgical approach, such as changes in perioperative practices or improved equipment, may introduce bias. Third, in some studies, the number of patients was too small, leading to low-power analyses. Caution should be given in the interpretation and generalization of this meta-analysis as the included study numbers are not high and also the overall quantity of these studies is insufficient. At last, heterogeneity among the studies is' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;‎This meta-analysis has some limitations that should be taken into account when considering the results.

P2. Abstract / Structured summary: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎We performed a retrospective review of all children with intussusception who required operative reduction at our institution over a 12-year time period. We also performed a meta-analysis to combine our data with the published literature.&quot;</span>
[Yes]

P3. Introduction / Rationale: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎Controversy exists as to whether the laparoscopic (LAP) operative approach is as safe and effective as the standard open approach.&quot;</span>
[Yes]

P4. Introduction / Objectives: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎We aimed to retrospectively review our institution's experience with the surgical treatment of intussusception, comparing the LAP and open approaches.

Methods / Eligibility criteria: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or controlled clinical trials (CCTs) comparing MIS to open surgery for the treatment of solid intra‐thoracic or intra‐abdominal neoplasms in children (aged 0 to 18 years) were considered for inclusion.&quot;</span> [Yes]
P7. Methods / Information sources: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎We searched CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library 2014, Issue 1), MEDLINE/PubMed (from 1966 to February 2014) and EMBASE/Ovid (from 1980 to February 2014) to identify relevant studies.&quot;</span> [Yes]

Our meta-analysis revealed a significantly lower rate of post-operative death in the MIS group than in the open techniques group with an RR of 0.26 (95 % CI 0.10–0.68; p = 0.006) (Fig. 2). The incidence of hernia recurrence was greater in the MIS group with an RR of 3.42 (95 % CI 1.98–5.88; p < 0.00001) (Fig. 3). The previous two sets of pooled data both showed good homogeneity among the involved trials. Thus, fixed models were applied for analysis. No significant difference was found for the rates of prosthetic patch use between the two groups (Fig. 4).

Discussion / Limitations: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎All the trials included are susceptible to the limitations of any retrospective review. They all have selection bias, and the numbers of patients are all small to draw a definitive conclusion.&quot;</span>
[Yes] Limitations at study and outcome level, as well as review-level, are discussed.

P26. Discussion / Conclusions: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;‎MIS for CDH repair is associated with lower post-operative mortality and morbidity compared with traditional open surgery. Although the rate of patch use appears to be comparable, the increased risk of recurrence of CDH should not be ignored. The lack of well-controlled prospective clinical trials might also be a reason for the inability to find significant predictive factors.&quot;</span>

The two most commonly performed methods of reconstruction after excision are hepaticoduodenostomy (HD) and Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy (HJ), of which the HJ is favored by most surgeons. Evidence concerning the optimal method of reconstruction is, however, sparse. Materials and Methods Studies comparing outcomes from HD and HJ after choledochal cyst excision were identified by searching Medline, Ovid, Search Medica, Elsevier Clinicalkey, Google Scholar and Cochrane library. Suitable studies were chosen and data extracted for meta-analysis. Outcomes evaluated included operative time, hospital stay and incidence of postoperative bile leak, cholangitis, reflux/gastritis, anastomotic stricture, bleeding, intestinal obstruction and re-operative rate. Pooled odds ratios (OR) were calculated for dichotomous variables; pooled mean differences (MD) were measured for continuous variables. Results Six retrospective studies were included in this meta-analysis, comprising a total of 679 patients, 412 of whom (60.7%) underwent HD, and the remainder, 267(39.3%) underwent HJ. Although, HD group had slightly shorter hospital stay (MD: 0.30; 95% CI: −0.22–0.39; P < 0.00001) it showed a higher incidence of postoperative reflux/gastritis (OR: 0.08; 95% CI: − 0.02–0.39; P = 0.002).

Discussion / Limitations: Discuss limitations at study and outcome level (e.g., risk of bias), and at review-level (e.g., incomplete retrieval of identified research, reporting bias).\nExtracted quote: 'There are several limitations inherent in this meta-analysis. First, we identified the following three major variations in study design: 1) manner of selection of gastroschisis closure method, 2) inclusion of patients receiving surgically sutured silos in the silo group, and 3) inclusion of patients with complicated gastroschisis (including atresia, volvulus, and perforation).'\nReasoning: The limitations of the meta-analysis are discussed, including variations in study design and potential biases.\n\nP26. Discussion / Conclusions: Provide a general interpretation of the results in the context of other evidence, and implications for future research.\nExtracted quote: 'This analysis highlights the heterogeneity of the available literature on closure methods for gastroschisis and the impact of study design on reported outcomes. Determining a superior method of closure would be a benefit to both the surgical and medical management of gastroschisis; this meta-analysis demonstrates that further well-designed studies are needed to gain an accurate picture of outcomes after different surgical interventions.'\nReasoning: The general interpretation of the results is provided, emphasizing the need for further well-designed studies to determine the best closure method for gastroschisis.\n\nP27.
