P24. Discussion / Summary of evidence: ""In conclusion, sutureless circumcision in children appears to have significant advantages to the standard closure using interrupted sutures. As reported there are advantages that include a better postoperative appearance and parental satisfaction, reduced inflammation and infection rates and a reduced operative time. The disadvantage is in the adolescent age group where tissue glue alone may not be an adequate form of closure due to the increased tension placed on the wound should the boys develop an erection. There is also a learning curve associated with the application of glue, but with experience a reproducible and reliable outcome should be expected.""

P3. Introduction / Rationale: ""Varicocele, an abnormal tortuosity and dilatation of the testicular vein within the spermatic cord, first develops in childhood or early adolescence. The prevalence of varicocele in adolescent boys is estimated to be 11–15%. It has been established that adolescent varicocele is associated with growth retardation of the ipsilateral testicle and impaired testicular function, which is correlated to the duration of the varicocele. Although some studies have challenged the role varicocele plays in infertility, many studies have stated that varicocele is associated with testicular atrophy and abnormal seminal parameters contributing to male infertility. Surgical management of adolescent varicocele has been advocated to preserve future fertility. The earlier the patient undergoes varicocele repair, the more likely the testis will recover from a varicocele-induced injury. Currently, several techniques are successfully used for varicocelectomy including open surgical ligation via a subinguinal, inguinal or retroperitoneal approach, and microsurgical and laparoscopic procedures. However, the efficacy of surgical procedures and the outcomes in boys and young adolescents remains unclear.""

P3. Introduction / Rationale: ""Varicocele, an abnormal tortuosity and dilatation of the testicular vein within the spermatic cord, first develops in childhood or early adolescence. The prevalence of varicocele in adolescent boys is estimated to be 11–15%. It has been established that adolescent varicocele is associated with growth retardation of the ipsilateral testicle and impaired testicular function, which is correlated to the duration of the varicocele. Although some studies have challenged the role varicocele plays in infertility, many studies have stated that varicocele is associated with testicular atrophy and abnormal seminal parameters contributing to male infertility. Surgical management of adolescent varicocele has been advocated to preserve future fertility. The earlier the patient undergoes varicocele repair, the more likely the testis will recover from a varicocele-induced injury. Currently, several techniques are successfully used for varicocelectomy including open surgical ligation via a subinguinal, inguinal or retroperitoneal approach, and microsurgical and laparoscopic procedures. However, the efficacy of surgical procedures and the outcomes in boys and young adolescents remains unclear.""

P2. Abstract / Structured summary: ""Background: Excision has been established as a standard management practice for choledochal cysts in the last few decades. The two most commonly performed methods of reconstruction after excision are hepaticoduodenostomy (HD) and Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy (HJ), of which the HJ is favored by most surgeons.

Methods: Studies comparing outcomes from HD and HJ after choledochal cyst excision were identified by searching Medline, Ovid, Search Medica, Elsevier Clinicalkey, Google Scholar and Cochrane library. Suitable studies were chosen and data extracted for meta-analysis. Results: Six retrospective studies were included in this meta-analysis, comprising a total of 679 patients, 412 of whom (60.7%) underwent HD, and the remainder, 267(39.3%) underwent HJ. Although, HD group had slightly shorter hospital stay (MD: 0.30; 95% CI: −0.22–0.39; P < 0.00001) it showed a higher incidence of postoperative reflux/gastritis (OR: 0.08; 95% CI: − 0.02–0.39; P = 0.002). However, the other outcomes such as bile leak, cholangitis, anastomotic stricture, bleeding, operative time, reoperation rate and adhesive intestinal obstruction did not differ between HD and HJ groups. Conclusions: HD shows higher postoperative reflux/gastritis than HJ but a shorter hospital stay. There are few good-quality studies that compare the outcomes from HD and HJ, meaning that caution should be exercised in the generalization of the results of this meta-analysis, which suggests HD to be comparable with HJ in terms of other complications, operative benefits and outcomes.""

Suitable studies were chosen and data extracted for meta-analysis. Results: Six retrospective studies were included in this meta-analysis, comprising a total of 679 patients, 412 of whom (60.7%) underwent HD, and the remainder, 267(39.3%) underwent HJ. Although, HD group had slightly shorter hospital stay (MD: 0.30; 95% CI: −0.22–0.39; P < 0.00001) it showed a higher incidence of postoperative reflux/gastritis (OR: 0.08; 95% CI: − 0.02–0.39; P = 0.002). However, the other outcomes such as bile leak, cholangitis, anastomotic stricture, bleeding, operative time, reoperation rate and adhesive intestinal obstruction did not differ between HD and HJ groups. Conclusions: HD shows higher postoperative reflux/gastritis than HJ but a shorter hospital stay. There are few good-quality studies that compare the outcomes from HD and HJ, meaning that caution should be exercised in the generalization of the results of this meta-analysis, which suggests HD to be comparable with HJ in terms of other complications, operative benefits and outcomes.""

Discussion / Summary of evidence: ""The present meta-analysis has shown that the lowest complication rates for the TIP repair are when it is applied to primary distal hypospadias; Lower complication rates than those reported in this TIP review have been documented in some studies using a staged repair for correction of primary proximal or secondary hypospadias, implying that a staged approach may be superior to the TIP repair in these settings.""
[Yes]

P25. Discussion / Limitations: ""Documentation of follow-up duration was limited, making assessment of the impact of length of follow-up difficult; Geographical location had a noticeable effect on outcome, with all but one complication being lower in the North American than the other groups; Additional long-term follow-up papers are required to further evaluate this popular hypospadias technique that has now been in use for 18 years.""

[Yes] The abstract provides a structured summary including background, objectives, and key findings.

P3. Introduction / Rationale: ""Preputial asymmetry is one of the components of hypospadias. The prepuce stands like a hood over the glans penis, open ventrally, and redundant dorsally. Preputial reconstruction (PR) is an option during hypospadias repair, but many surgeons favor circumcision for the concern that PR might increase the complication rate of hypospadias repair.""
