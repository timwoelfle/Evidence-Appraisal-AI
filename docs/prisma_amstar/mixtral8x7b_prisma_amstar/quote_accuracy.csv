116,PRISMA,"Introduction: Biliary atresia (BA) is one of the most common reasons for portoenterostomy in pediatric surgery, which is characterized by progressive inflammatory disease of the hepatobiliary system that occurs in about 1/9,000–1/15,000 neonates. The main clinical manifestations of BA include pale acholic stools, dark urine and conjugated jaundice, and may eventually lead to malignant transformations. The etiology of BA remains unknown, but several assumptions have been reported, including congenital or acquired immune disorders, perinatal virus infection, the inherited pathogenic factor hypothesis, ductal plate malformation and maternal microchimerisms of the liver which may cause the graft-vs-host reaction. Since first reported by Kasai and Suzuki in 1959, portoenterostomy (PE) remains the mainstay of treating BA. Although early prompt surgical treatment was performed to improve biliary drainage, liver transplantation is still needed in more than 50 % of all patients with BA. Postoperative complications, caused by operative injure, include pain, prolonged ileus, hernias and wound dehiscence. As the rapid development of minimally invasive technique, attempts were made to perform PE using laparoscopy, and the first laparoscopic portoenterostomy (LPE) was performed by Esteves et al. in 2002. During the past several years, the less invasive LPE has been practiced in many centers with the obvious advantage of excellent visualization, less pain and it does not affect the appearance of the skin following the surgery, compared with open portoenterostomy (OPE). Despite the appeal of laparoscopic portoenterostomy, requiring advanced laparoscopic skills, LPE remains a challenging procedure. In addition, several studies have also reported the concerns towards LPE requiring longer duration of operation, needing extensive learning curve for pediatric surgeons, particularly junior pediatric trainees and cost implications of the procedure. Owing to the relative low incidence of BA and technique difficulty, only limited reports on LPE, compared with OPE, were published. Thus, we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to review the currently available data comparing laparoscopic portoenterostomy (LPE) versus open portoenterostomy (OPE) for the treatment of biliary atresia (BA).",fulltext,"Introduction Biliary atresia (BA) is one of the most common reasons for portoenterostomy in pediatric surgery, which is characterized by progressive inflammatory disease of the hepatobiliary system that occurs in about 1/9,000–1/15,000 neonates [1].

The purpose of this study is to critically evaluate the existing literature on this topic and to compare the Foker technique to the more conventional delayed primary anastomosis. Methods: A systematic review and cumulative meta-analysis was performed, including all articles describing the Foker technique or delayed primary anastomosis. Primary outcome was complications, and secondary outcome was time to final anastomosis. Results: Six articles on the Foker procedure met the criteria for inclusion. None were prospective or randomized. These articles represented 71 infants undergoing the Foker procedure, which were compared with 451 children from 44 studies utilizing delayed primary anastomosis. The Foker procedure was associated with a significantly lower risk of complications (leak, stricture, and gastroesophageal reflux), and with a significantly shorter time to definitive anastomosis.

According to the International Society for Nomenclature of Paediatric and Congenital Heart Disease, heterotaxy is a spectrum of disorders with many variations in the way internal organs are lateralized, hence the term situs ambiguus, because it does not include situs solitus (normal intra-abdominal anatomy) or situs inversus (complete mirror-image of the intra-abdominal anatomy). Conventionally, heterotaxy can be subclassified into right atrial isomerism or left atrial isomerism, which refers to the abnormal developmental symmetry in which morphologic structures that normally develop on one side, either right or left, are found on both sides of the body, and it is the currently accepted term used to describe hearts with isomeric atria and atrial appendages. Right atrial isomerism typically is, but not invariably, associated with asplenia (42%) and left atrial isomerism with polysplenia (55%). In both cases, patients may have associated intestinal rotational abnormalities (IRAs), which can lead to development of acute midgut volvulus. Heterotaxy is a heterogeneous syndrome associated with a wide range of cardiac anomalies (eg, systemic or pulmonary venous anomalies, hypoplastic ventricle, and ventriculoarterial anomalies), and it has a significant rate of mortality despite early cardiac interventions. The mortality to discharge has been reported to be 4.2% after systemic-to-pulmonary shunt and 10.8% after Fontan procedure, which are significantly greater compared with any other nonheterotaxy congenital heart diseases.

Inclusion criteria included: primary hypospadias repair only; both including the PBF and TIP techniques; at least one of the quantitative outcomes obtainable from study; comparative studies.

167,PRISMA,"Abstract Purpose: Laparoscopic herniorrhaphy (LH) has been evolved as a minimally invasive technique for pediatric inguinal hernias (PIHs). Considerable debate exists regarding the benefits of LH over conventional open herniorrhaphy (OH). The aim of this review was to critique the current literature to determine the efficacy of LH. Methods: Published studies until July 30, 2010, were searched from Medline, Embase, Ovid, Web of Science, and Cochrane databases. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and observational clinical studies (OCSs) with a comparison of LH and OH were included. A systemic review and meta-analysis were performed using the odds ratios (ORs) for dichotomous variables and weighted mean differences (WMDs) for continuous variables. Results: Of 138 studies, 3 RCTs and 4 OCSs were eligible for inclusion criteria, comprising 1543 cases of LH and 657 cases of OH. Compared with OH, shorter operative time for bilateral hernias (WMD = −11.14; 95% confidence interval [CI], −20.61 to −1.68; P = .02) and lower rate of metachronic contralateral hernia (OR, 0.26; 95% CI, 0.09-0.76; P = .01) were noted in LH. However, no significant difference was observed between LH and OH in patients' age, sex, affected side, operative time for unilateral hernias, duration of hospital stay, time to resume full activity, recurrence, and complications. Conclusions: Laparoscopic herniorrhaphy is superior to OH in the repair of bilateral PIH and lower rate of metachronic contralateral hernia, with similar operative time for unilateral hernias, length of hospital stay, recurrence, and complication rates.

Relative merits of each are unclear. Methods A systematic review and meta-analysis was performed comparing outcomes following OPFC and SR in infants with simple gastroschisis.

67,PRISMA,"The spectrum of esophageal atresia (EA) and tracheoesophageal fistula (TEF) include an isolated EA, EA with a proximal and/or distal TEF and the “H” or “N” type fistula. Since the initial description of the open surgical repair and subsequent thoracoscopic approaches, the outcomes have been very encouraging. Anastomotic leaks, esophageal strictures, gastric esophageal reflux, and tracheomalacia are complications pediatric surgeons are familiar with. The incidence of a fistula recurrence range from 1.9 to 11% after open and thoracoscopic repairs.

70,PRISMA,"Abstract & Introduction: The laparoscopic treatment of pediatric populations remains controversial. This review was conducted to compare the clinical and cost effectiveness of laparoscopic and open surgical approaches for a variety of surgical indications in pediatric populations. Method/ Design: A computerized comprehensive search supplemented by a manual review of the literature was performed for all peer-reviewed publications comparing laparo-scopic and open appendectomy, fundoplication and hernia repair cohorts. Outcomes of interest were length of stay (LOS), operating room (OR) time, complication rates and total hospital costs; aggregation of outcome rates was performed with the Mantel-Haenszel method. Results: A total of 24 articles were identified that met the search and inclusion criteria. LOS was found to be signifi-cantly reduced in favor of the laparoscopic approach, with a weighted mean difference of − 1.44 days, although the OR time was signifi-cantly increased, with a weighted mean difference of + 12.8 min. Laparoscopic intervention was associated with a significantly reduced complication rate compared to the open approach (10.6 vs. 15.6 % ). Total hospital costs of the laparoscopic approaches were found to be insignifi-cantly increased compared to the open techniques.

80,PRISMA,"Objective: (1) Is screening of intestinal rotational anatomy obligatory in ‘‘asymptomatic’’ patients with heterotaxy? (2) Does detection of an anomaly warrant surgical correction? Summary of Background Data: Heterotaxy is an abnormal arrangement of thoraco-abdominal viscera across a left-to-right axis. Intestinal rotational anomalies are frequent among patients with heterotaxy, but debate exists as to whether they are benign in nature, requiring careful observation alone, or if surgical correction is warranted to prevent obstruction or midgut volvulus. Methods: A systematic review [according to PRISMA guidelines] was conducted using CINAHL, EMBASE, Medline, and Cochrane Databases. Article quality was assessed using MINORS criteria. Conference proceedings and unpublished data were screened additionally. Results: Nineteen studies met the eligibility criteria but reporting was adequate for 9. All were observational studies. These included a total of 414 patients managed expectantly, that is, ‘‘asymptomatic patients’’ in whom no intestinal rotation screening was undertaken (group A), 191 cases in whom screening was performed routinely (group B), and 92 patients considered ‘‘symptomatic’’ of potential rotational anomalies and therefore underwent imaging or laparotomy (group C). In group A, 1 patient developed symptoms attributable to malrotation in whom laparotomy confirmed the diagnosis (0.24%).

96,PRISMA,"Discussion: Several large multicenter series confirmed an excellent safety and feasibility of L-TERPT/TERPT. It was suggested that L-TERPT and TERPT had advantages over OPEN procedures such as shorter time to feeding, shorter hospital stay, less pain, and better cosmesis. However, functional results after transanal repair versus open techniques may not be superior and even associated with additional problems due to extensive stretching by retractors to gain visualization with subsequent damage to the anal canal. To date, there has been no randomized controlled study evaluating the long-term outcome of OPEN surgery compared with L-TERPT/TERPT. Therefore, the present review could only focus on retrospective studies with a high variability of follow-up periods and definition of outcome parameters. We focused on long-term outcome in HD patients operated with conventional transabdominal pull-through (OPEN) compared with transanal endorectal pull-through with or without laparoscopy (L-TERPT/TERPT) using four major outcome parameters: constipation, incontinence, enterocolitis and anastomotic stricture. Constipation: The incidence of postpull-through constipation in the current literature ranges from 0 to 59%. Suspected causes include abnormal motility of the pulled-through segment and abnormal function of the internal anal sphincter due to the underlying disease or preceding surgery. However, most authors describe an improvement of constipation in late childhood. Our systematic review revealed postoperative constipation rates of up to 59%. Furthermore, it confirms previous reports on a higher incidence of postoperative constipation after OPEN surgery when compared with L-TERPT/TERPT. Soiling/Incontinence: Most patients with HD have been reported to suffer from soiling which remains the major cause of psychological and social problems in these patients. Besides constipation, fecal soiling/incontinence has therefore been identified as the most relevant long-term complication after any type of surgery for HD. Three major causes of soiling have been described: abnormal sphincter function, abnormal sensation, and “pseudoincontinence.” The latter is caused by either severe constipation with fecal overflow or hypermotility of the pulled-through colon. Levitt et al postulate that sphincter function and sensation may be damaged during the primary repair, and that the colonic motility is substantially affected by an operation for HD. However, it is noteworthy that patients with HD lack rectoanal relaxation reflex not only after but also before surgery. Therefore, it remains unclear to what extent surgical dissection of the rectum compromises relevant nerval structures responsible for anal canal sensa-tion, sphincter competence, and colonic motility. There is an ongoing debate on whether the incidence of soiling/incontinence is associated with the operative technique. Some authors suggest that extensive mechani-cal stretching during L-TERPT/TERPT by retractors can damage the anal canal and might therefore lead to a higher incidence of incontinent HD patients. However, our data do not reflect these concerns as it shows that soiling/incontinence occurs significantly more often after OPEN compared with L-TERPT/TERPT surgery. The higher incidence of soiling/incontinence in the OPEN surgery group may derive from deep pelvic dissection affecting pelvic nerves and therefore compromising both sphincter function and sensa-tion. Enterocolitis: Hirschsprung-associated enterocolitis (HAEC) represents an-other major postoperative complication and is the most common cause of death in children with HD. The patho-genesis of HAEC is still unknown. Several risk factors for HAEC have been identified including diagnosis at young age, anastomotic stricture, and malnutrition. Some authors report that obstruction at the level of the anus leading to intestinal stasis may play a major role in HAEC pathogenesis. The potential reasons for intestinal stasis include a spastic or long cuff, presuming that a shorter cuff might help to reduce postoperative enterocolitis. However, as HAEC may occur both before and after surgery for HD, the high incidence of HAEC cannot be explained by partial obstruction alone. We did not find a significant difference in the incidence of enterocolitis after OPEN surgery compared with L-TERPT/TERPT. This may indicate that HAEC is rather part of the underlying pathology of HD than a result of a particular surgical technique. Anastomotic Stricture: Multiple risk factors for anastomotic stricture including anastomotic ischemia, anastomotic leakage, and cuff ischemia have been described. Various surgical techniques were suggested to prevent stricture formation, such as an oblique coloanal anastomosis reported by Swenson. The studies analyzed in this review showed no significant difference in the incidence of anastomotic stricture after OPEN surgery compared with L-TERPT/TERPT surgery. Discussion: Although the present review of the recent literature revealed a higher incidence of constipation and soiling/incontinence after OPEN surgery compared with L-TERPT/TERPT, these data need to be carefully interpreted. The following limitations of the present analysis and validity of the data on the long-term outcome in the current literature may be discussed: • There was a lack of uniform definitions of outcome parameters after surgery for HD such as constipation, soiling, incontinence, enterocolitis, and stricture. • In a very few studies, standardized scores to describe endpoints were used. • L-TERPT and TERPT were analyzed as one group, which is due to the difficulty to distinguish whether laparoscopy was used for biopsies only or for dissection of the rectum. A comprehensive description of the surgical technique was lacking in numerous reports. • The OPEN surgery group consisted of several pull-through techniques such as Soave, Swenson, Duhamel, and Rehbein which might have led to a high variability of results. • The OPEN group was comparable to the L-TERPT/TERPT group in terms of “age at surgery” and “group size” but the follow-up period was significantly longer. As the functional results tend to be more favorable with increasing age, the high rate of constipation and soiling in the OPEN group is remarkable. • Comparative, randomized studies evaluating outcome of OPEN surgery versus L-TERPT/TERPT were not available for this review. Therefore, the validity of the data and level of evidence of the present analysis is limited. Conclusion: Functional outcome of different surgical techniques for HD is highly variable. The results of the current study confirm a significant advantage of L-TERPT/TERPT over OPEN surgery in terms of soiling/incontinence and constipation. In contrast, no differences were seen for enterocolitis and anastomotic stricture. Several limitations to this systematic review such as the different quality of studies and small cohort sizes need to be considered when interpreting these data. Moreover, only few authors used standardized scores to assess functional outcome. Hence, prospective, randomized, multicenter trials are urgently needed to overcome this weakness of the available reports in current literature.",fulltext,"Discussion Several large multicenter series confirmed an excellent safety and feasibility of L-TERPT/TERPT. It was suggested that LTERPT and TERPT had advantages over OPEN procedures such as shorter time to feeding, shorter hospital stay, less pain, and better cosmesis. 15,31–35 Recently, Langer et al discussed that although L-TERPT and TERPT are often thought of as separate approaches, the techniques are similar in most aspects. 33 The main difference is the preparation of the rectum: Laparoscopy allows additional dissection of the rectum from above, whereas by using a transanal technique, the rectum is dissected from below only. The authors further stated that many “transanal” surgeons used laparoscopy for biopsy and/or mobilization of the proximal colon without using it for rectal dissection, making the “L-TERPT” technique a very heterogeneous approach. Therefore, no study has been published to date comparing L-TERPT with TERPT and Langer conclude that this question has increasingly become less relevant. 33 Hence, for the present study, we decided to analyze L-TERPT and TERPT as one group. However, functional results after transanal repair versus open techniques may not be superior and even associated Fig. 1 Flowchart indicating the methodology and stages of this systematic review.

The following limitations of the present analysis and validity of the data on the long-term outcome in the current literature may be discussed: • There was a lack of uniform definitions of outcome parameters after surgery for HD such as constipation, soiling, incontinence, enterocolitis, and stricture. • In a very few studies, standardized scores to describe endpoints were used. • L-TERPT and TERPT were analyzed as one group, which is due to the difficulty to distinguish whether laparoscopy was used for biopsies only or for dissection of the rectum. A comprehensive description of the surgical technique was lacking in numerous reports. • The OPEN surgery group consisted of several pull-through techniques such as Soave, Swenson, Duhamel, and Rehbein which might have led to a high variability of results. • The OPEN group was comparable to the L-TERPT/TERPT group in terms of “age at surgery” and “group size” but the follow-up period was significantly longer. As the functional results tend to be more favorable with increasing age, the high rate of constipation and soiling in the OPEN group is remarkable. • Comparative, randomized studies evaluating outcome of OPEN surgery versus L-TERPT/TERPT were not available for this review.

96,PRISMA,"Abstract: Introduction: Various surgical techniques for the treatment of Hirschsprung disease (HD) have been proposed. The most relevant long-term complications of HD surgery include constipation, soiling/incontinence, enterocolitis, and anastomotic stricture. To date, there has been no randomized controlled trial evaluating the long-term outcome of OPEN surgery compared with transanal approaches with and without laparoscopy (laparoscopic-assisted transanal-endorectal pull-through [L-TERPT] and transanal-endorectal pull-through [TERPT]). We performed a systematic literature review of the long-term outcome of OPEN surgery compared with L-TERPT/TERPT. Methods: Our systematic review of the recent literature (2008 to 2012) included reports on long-term outcome of either OPEN surgery or L-TERPT/TERPT with a minimum follow-up period of 12 months. With the cumulative data, a comparative meta-analysis was performed for the outcome parameters “constipation,” “soiling/incontinence,” “enterocolitis,” and “anastomotic stricture.” Results: Functional outcome of surgical techniques for HD was highly variable. We could show a significant advantage of L-TERPT/TERPT over OPEN surgery regarding the incidence of soiling/incontinence and constipation. No differences were seen for enterocolitis and anastomotic stricture. Conclusion: Significant differences in the long-term outcome of OPEN surgery compared with L-TERPT/TERPT were identified in this review. We conclude from our data that L-TERPT/TERPT represents a valid option in the treatment of HD and might have some advantages over the OPEN techniques. However, the present data should be interpreted carefully due to limitations in the quality of the study design in most reports.

99,PRISMA,"Background/purpose: Interval appendicectomy (IA) is commonly performed after successful nonoperative treatment of appendix mass (AM); although, this approach has recently been challenged. We systematically reviewed the pediatric literature with regard to the justification for this practice. Methods: Using a defined search strategy, studies were identified and data were extracted independently by 2 reviewers. Incidences of recurrent appendicitis, complications after IA, and carcinoid tumor were estimated accounting for interstudy heterogeneity. Cost and length of stay of IA were analyzed. Results: Three studies (127 cases) reporting routine nonsurgical treatment were identified; all were retrospective. There was marked interstudy heterogeneity and variable follow-up. After successful nonoperative treatment of AM, the risk of recurrent appendicitis is 20.5% (95% confidence interval [CI], 14.3%-28.4%). The incidence of complications after IA (23 studies, n = 1247) is 3.4% (95% CI, 2.2-5.1), and the incidence of carcinoid tumor found at IA (15 studies, n = 955) is 0.9% (95% CI, 0.5-1.8). No reports compared costs. Mean length of stay for IA is 3 days (range, 1-30 days).
