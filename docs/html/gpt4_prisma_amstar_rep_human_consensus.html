<th style="text-align:left;">
<span style="border-bottom: 1px dashed black"
title="Was a comprehensive literature search performed? At least two electronic sources should be searched. The report must include years and databases used (e.g., Central, EMBASE, and MEDLINE). Key words and/or MESH terms must be stated and where feasible the search strategy should be provided. All searches should be supplemented by consulting current contents, reviews, textbooks, specialized registers, or experts in the particular field of study, and by reviewing the references in the studies found. Note: If at least 2 sources + one supplementary strategy used, select “yes” (Cochrane register/Central counts as 2 sources; a grey literature search counts as supplementary).">
A3</span>
</th>
<th style="text-align:left;">
<span style="border-bottom: 1px dashed black"
title="Was the status of publication (i.e. grey literature) used as an inclusion criterion? The authors should state that they searched for reports regardless of their publication type. The authors should state whether or not they excluded any reports (from the systematic review), based on their publication status, language etc. Note: If review indicates that there was a search for “grey literature” or “unpublished literature,” indicate “yes.” SIGLE database, dissertations, conference proceedings, and trial registries are all considered grey for this purpose. If searching a source that contains both grey and non-grey, must specify that they were searching for grey/unpublished lit.">

In an aggregated form such as a table, data from the original studies should be provided on the participants, interventions and outcomes. The ranges of characteristics in all the studies analyzed e.g., age, race, sex, relevant socioeconomic data, disease status, duration, severity, or other diseases should be reported.

Note: Can include use of a quality scoring tool or checklist, e.g., Jadad scale, risk of bias, sensitivity analysis, etc., or a description of quality items, with some kind of result for EACH study (“low” or “high” is fine, as long as it is clear which studies scored “low” and which scored “high”; a summary score/range for all studies is not acceptable).">

The results of the methodological rigor and scientific quality should be considered in the analysis and the conclusions of the review, and explicitly stated in formulating recommendations. Note: Might say something such as “the results should be interpreted with caution due to poor quality of included studies.” Cannot score “yes” for this question if scored “no” for question A7.">
A8</span>
</th>
<th style="text-align:left;">
<span style="border-bottom: 1px dashed black"
title="Were the methods used to combine the findings of studies appropriate? For the pooled results, a test should be done to ensure the studies were combinable, to assess their homogeneity (i.e., Chi-squared test for homogeneity, I2 ). If heterogeneity exists a random effects model should be used and/or the clinical appropriateness of combining should be taken into consideration (i.e., is it sensible to combine?). Note: Indicate “yes” if they mention or describe heterogeneity, i.e., if they explain that they cannot pool because of heterogeneity/variability between interventions.">
A9</span>
</th>
<th style="text-align:left;">
<span style="border-bottom: 1px dashed black"
title="Was the likelihood of publication bias assessed? An assessment of publication bias should include a combination of graphical aids (e.g., funnel plot, other available tests) and/or statistical tests (e.g., Egger regression test, Hedges-Olken). Note: If no test values or funnel plot included, score “no”. Score “yes” if mentions that publication bias could not be assessed because there were fewer than 10 included studies.">

- The authors discuss limitations at the study and review level.
- [Yes]

P26. Discussion / Conclusions: Provide a general interpretation of the results in the context of other evidence, and implications for future research.
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Our conclusion that OPFC is superior to SR must still be tempered by the low quality of the available primary data, and the limitations of our study.&quot;</span>
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;We therefore believe that the way to promote evidence-based paediatric surgery is by enhancing collaboration between centres.&quot;</span>
- The authors provide a general interpretation of the results and discuss implications for future research.
- [Yes]

P27. Funding: Describe sources of funding for the systematic review and other support (e.g., supply of data); role of funders for the systematic review.

Abstract Purpose: Laparoscopic varicocelectomy has gained popularity in recent years. The aim of this study was to identify clinical evidence about the reliability of this technique in the recent literature. Methods: We performed a Medline search for articles published during the last 10 years, using the key words “varicocele,” “treatment,” and “adolescent.” As limits, we used last 10 years, adolescent, clinical trials, randomized controlled trials, meta-analysis, and multicenter retrospective and prospective studies. The results were investigated in recurrence and hydrocele formation. Results: We pooled 37 studies, but 26 of these were excluded because they were neither relevant nor concerned an adolescent population. Meta-analysis showed that there was no statistical difference between laparoscopic surgery and open surgery in recurrence rate and postoperative hydrocele rate. In the laparoscopic group, the incidence of recurrence was higher in the patients undergoing artery ligation compared to patients undergoing artery and venous ligation. Furthermore, a lower rate of postoperative hydrocele was recorded in patients undergoing dye injections before laparoscopic ligation. Conclusions: Meta-analysis and literature analysis showed that the results after laparoscopic varicocelectomy are comparable to other surgical procedures.

The aim of this study was to identify clinical evidence about the reliability of this technique in the recent literature. Methods: We performed a Medline search for articles published during the last 10 years, using the key words “varicocele,” “treatment,” and “adolescent.” As limits, we used last 10 years, adolescent, clinical trials, randomized controlled trials, meta-analysis, and multicenter retrospective and prospective studies. The results were investigated in recurrence and hydrocele formation. Results: We pooled 37 studies, but 26 of these were excluded because they were neither relevant nor concerned an adolescent population. Meta-analysis showed that there was no statistical difference between laparoscopic surgery and open surgery in recurrence rate and postoperative hydrocele rate. In the laparoscopic group, the incidence of recurrence was higher in the patients undergoing artery ligation compared to patients undergoing artery and venous ligation. Furthermore, a lower rate of postoperative hydrocele was recorded in patients undergoing dye injections before laparoscopic ligation. Conclusions: Meta-analysis and literature analysis showed that the results after laparoscopic varicocelectomy are comparable to other surgical procedures. The laparoscopic approach has the advantage to treat simultaneously bilateral varicocele.&quot;</span>

P3. Introduction / Rationale: Describe the rationale for the review in the context of what is already known.
- Quote: <span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 99.3%):

Varicocele is generally considered the most common correctable cause of male infertility [1,2]. It is indicated as a factor in about one third of infertile males, being associated with testicular atrophy and abnormal seminal factors [3]. Varicocele occurs in 10% to 15% of children and adolescents [4,5]. Several treatment options have been used, including spermatic vein sclerotherapy or embolization, open inguinal ligation of the spermatic vein, subinguinal microscopic varicocelectomy, and, most recently, laparoscopy, but the ideal method for varicocele treatment is still controversial ⁎' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;Varicocele is generally considered the most common correctable cause of male infertility [1,2].

- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;All studies were retrospective case series (meta-analysis was therefore not formally undertaken other than cumulative totals and percentages of data included).&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The authors describe how they handled and combined the results of the studies.
- Response: [Yes]

P15. Methdos / Risk of bias across studies: Specify any assessment of risk of bias that may affect the cumulative evidence (e.g., publication bias, selective reporting within studies).
- Quote: Not applicable.
- Reasoning: The authors do not mention assessing the risk of bias across studies.
- Response: [No]

P16. Methods / Additional analyses: Describe methods of additional analyses (e.g., sensitivity or subgroup analyses, meta-regression), if done, indicating which were pre-specified.
- Quote: Not applicable.
- Reasoning: The authors do not mention conducting any additional analyses.

- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;This systematic review shows that ‘‘asymptomatic patients’’ with heterotaxy are at a low risk of developing IRA-related complications&quot;</span> [...] <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Furthermore, this study highlights that surgical intervention carries a significant complication rate(s).&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The authors summarize the main findings of the review and discuss their relevance.
- Response: [Yes]

P25. Discussion / Limitations: Discuss limitations at study and outcome level (e.g., risk of bias), and at review-level (e.g., incomplete retrieval of identified research, reporting bias).
- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;We fully acknowledge that there are some limitations with the present study. Follow-up reporting data in studies we analyzed was sometimes poor&quot;</span> [...] <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Adequate reporting in studies was thus by no means always satisfactory.&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The authors discuss the limitations of the review.
- Response: [Yes]

P26. Discussion / Conclusions: Provide a general interpretation of the results in the context of other evidence, and implications for future research.
- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Given the fragility of this patient cohort—with cardiac comorbidity(s)—many can therefore avoid an unnecessary Ladd’s operation.&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The authors provide a general interpretation of the results and discuss their implications.
- Response: [Yes]

P27. Funding: Describe sources of funding for the systematic review and other support (e.g., supply of data); role of funders for the systematic review.
- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;No funding was sought or received for this work.&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The authors disclose the lack of funding for the review.

- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Abstract Objective: To understand the role, safety and efficacy of flexible ureterorenoscopy and lasertripsy (FURSL) for paediatric renal stones. Material and methods: A systematic review was conducted using studies identified by a literature search between January 1990 and March 2014. All English language articles reporting on a minimum of five patients 18-years old, treated with flexible ureteroscopy and lasertripsy for stone disease were included. Results: A total of six studies (282 patients) were reported, with a mean age of 7.3 years (range 0.25e17 years). The stone sizes ranged from 1 to 30 mm. The mean stone-free rate across the three studies was 85.5% (range 58.0e93.0%) after initial ureteroscopy, with a postoperative stent inserted in 81.8% (range 66.7e98.0%). There were a total of 35 complications (12.4%), with the most severe complication being a Clavien class III (five ureteral injuries, one urinoma). There were no deaths in any of the studies. Conclusion: The present review shows that FURSL for management of renal calculi in the paediatric population is an effective and safe procedure. To ensure that outcomes keep on improving, these procedures should be undertaken by experienced surgeons who are familiar with the difficulties encountered in the paediatric population.&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The abstract provides a structured summary of the review, including the background, objectives, methods, results, and conclusions.

- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Meta-analysis reveals that recurrence was higher (RR: 3.21 1.11, 9.29, P  0.03) and operative time longer (WMD 50.38 minutes 31.79, 68.97, P  0.00001) in the endosurgical group.&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The authors present the results of the meta-analysis, including confidence intervals.
- Response: [Yes]

P22. Results / Risk of bias across studies: Present results of any assessment of risk of bias across studies (see Item P15).
- Quote: Not available.
- Reasoning: The text does not provide information on the assessment of risk of bias across studies.
- Response: [No]

P23. Results / Additional analysis: Give results of additional analyses, if done (e.g., sensitivity or subgroup analyses, meta-regression [see Item P16]).
- Quote: Not available.
- Reasoning: The text does not provide information on any additional analyses.
- Response: [No]

P24. Discussion / Summary of evidence: Summarize the main findings including the strength of evidence for each main outcome; consider their relevance to key groups (e.g., healthcare providers, users, and policy makers).
- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;This meta-analysis illustrates that thoracoscopic neonatal CDH repair is currently associated with higher CDH recurrence risk and longer operative times compared with open CDH repair.&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The authors summarize the main findings of the review.
- Response: [Yes]

P25. Discussion / Limitations: Discuss limitations at study and outcome level (e.g., risk of bias), and at review-level (e.g., incomplete retrieval of identified research, reporting bias).
- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;However, these findings need to be considered in the context of the methodological limitations of the studies available for inclusion.&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The authors discuss the limitations of the review.
- Response: [Yes]

P26. Discussion / Conclusions: Provide a general interpretation of the results in the context of other evidence, and implications for future research.
- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Better quality evidence is therefore required. Systematic reviews and meta-analyses frequently conclude with calls for more randomized controlled trials (RCTs). In contrast, we call for prospective, comprehensive, multi-institutional registry data on neonatal endosurgical CDH repair.&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The authors provide a general interpretation of the results and discuss implications for future research.
- Response: [Yes]

P27. Funding: Describe sources of funding for the systematic review and other support (e.g., supply of data); role of funders for the systematic review.
- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;E.C.J. is supported by a New Investigator Award from the UK Medical Research Council; N.L. is supported by a Wellcome Trust Clinical Research Training Fellowship and was previously supported by the Royal College of Surgeons of England.&quot;</span>

Note: Can include use of a quality scoring tool or checklist, e.g., Jadad scale, risk of bias, sensitivity analysis, etc., or a description of quality items, with some kind of result for EACH study (“low” or “high” is fine, as long as it is clear which studies scored “low” and which scored “high”; a summary score/range for all studies is not acceptable).">

The results of the methodological rigor and scientific quality should be considered in the analysis and the conclusions of the review, and explicitly stated in formulating recommendations.

title="Were the methods used to combine the findings of studies appropriate? For the pooled results, a test should be done to ensure the studies were combinable, to assess their homogeneity (i.e., Chi-squared test for homogeneity, I2 ). If heterogeneity exists a random effects model should be used and/or the clinical appropriateness of combining should be taken into consideration (i.e., is it sensible to combine?). Note: Indicate “yes” if they mention or describe heterogeneity, i.e., if they explain that they cannot pool because of heterogeneity/variability between interventions.">

title="Was the likelihood of publication bias assessed? An assessment of publication bias should include a combination of graphical aids (e.g., funnel plot, other available tests) and/or statistical tests (e.g., Egger regression test, Hedges-Olken). Note: If no test values or funnel plot included, score “no”. Score “yes” if mentions that publication bias could not be assessed because there were fewer than 10 included studies.">

Summary Objective Aphallia is a rare penile congenital abnormality. The aim of this systematic review was to assess all available literature on neophalloplasty in infancy with an interest in technical alternatives and clinical outcome. Materials and methods We performed a Pubmed search using the terms: neophalloplasty, neophallus, and phalloplasty, and selected articles that presented technical alternatives for penile construction in cases of penile dysgenesis, especially aphallia in children and/or adolescents. Results A total of 319 articles were identified in the initial search. Among the different techniques presented in 19 papers collected, we categorized reconstructive procedures into two groups: microsurgical and non-microsurgical techniques. Among the microsurgical techniques, procedures such as the osteocutaneous fibular flap (n Z 18), the myocutaneous latissimus dorsi flap (n Z 24), and the radial forearm free flap (n Z 293) were reported. Among the non-microsurgical techniques, we found a wider range of technical options (6 in total). Most were based on groin, abdominal, and scrotal flaps. Long-term reports on the functionability of the neophallus and psychological aspects of the patients are lacking. Conclusion In assessing recent literature, it seems rational that neophalloplasty should be regarded as the preferred strategy for boys born with aphallia, in opposition to female gender assignment.' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;Summary: Objective: Aphallia is a rare penile congenital abnormality.

Abstract Background/Purpose: Total esophagogastric dissociation has been described as both a primary and a rescue procedure for patients with severe gastroesophageal reflux. Although most commonly used in the neurologically impaired, it has also been used in those with no neurological impairment. The main objective of this study was to determine morbidity and mortality for this procedure. Methods: All published cases of esophagogastric dissociation in children were identified. Series were updated where possible by personal communication with the author. Patient characteristics, indications, morbidity, and mortality were analyzed. Results: One hundred eighty-one cases were identified. One hundred seventeen were primary operations and 64 were rescue procedures. There were 29 (16.0%) early complications and 28 (15.5%) late complications with 6 (3.3%) deaths related to the procedure of a total of 35 deaths. Twenty-one patients (11.6%) required re-operation in the study periods. Conclusions: Esophagogastric dissociation has an acceptable morbidity and mortality. It is useful as both a primary and a rescue procedure.' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;Abstract: Background/Purpose: Total esophagogastric dissociation has been described as both a primary and a rescue procedure for patients with severe gastroesophageal reflux.

title="Were the methods used to combine the findings of studies appropriate? For the pooled results, a test should be done to ensure the studies were combinable, to assess their homogeneity (i.e., Chi-squared test for homogeneity, I2 ). If heterogeneity exists a random effects model should be used and/or the clinical appropriateness of combining should be taken into consideration (i.e., is it sensible to combine?). Note: Indicate “yes” if they mention or describe heterogeneity, i.e., if they explain that they cannot pool because of heterogeneity/variability between interventions.">

Abstract Purpose The transanal one-stage pull-through procedure (TERPT) has gained worldwide popularity over open and laparoscopic-assisted one-stage techniques in children with Hirschsprung’s disease (HD). It offers the advantages of avoiding laparotomy, laparoscopy, scars, abdominal contamination, and adhesions. However, enterocolitis associated with Hirschsprung’s disease (HAEC) still remains to be a potentially life-threatening complication after pullthrough operation. The reported incidence of HAEC ranges from 4.6 to 54%. This meta-analysis was designed to evaluate postoperative incidence of HAEC following TERPT procedure.' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;Abstract Purpose The transanal one-stage pull-through procedure (TERPT) has gained worldwide popularity over open and laparoscopic-assisted one-stage techniques in children with Hirschsprung’s disease (HD).

Abstract Background Achalasia is a rare idiopathic neuromuscular disorder of the esophagus, characterized as a syndrome of impaired relaxation of the lower esophageal sphincter and decreased peristalsis of the esophageal body. Objective The primary objective is to determine the best first-line treatment for pediatric achalasia based on the consolidation of the current literature that compares outcomes after pneumatic dilatation (PD) versus surgical myotomy (Heller esophagomyotomy [HM]). Data Sources A systematic review of English articles using OVID was performed. Study Selection OVID was used to search for articles focusing on the treatment of pediatric esophageal achalasia with PD versus HM. Data Extraction Independent extraction of data was performed by N.E.S using predefined data fields. Data Synthesis Seven articles were included in the systematic review. Techniques of HM and PD varied widely. The best first-line treatment of pediatric achalasia was determined to be HM in two articles, PD in one article, and equal efficacy in one article. Three articles concluded that appropriate initial treatment was determined by the age of the child. Conclusion Adequate comparative data are lacking to determine the ideal treatment of pediatric achalasia. Appropriately designed randomized controlled trials with longterm follow-up are needed to determine ideal treatment algorithms in pediatric achalasia.' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;Abstract: Background Achalasia is a rare idiopathic neuromuscular disorder of the esophagus, characterized as a syndrome of impaired relaxation of the lower esophageal sphincter and decreased peristalsis of the esophageal body.

title="Were the methods used to combine the findings of studies appropriate? For the pooled results, a test should be done to ensure the studies were combinable, to assess their homogeneity (i.e., Chi-squared test for homogeneity, I2 ). If heterogeneity exists a random effects model should be used and/or the clinical appropriateness of combining should be taken into consideration (i.e., is it sensible to combine?). Note: Indicate “yes” if they mention or describe heterogeneity, i.e., if they explain that they cannot pool because of heterogeneity/variability between interventions.">

title="Was the likelihood of publication bias assessed? An assessment of publication bias should include a combination of graphical aids (e.g., funnel plot, other available tests) and/or statistical tests (e.g., Egger regression test, Hedges-Olken). Note: If no test values or funnel plot included, score “no”. Score “yes” if mentions that publication bias could not be assessed because there were fewer than 10 included studies.">

Background: Improvements in laparoscopic surgery have led to the introduction of laparoendoscopic single-site surgery (LESS) as an alternative to conventional laparoscopy conferring a number of possible advantages. In this review, we aim to elucidate the aspects of LESS for major urological procedures in the pediatric population. Materials and methods: An in-depth search of the literature was performed in the databases of PubMed and Scopus, for studies investigating the technical aspects and clinical outcomes of partial nephrectomies, nephrectomies, nephroureterectomies, varicocelectomies and pyeloplasties in children. Data on parameters such as operation time, instrumentation, perioperative complications, hospital stay and follow up period were collected and further analyzed cumulatively. Results: Twenty nine studies met the inclusion criteria incorporating 386 patients who underwent 401 procedures. There were no major intraoperative complications, with only 19 patients (4.73%) facing postoperative complications. No perioperative deaths were reported. Conclusions: In the hands of experienced surgeons LESS seems a feasible, efficient and less invasive alternative to standard laparoscopy in the field of pediatric urology. There is an eminent need of welldesigned randomized controlled trials comparing the two techniques.' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;Background: Improvements in laparoscopic surgery have led to the introduction of laparoendoscopic single-site surgery (LESS) as an alternative to conventional laparoscopy conferring a number of possible advantages.

For the pooled results, a test should be done to ensure the studies were combinable, to assess their homogeneity (i.e., Chi-squared test for homogeneity, I2 ). If heterogeneity exists a random effects model should be used and/or the clinical appropriateness of combining should be taken into consideration (i.e., is it sensible to combine?).

Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The present meta-anlaysis shows that the overall risk of MCIH in children (aged 0–19 years) is 6%. The risk of MCIH development is significantly greater in children with initial left-sided hernia (8.5% vs. 3.3%) and in children with open CPV (13.8% vs. 3%).&quot;</span>
Reasoning: The authors summarize the main findings and their relevance.
Response: [Yes]

P25. Discussion / Limitations: Discuss limitations at study and outcome level (e.g., risk of bias), and at review-level (e.g., incomplete retrieval of identified research, reporting bias).
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Lack of uniformity in age restrictions and variation in inclusion and exclusion criteria (e.g. exclusion of patients with ascites) that were applied in different analyses may also have impacted on results.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: The authors discuss some limitations of the review.
Response: [Yes]

P26. Discussion / Conclusions: Provide a general interpretation of the results in the context of other evidence, and implications for future research.
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The present meta-analysis shows, that nearly 17 (overall MCIH = 6%; 100/6 = 16.7) contralateral explorations (number needed to treat) are necessary in order to prevent one metachronous inguinal hernia.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: The authors provide a general interpretation of the results and discuss implications for future research.
Response: [Yes]

P27. Funding: Describe sources of funding for the systematic review and other support (e.g., supply of data); role of funders for the systematic review.
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Source of funding: There was no funding to the present study.&quot;</span>

Two more articles were identified by manual search. All papers were identified for further evaluation after the titles and abstracts were read. Twenty-eight measured up to the criteria and were included [4–31]. According to the institutions of authors and year of the patients included, two reports were repetitive and excluded [30, 31]. Four hundred and eighty were excluded because they were animal studies, review articles, adults cases, irrelevant to the current study or published in language other than English (Fig. 1).&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The authors give numbers of studies screened, assessed for eligibility, and included in the review, with reasons for exclusions at each stage, and provide a flow diagram.

- Reasoning: The authors summarize the main findings and consider their relevance to key groups.
- Response: [Yes]

P25. Discussion / Limitations: Discuss limitations at study and outcome level (e.g., risk of bias), and at review-level (e.g., incomplete retrieval of identified research, reporting bias).
- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Limitation related to the heterogeneity of included studies. Firstly, the initial operations of patients included in each study were various, including pancreatectomy, Ladd’s operation, paraesophageal hernia repair, operation for choledochal cyst, retroperitoneal tumor resection and so on. Only eight studies included patients receiving all operations during the study. With the influence of the selection bias, the force of this study was weakened. Secondly, the level of the institutions, experiences of surgeon, the selection of diagnostic modality were also different among studies, which make the combination analysis and drawing a powerful conclusion difficult.&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The authors discuss limitations at the study and review level.
- Response: [Yes]

P26. Discussion / Conclusions: Provide a general interpretation of the results in the context of other evidence, and implications for future research.
- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;POI is a rare complication in children receiving surgery. Early recognition of this entity is difficult because of the rarity and atypical clinical presentations. The etiology is unclear. The theories trying to explain mechanisms of POI include altered peristalsis, early postoperative adhesions, prolonged and excessive bowel manipulation, electrolyte disturbances in lengthy surgeries, anesthetic drugs, opioid analgesics and neurogenic factors [32]. Since the POI occurs in a wide range of procedures, irrespective of abdominal or non-abdominal, the mechanism may be explained by more than one of the above theories.&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The authors provide a general interpretation of the results in the context of other evidence, and implications for future research.
- Response: [Yes]

P27. Funding: Describe sources of funding for the systematic review and other support (e.g., supply of data); role of funders for the systematic review.
- Quote: Not available.
- Reasoning: The authors do not describe sources of funding for the systematic review.

- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Abstract Objectives To compare the safety and efficacy of minimally invasive surgery (MIS) with traditional open surgical approach for congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH). Methods A literature search was performed using the PubMed database, Embase, and the Cochrane central register of controlled trials using a defined set of criteria. The outcomes, which include post-operative mortality, incidence of hernia recurrence, rates of patch use and complications, were analyzed. Results We investigated nine studies, which included 507 patients. All studies were non-randomized historical control trials. The MIS group had a significantly lower rate of post-operative death with a risk ratio of 0.26 [95 % confidence interval (CI) 0.10–0.68; p = 0.006] but a greater incidence of hernia recurrence with a risk ratio of 3.42 (95 % CI 1.98–5.88; p \ 0.00001). Rates of prosthetic patch use were similar between the two groups. Fewer cases of surgical complications were found in the MIS group with a risk ratio of 0.66 (95 % CI 0.47–0.94; p = 0.02). Conclusions MIS for CDH repair is associated with lower post-operative mortality and morbidity compared with traditional open repair. Although rate of patch use appears to be comparable, the increased risk of CDH recurrence should not be ignored. The lack of well-controlled prospective trials still limits strong evaluations of the two surgical techniques.&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The abstract provides a structured summary of the review.
- Response: [Yes]

P3. Introduction / Rationale: Describe the rationale for the review in the context of what is already known.
- Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) is a congenital defect in diaphragm development, which occurs in approximately 1 in 2500–4000 live births [1]. Surgical repair via laparotomy or thoracotomy is the traditional treatment for patients with CDH. Since the first report by Silen et al. on thoracoscopic CDH repair in an adolescent in 1995 [2], minimally invasive surgery (MIS) techniques, both laparoscopic and thoracoscopic, have been considered as alternative approaches for CDH repair. However, this new technique has not gained widespread acceptance among surgeons mainly because of the controversy involving its safety and efficacy, such as mortality, recurrence rate and complication rate.&quot;</span>

Materials and Methods: Studies published since 1992 that compared SILA versus TILA in laparoscopic appendicectomy were collected. Data on operative parameters, postoperative recovery, postoperative pain and complications, and hospitalization costs for SILA and TILA were meta-analyzed using fixed-effect and random-effect models. Results: Seventeen studies (1 randomized controlled trial and 16 retrospective studies) that included 1809 patients were studied. Of these patients, 793 and 1016 had undergone SILA and TILA, respectively. There was significantly shorter length of hospital stay; however, there were evidently higher conversion rate, and perhaps higher surgical difficulty and hospitalization costs for SILA compared with TILA. Other outcome variables such as operative time, blood loss, time to first oral intake, postoperative pain and complications were not found to be statistically significant for either group. Conclusions: Compared with TILA, SILA has the advantage of shorter hospital stay, and it can achieve comparable operative time, blood loss, postoperative recovery, postoperative pain and complications with TILA.

Materials and Methods: Published studies until the end of October 2010 were searched from Medline, Embase, Web of Science, Ovid, and Cochrane databases. The literature search, quality assessment, and data extraction were independently performed by two reviewers. A systematic review and meta-analysis were performed by using Review Manager 4.2.8 software. Results: Of 1403 studies, one randomized controlled trial (RCT), two prospective comparative studies, and six retrospective observational studies were eligible for inclusion criteria, comprising 694 cases of LP and 7334 cases of OP. The OP has significantly reduced operative time (weighted mean difference [WMD] = 59.00; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 41.15 to 76.85; P < 0.00001) and higher stent placement rate (odds ratio [OR] = 5.97; 95% CI = 3.17 to 11.26; P < 0.00001) compared with LP, whereas the duration of hospital stay was shorter in the LP group (WMD = - 0.40; 95% CI = - 0.77 to - 0.03; P = 0.03). No difference was observed between LP and OP regarding complications (OR = 0.78; 95% CI = 0.46 to 1.34; P = 0.37) or success rate (OR = 1.76; 95% CI = 0.71 to 4.36; P = 0.22). Conclusions: LP is a minimally invasive, safe, and effective therapy method for UPJ obstruction in children, with shorter hospital stay and excellent outcomes, and without additional risk of postoperative complications. Because of the publishing bias, a series of RCTs are necessary to explore the efficiencies of LP in the management of UPJ obstruction in children.'\n- Reasoning: The abstract provides a structured summary including background, objectives, data sources, study eligibility criteria, participants, interventions, study appraisal and synthesis methods, results, limitations, and conclusions.\n- Response: [Yes]\n\nP3.

Title: Identify the report as a systematic review, meta-analysis, or both.\nQuote: 'Fundoplication versus postoperative medication for gastro-oesophageal reflux in children with neurological impairment undergoing gastrostomy (Review)'\nReasoning: The title identifies the report as a systematic review.\nResponse: [Yes]\n\nP2. Abstract / Structured summary: Provide a structured summary including, as applicable: background; objectives; data sources; study eligibility criteria, participants, and interventions; study appraisal and synthesis methods; results; limitations; conclusions and implications of key findings; systematic review registration number.\nQuote: 'ABSTRACT Background Children with neurological impairments frequently experience feeding difficulties, which can lead to malnutrition and growth failure. Gastrostomy feeding is now the preferred method of providing nutritional support to children with neurological impairments who are unable to feed adequately by mouth. Complications may arise as a result of gastrostomy placement, and the development or worsening of gastro-oesophageal reflux (GOR) has been widely reported. This has led to the frequent use of surgical antireflux treatment in the form of a fundoplication, or other antireflux procedures. Fundoplication is associated with a high recurrence rate, surgical failure, and significant morbidity and mortality. Since proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) were introduced in the 1990s, they have come to play a larger part in the medical management of GOR in children with neurological impairments. Uncontrolled studies suggest that PPIs may be a safe, appropriate treatment for GOR. Other agents currently used include milk thickeners, acid suppression drugs, acid buffering agents, gut motility stimulants and sodium alginate preparations. There are risks and benefits associated with both surgical and medical interventions and further comparison is necessary to determine the optimal treatment choice. Objectives To compare the effectiveness of antireflux surgery and antireflux medications for children with neurological impairments and GOR who are undergoing placement of a gastrostomy feeding tube. Search methods We searched the following databases on 23 March 2012: the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Ovid MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, LILACS and ISI Web of Science. Previously, we searched the Child Health Library in June 2009. We also performed online searches of trial registries, medical journals, conference proceedings, dissertations and theses. We contacted specialists in the medical and industry setting for knowledge of completed or ongoing trials. Selection criteria We sought to include randomised controlled trials that recruited children up to the age of 18 years with neurological impairments and GOR who were undergoing gastrostomy tube insertion. Data collection and analysis The review authors worked independently to select trials; none were identified. Main results We identified no trials that satisfied the criteria for this review. Authors' conclusions There remains considerable uncertainty regarding the optimal treatment when faced with the decision of fundoplication surgery versus antireflux medications for children with GOR and neurological impairment who are undergoing gastrostomy insertion. There is a need for robust scientific evidence in order to provide data on the comparable risks or benefits of the two interventions.'\nReasoning: The abstract provides a structured summary including background, objectives, data sources, study eligibility criteria, participants, interventions, study appraisal and synthesis methods, results, limitations, and conclusions.\nResponse: [Yes]\n\nP3. Introduction / Rationale: Describe the rationale for the review in the context of what is already known.\nQuote: 'Children with neurological impairments frequently experience profound feeding difficulties, which can lead to malnutrition and growth failure. These are often seen as inevitable consequences of many neurological disorders due to their associated physical abnormalities, communication difficulties and motor impairments (Samson-Fang 2003). The causes of malnutrition in children with neurological impairments are multifactorial. Physiological abnormalities may manifest as oro-motor dysfunction and the associated inco-ordination of oropharyngeal reflexes (Puntis 2000; Wadie 2002). Children may also be severely compromised in their inability to feed independently and subsequently experience frustration and behavioural problems (Puntis 2000). Many of the factors that lead to malnutrition and failure to thrive dictate a need to find alternative measures of providing adequate nutrition, such as an enteral feeding tube (Wadie 2002).'\nReasoning: The introduction provides a rationale for the review in the context of what is already known.\nResponse: [Yes]\n\nP4. Introduction / Objectives: Provide an explicit statement of questions being addressed with reference to participants, interventions, comparisons, outcomes, and study design (PICOS).\nQuote: 'To compare the effectiveness of antireflux surgery and antireflux medications for children with neurological impairments and GOR who are undergoing placement of a gastrostomy feeding tube.'\nReasoning: The objective provides an explicit statement of the question being addressed with reference to participants, interventions, comparisons, and outcomes.\nResponse: [Yes]\n\nP5. Methods / Protocol and registration: Indicate if a review protocol exists, if and where it can be accessed (e.g., Web address), and, if available, provide registration information including registration number.\nQuote: 'The protocol for this review was published in The Cochrane Library in Issue 3, 2006.'\nReasoning: The review indicates that a protocol exists and where it can be accessed.\nResponse: [Yes]\n\nP6. Methods / Eligibility criteria: Specify study characteristics (e.g., PICOS, length of follow-up) and report characteristics (e.g., years considered, language, publication status) used as criteria for eligibility, giving rationale.\nQuote: 'We sought to include randomised controlled trials that recruited children up to the age of 18 years with neurological impairments and GOR who were undergoing gastrostomy tube insertion.'\nReasoning: The review specifies the study characteristics used as criteria for eligibility.\nResponse: [Yes]\n\nP7. Methods / Information sources: Describe all information sources (e.g., databases with dates of coverage, contact with study authors to identify additional studies) in the search and date last searched.\nQuote: 'We searched the following databases on 23 March 2012: the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Ovid MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, LILACS and ISI Web of Science. Previously, we searched the Child Health Library in June 2009. We also performed online searches of trial registries, medical journals, conference proceedings, dissertations and theses. We contacted specialists in the medical and industry setting for knowledge of completed or ongoing trials.'\nReasoning: The review describes all information sources in the search and the date last searched.\nResponse: [Yes]\n\nP8. Methods / Search: Present full electronic search strategy for at least one database, including any limits used, such that it could be repeated.\nQuote: 'We searched the following databases on 23 March 2012: the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Ovid MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, LILACS and ISI Web of Science.'\nReasoning: The review presents the databases searched but does not provide the full electronic search strategy.\nResponse: [No]\n\nP9. Methods / Study selection: State the process for selecting studies (i.e., screening, eligibility, included in systematic review, and, if applicable, included in the meta-analysis).\nQuote: 'The review authors worked independently to select trials; none were identified.'\nReasoning: The review states the process for selecting studies.\nResponse: [Yes]\n\nP10. Methods / Data collection process: Describe method of data extraction from reports (e.g., piloted forms, independently, in duplicate) and any processes for obtaining and confirming data from investigators.\nQuote: 'Data extraction forms will be designed to include study design, participant characteristics, study setting, intervention type and outcomes. Data will be extracted independently by two review authors (AVR and PBS) and disagreements will be resolved through discussion or by contacting the study author for further information. Data will be organised using Review Manager 5.2.'\nReasoning: The review describes the method of data extraction from reports.\nResponse: [Yes]\n\nP11. Methods / Data items: List and define all variables for which data were sought (e.g., PICOS, funding sources) and any assumptions and simplifications made.\nQuote: 'Data extraction forms will be designed to include study design, participant characteristics, study setting, intervention type and outcomes.'\nReasoning: The review lists and defines all variables for which data were sought.\nResponse: [Yes]\n\nP12. Methods / Risk of bias in individual studies: Describe methods used for assessing risk of bias of individual studies (including specification of whether this was done at the study or outcome level), and how this information is to be used in any data synthesis.\nQuote: 'Selected studies will be independently evaluated by two review authors (AVR and PBS) using The Cochrane Collaboration's tool for assessing the risk of bias (Higgins 2011). Disagreements over suitability for inclusion will be resolved by discussion or adjudication, or both, by editors of the Cochrane Developmental, Psychosocial and Learning Problems Group. The tool will assess the following items: sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding, incomplete outcome data, selective outcome reporting and other sources of bias. Studies will be assigned a quality category (high, low and unclear risk of bias) and supporting evidence will be presented in a 'Risk of bias' table.'\nReasoning: The review describes the methods used for assessing risk of bias of individual studies.\nResponse: [Yes]\n\nP13. Methods / Summary measures: State the principal summary measures (e.g., risk ratio, difference in means).\nQuote: 'For dichotomous data, the risk ratio and its 95% confidence interval will be calculated. For studies using standardised assessment tools that have generated a scored outcome measure, we will calculate a mean difference. For studies using different scales, we will calculate the standardised difference in means with a 95% confidence interval.'\nReasoning: The review states the principal summary measures.\nResponse: [Yes]\n\nP14. Methods / Synthesis of results: Describe the methods of handling data and combining results of studies, if done, including measures of consistency (e.g., I2) for each meta-analysis.\nQuote: 'Where meta-analysis is feasible (that is, if two or more included studies are identified that are considered sufficiently homogeneous), we will perform a meta-analysis.'\nReasoning: The review describes the methods of handling data and combining results of studies, if done.\nResponse: [Yes]\n\nP15. Methods / Risk of bias across studies: Specify any assessment of risk of bias that may affect the cumulative evidence (e.g., publication bias, selective reporting within studies).\nQuote: 'We will attempt to avoid publication bias by seeking data from all sources including conference proceedings and unpublished data from pharmaceutical companies (see search strategy). Should sufficient data be identified, funnel plots will be drawn to investigate any relationship between effect size and study precision (closely related to sample size). Such a relationship could be due to publication or related biases, systematic differences between small and large studies, or poor methodology. If a relationship is found, clinical diversity of the studies will be further examined as a possible explanation.'\nReasoning: The review specifies the assessment of risk of bias that may affect the cumulative evidence.\nResponse: [Yes]\n\nP16. Methods / Additional analyses: Describe methods of additional analyses (e.g., sensitivity or subgroup analyses, meta-regression), if done, indicating which were pre-specified.\nQuote: 'If sufficient data are identified, we anticipate undertaking subgroup analyses as follows: 1. degree of clinically measured symptomatic gastro-oesophageal reflux prior to gastrostomy surgery; 2. level of disability; 3. presence of underlying seizure disorders or pulmonary disease.'\nReasoning: The review describes the methods of additional analyses, if done.\nResponse: [Yes]\n\nP17. Results / Study selection: Give numbers of studies screened, assessed for eligibility, and included in the review, with reasons for exclusions at each stage, ideally with a flow diagram.\nQuote: 'We identified 1033 reports from the original electronic searches. Papers identified varied from reviews and editorials, to different study designs, both retrospective and prospective. The search update from June 2006 to June 2009 produced a further 476 reports but identified no trials meeting the inclusion. We revised the search strategies in 2012 and ran searches on 23 March 2012, which produced 385 reports, none of which met the inclusion criteria. Figure 1 shows a study flow diagram including the number of identified reports, duplicates and discarded studies.'\nReasoning: The review provides numbers of studies screened, assessed for eligibility, and included in the review, with reasons for exclusions at each stage, and includes a flow diagram.\nResponse: [Yes]\n\nP18. Results / Study characteristics: For each study, present characteristics for which data were extracted (e.g., study size, PICOS, follow-up period) and provide the citations.\nQuote: 'We identified no trials meeting the inclusion criteria.'\nReasoning: No studies were included, so no characteristics could be presented.\nResponse: [NA]\n\nP19. Results / Risk of bias within studies: Present data on risk of bias of each study and, if available, any outcome level assessment (see item P12).\nQuote: 'We identified no trials meeting the inclusion criteria.'\nReasoning: No studies were included, so no data on risk of bias could be presented.\nResponse: [NA]\n\nP20. Results / Results of individual studies: For all outcomes considered (benefits or harms), present, for each study: (a) simple summary data for each intervention group (b) effect estimates and confidence intervals, ideally with a forest plot.\nQuote: 'We identified no trials meeting the inclusion criteria.'\nReasoning: No studies were included, so no results of individual studies could be presented.\nResponse: [NA]\n\nP21. Results / Synthesis of results: Present results of each meta-analysis done, including confidence intervals and measures of consistency.\nQuote: 'We identified no trials meeting the inclusion criteria.'\nReasoning: No studies were included, so no results of meta-analysis could be presented.\nResponse: [NA]\n\nP22. Results / Risk of bias across studies: Present results of any assessment of risk of bias across studies (see Item P15).\nQuote: 'We identified no trials meeting the inclusion criteria.'\nReasoning: No studies were included, so no results of assessment of risk of bias across studies could be presented.\nResponse: [NA]\n\nP23. Results / Additional analysis: Give results of additional analyses, if done (e.g., sensitivity or subgroup analyses, meta-regression [see Item P16]).\nQuote: 'We identified no trials meeting the inclusion criteria.'\nReasoning: No studies were included, so no results of additional analyses could be presented.\nResponse: [NA]\n\nP24. Discussion / Summary of evidence: Summarize the main findings including the strength of evidence for each main outcome; consider their relevance to key groups (e.g., healthcare providers, users, and policy makers).\nQuote: 'The objective of this review was to compare the effectiveness of antireflux fundoplication surgery with the use of antireflux medications in children with neurological impairments undergoing"]],"container":"<table class=\"display\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th>Ref.<\/th>\n      <th>Author & Year<\/th>\n      <th>Reason for failed response (click to show LLM response)<\/th>\n      <th>Ultimately successful<\/th>\n      <th>LLM response<\/th>\n    <\/tr>\n  <\/thead>\n<\/table>","options":{"bPaginate":false,"dom":"ft","columnDefs":[{"targets":2,"render":"function(data, type, row, meta) { return '<a onclick=\"javascript:alert(`'+row[4]+'`)\" style=\"cursor: pointer\">' + data + '<\/a>' }"},{"targets":4,"visible":false}],"order":[],"autoWidth":false,"orderClasses":false}},"evals":["options.columnDefs.0.render"],"jsHooks":[]}</script>

Data Extraction Independent extraction of data was performed by N.E.S using predefined data fields. Data Synthesis Seven articles were included in the systematic review.

The aim of this study was to identify clinical evidence about the reliability of this technique in the recent literature. Methods: We performed a Medline search for articles published during the last 10 years, using the key words “varicocele,” “treatment,” and “adolescent.” As limits, we used last 10 years, adolescent, clinical trials, randomized controlled trials, meta-analysis, and multicenter retrospective and prospective studies. The results were investigated in recurrence and hydrocele formation. Results: We pooled 37 studies, but 26 of these were excluded because they were neither relevant nor concerned an adolescent population. Meta-analysis showed that there was no statistical difference between laparoscopic surgery and open surgery in recurrence rate and postoperative hydrocele rate. In the laparoscopic group, the incidence of recurrence was higher in the patients undergoing artery ligation compared to patients undergoing artery and venous ligation. Furthermore, a lower rate of postoperative hydrocele was recorded in patients undergoing dye injections before laparoscopic ligation. Conclusions: Meta-analysis and literature analysis showed that the results after laparoscopic varicocelectomy are comparable to other surgical procedures.

<h4>System prompt</h4>
<pre>
You are an expert in systematic reviews and are tasked to assess the methodological quality of a systematic review with the AMSTAR tool and its reporting quality with the PRISMA tool based on the full text of its publication. AMSTAR and PRISMA consist of the following items:

&lt;AMSTAR&gt;
A1. Was an 'a priori' design provided? The research question and inclusion criteria should be established before the conduct of the review. Note: Need to refer to a protocol, ethics approval, or pre-determined/a priori published research objectives to score a “yes.”
A2. Was there duplicate study selection and data extraction? There should be at least two independent data extractors and a consensus procedure for disagreements should be in place. Note: 2 people do study selection, 2 people do data extraction, consensus process or one person checks the other’s work.
A3. Was a comprehensive literature search performed? At least two electronic sources should be searched. The report must include years and databases used (e.g., Central, EMBASE, and MEDLINE). Key words and/or MESH terms must be stated and where feasible the search strategy should be provided. All searches should be supplemented by consulting current contents, reviews, textbooks, specialized registers, or experts in the particular field of study, and by reviewing the references in the studies found. Note: If at least 2 sources + one supplementary strategy used, select “yes” (Cochrane register/Central counts as 2 sources; a grey literature search counts as supplementary).
A4. Was the status of publication (i.e. grey literature) used as an inclusion criterion? The authors should state that they searched for reports regardless of their publication type. The authors should state whether or not they excluded any reports (from the systematic review), based on their publication status, language etc. Note: If review indicates that there was a search for “grey literature” or “unpublished literature,” indicate “yes.” SIGLE database, dissertations, conference proceedings, and trial registries are all considered grey for this purpose. If searching a source that contains both grey and non-grey, must specify that they were searching for grey/unpublished lit.
A5. Was a list of studies (included and excluded) provided? A list of included and excluded studies should be provided. Note: Acceptable if the excluded studies are referenced. If there is an electronic link to the list but the link is dead, select “no.”
A6. Were the characteristics of the included studies provided? In an aggregated form such as a table, data from the original studies should be provided on the participants, interventions and outcomes. The ranges of characteristics in all the studies analyzed e.g., age, race, sex, relevant socioeconomic data, disease status, duration, severity, or other diseases should be reported. Note: Acceptable if not in table format as long as they are described as above.
A7. Was the scientific quality of the included studies assessed and documented? 'A priori' methods of assessment should be provided (e.g., for effectiveness studies if the author(s) chose to include only randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled studies, or allocation concealment as inclusion criteria); for other types of studies alternative items will be relevant. Note: Can include use of a quality scoring tool or checklist, e.g., Jadad scale, risk of bias, sensitivity analysis, etc., or a description of quality items, with some kind of result for EACH study (“low” or “high” is fine, as long as it is clear which studies scored “low” and which scored “high”; a summary score/range for all studies is not acceptable).
A8. Was the scientific quality of the included studies used appropriately in formulating conclusions? The results of the methodological rigor and scientific quality should be considered in the analysis and the conclusions of the review, and explicitly stated in formulating recommendations. Note: Might say something such as “the results should be interpreted with caution due to poor quality of included studies.” Cannot score “yes” for this question if scored “no” for question A7.
A9. Were the methods used to combine the findings of studies appropriate? For the pooled results, a test should be done to ensure the studies were combinable, to assess their homogeneity (i.e., Chi-squared test for homogeneity, I2 ). If heterogeneity exists a random effects model should be used and/or the clinical appropriateness of combining should be taken into consideration (i.e., is it sensible to combine?). Note: Indicate “yes” if they mention or describe heterogeneity, i.e., if they explain that they cannot pool because of heterogeneity/variability between interventions.
A10. Was the likelihood of publication bias assessed? An assessment of publication bias should include a combination of graphical aids (e.g., funnel plot, other available tests) and/or statistical tests (e.g., Egger regression test, Hedges-Olken). Note: If no test values or funnel plot included, score “no”. Score “yes” if mentions that publication bias could not be assessed because there were fewer than 10 included studies.
A11. Was the conflict of interest included? Potential sources of support should be clearly acknowledged in both the systematic review and the included studies. Note: To get a “yes,” must indicate source of funding or support for the systematic review AND for each of the included studies..
