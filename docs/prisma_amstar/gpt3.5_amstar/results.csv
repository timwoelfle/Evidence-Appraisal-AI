[Yes] The text considers the scientific quality of the included studies and states that future prospective studies are required to further elucidate the issue.

A9. Were the methods used to combine the findings of studies appropriate? For the pooled results, a test should be done to ensure the studies were combinable, to assess their homogeneity (i.e., Chi-squared test for homogeneity, I2 ). If heterogeneity exists a random effects model should be used and/or the clinical appropriateness of combining should be taken into consideration (i.e., is it sensible to combine?). Note: Indicate “yes” if they mention or describe heterogeneity, i.e., if they explain that they cannot pool because of heterogeneity/variability between interventions.

- Not applicable <added>[NA]</added>. The text does not mention combining the findings of studies or assessing heterogeneity.

A10. Was the likelihood of publication bias assessed? An assessment of publication bias should include a combination of graphical aids (e.g., funnel plot, other available tests) and/or statistical tests (e.g., Egger regression test, Hedges-Olken). Note: If no test values or funnel plot included, score “no”. Score “yes” if mentions that publication bias could not be assessed because there were fewer than 10 included studies.

- Not applicable <added>[NA]</added>. The text does not mention assessing publication bias.

A11. Was the conflict of interest included? Potential sources of support should be clearly acknowledged in both the systematic review and the included studies. Note: To get a “yes,” must indicate source of funding or support for the systematic review AND for each of the included studies.

The ranges of characteristics in all the studies analyzed e.g., age, race, sex, relevant socioeconomic data, disease status, duration, severity, or other diseases should be reported. Note: Acceptable if not in table format as long as they are described as above.

- ""The overall numbers of study subjects managed in these publications were 71 infants, ranging from 1 to 60 newborns with long-gap EA per study. All infants had long-gap EA without TEF. Data about the initial gap length were reported in all studies with a mean of 5.4 cm (range 3–12.5 cm). No study reported data about the preoperative gap length. The time until an anastomosis could be achieved was reported in all studies with a mean of 14 ± 8.2 days. The follow-up time was 5 years (range 0.2–10 years).""

[Yes] The text provides the characteristics of the included studies, including the number of study subjects, the initial gap length, the time until anastomosis, and the follow-up time.

A7. Was the scientific quality of the included studies assessed and documented? 'A priori' methods of assessment should be provided (e.g., for effectiveness studies if the author(s) chose to include only randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled studies, or allocation concealment as inclusion criteria); for other types of studies alternative items will be relevant. Note: Can include use of a quality scoring tool or checklist, e.g., Jadad scale, risk of bias, sensitivity analysis, etc., or a description of quality items, with some kind of result for EACH study (“low” or “high” is fine, as long as it is clear which studies scored “low” and which scored “high”; a summary score/range for all studies is not acceptable).

- ""Our methodological assessment revealed that the studies ranged from poor to moderate quality.""

[Yes] The text states that a methodological assessment was performed and that the studies ranged from poor to moderate quality.

A8. Was the scientific quality of the included studies used appropriately in formulating conclusions? The results of the methodological rigor and scientific quality should be considered in the analysis and the conclusions of the review, and explicitly stated in formulating recommendations. Note: Might say something such as “the results should be interpreted with caution due to poor quality of included studies.” Cannot score “yes” for this question if scored “no” for question A7.

- ""The use of mechanical traction appears to be at least as effective as delayed primary anastomosis for the management of long-gap EA. Future prospective studies and the establishment of a prospective registry are required to further elucidate this issue.""

[Yes] The text considers the scientific quality of the included studies and states that future prospective studies are required to further elucidate the issue.

A9. Were the methods used to combine the findings of studies appropriate? For the pooled results, a test should be done to ensure the studies were combinable, to assess their homogeneity (i.e., Chi-squared test for homogeneity, I2 ). If heterogeneity exists a random effects model should be used and/or the clinical appropriateness of combining should be taken into consideration (i.e., is it sensible to combine?). Note: Indicate “yes” if they mention or describe heterogeneity, i.e., if they explain that they cannot pool because of heterogeneity/variability between interventions.

- Not applicable. The text does not mention combining the findings of studies or assessing heterogeneity.

A10. Was the likelihood of publication bias assessed? An assessment of publication bias should include a combination of graphical aids (e.g., funnel plot, other available tests) and/or statistical tests (e.g., Egger regression test, Hedges-Olken). Note: If no test values or funnel plot included, score “no”. Score “yes” if mentions that publication bias could not be assessed because there were fewer than 10 included studies.

- Not applicable. The text does not mention assessing publication bias.

A11. Was the conflict of interest included? Potential sources of support should be clearly acknowledged in both the systematic review and the included studies. Note: To get a “yes,” must indicate source of funding or support for the systematic review AND for each of the included studies.

- ""Conflict of Interest: None""

[Yes] The text clearly states that there is no conflict of interest.

Overall, the methodological quality of the systematic review is moderate. The review provides an a priori design, a comprehensive literature search, and the characteristics of the included studies. However, it does not mention duplicate study selection or data extraction, the assessment of publication bias, or the use of methods to combine the findings of studies. The scientific quality of the included studies is assessed and used appropriately in formulating conclusions. The review does not mention the conflict of interest."

- ""We also hand-searched the reference sections of included articles for additional relevant studies.""

Reasoning: The authors conducted a comprehensive literature search by searching multiple databases and hand-searching reference lists. They also provide details of the search terms used. Therefore, a comprehensive literature search was performed.
Answer: [Yes]

A4. Was the status of publication (i.e. grey literature) used as an inclusion criterion?
- No relevant quotes.

Reasoning: The text does not mention whether the status of publication was used as an inclusion criterion. Therefore, it is not clear if the authors searched for grey literature or unpublished literature.

- ""We performed full-text screening for these articles, excluding 17 that did not meet our criteria [7, 10, 22–36]. The remaining 31 studies comprised two SRs and 29 non-randomized studies; we quality assessed and summarized these studies (Table 1).""

Reasoning: The authors mention that they performed full-text screening and excluded 17 studies that did not meet their criteria. They also provide a summary table of the included studies. However, they do not explicitly state whether a list of excluded studies was provided. Therefore, it is unclear if a list of excluded studies was provided.
Answer: [No]

A6. Were the characteristics of the included studies provided?
- ""We quality assessed and summarized these studies (Table 1).""
- ""Table 1 Summaries of included studies, including quality scores""

Reasoning: The authors mention that they summarized the included studies in Table 1, which likely includes information on the characteristics of the studies. However, the full text does not provide specific details about the characteristics of the included studies. Therefore, it is unclear if the characteristics of the included studies were provided.

Reasoning: The authors clearly state that they used quality assessment tools (AMSTAR, Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool, and MINORS) to assess the scientific quality of the included studies. They also mention that two reviewers independently assessed each included study and reached a consensus on the quality assessment. Therefore, the scientific quality of the included studies was assessed and documented.
Answer: [Yes]

A8. Was the scientific quality of the included studies used appropriately in formulating conclusions?
- ""The results of our systematic review should, therefore, be interpreted with caution.""
- ""Therefore, we recommend that the surgeon’s preference and comfort level should dictate whether a one- or two-stage and open or laparoscopic procedure is undertaken until additional evidence becomes available.""
- ""Further studies—particularly RCTs—are needed to confirm the validity of these recommendations, and to improve the current surgical techniques for optimization of long-term outcomes.""

Reasoning: The authors acknowledge the limitations of the included studies and recommend caution in interpreting the results. They also mention the need for further studies, particularly RCTs, to confirm the validity of their recommendations. Therefore, the scientific quality of the included studies was appropriately used in formulating conclusions.
Answer: [Yes]

A9. Were the methods used to combine the findings of studies appropriate?
- No relevant quotes.

Reasoning: The text does not mention any methods used to combine the findings of studies. Additionally, since the authors state that meta-analysis was not possible due to heterogeneity of the data, it is unlikely that they used any methods to combine the findings. Therefore, it is not clear if the methods used to combine the findings of studies were appropriate.
Answer: [NA]

A10. Was the likelihood of publication bias assessed?
- No relevant quotes.

Reasoning: The text does not mention any assessment of publication bias. Additionally, since the authors state that they did not identify any RCTs published in the past 6 years, it is unlikely that they assessed publication bias. Therefore, it is not clear if the likelihood of publication bias was assessed.
Answer: [NA]

- ""We performed full-text screening for these articles, excluding 17 that did not meet our criteria [7, 10, 22–36]. The remaining 31 studies comprised two SRs and 29 non-randomized studies; we quality assessed and summarized these studies (Table 1).""

Reasoning: The authors mention that they performed full-text screening and excluded 17 studies that did not meet their criteria. They also provide a summary table of the included studies. However, they do not explicitly state whether a list of excluded studies was provided. Therefore, it is unclear if a list of excluded studies was provided.
Answer: [No]

A6. Were the characteristics of the included studies provided?
- ""We quality assessed and summarized these studies (Table 1).""
- ""Table 1 Summaries of included studies, including quality scores""

Reasoning: The authors mention that they summarized the included studies in Table 1, which likely includes information on the characteristics of the studies. However, the full text does not provide specific details about the characteristics of the included studies. Therefore, it is unclear if the characteristics of the included studies were provided.
Answer: [NA]

A7. Was the scientific quality of the included studies assessed and documented?
- ""We used AMSTAR [18] to assess the quality of all relevant systematic reviews (SRs).""
- ""Had we identified any randomized controlled trials (RCTs), we would have used the Cochrane ‘Risk of bias’ tool [19] to assess their quality.""
- ""We used MINORS [20] to assess the quality of all relevant non-randomized studies (comparative or non-comparative).""
- ""Two reviewers independently assessed each included study and compared the scores for each item on the applicable quality assessment tool to reach a consensus.""

Reasoning: The authors clearly state that they used quality assessment tools (AMSTAR, Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool, and MINORS) to assess the scientific quality of the included studies. They also mention that two reviewers independently assessed each included study and reached a consensus on the quality assessment. Therefore, the scientific quality of the included studies was assessed and documented.
Answer: [Yes]

A8. Was the scientific quality of the included studies used appropriately in formulating conclusions?
- ""The results of our systematic review should, therefore, be interpreted with caution.""
- ""Therefore, we recommend that the surgeon’s preference and comfort level should dictate whether a one- or two-stage and open or laparoscopic procedure is undertaken until additional evidence becomes available.""
- ""Further studies—particularly RCTs—are needed to confirm the validity of these recommendations, and to improve the current surgical techniques for optimization of long-term outcomes.""

Reasoning: The authors acknowledge the limitations of the included studies and recommend caution in interpreting the results. They also mention the need for further studies, particularly RCTs, to confirm the validity of their recommendations. Therefore, the scientific quality of the included studies was appropriately used in formulating conclusions.
Answer: [Yes]

A9. Were the methods used to combine the findings of studies appropriate?
- No relevant quotes.

Reasoning: The text does not mention any methods used to combine the findings of studies. Additionally, since the authors state that meta-analysis was not possible due to heterogeneity of the data, it is unlikely that they used any methods to combine the findings. Therefore, it is not clear if the methods used to combine the findings of studies were appropriate.
Answer: [NA]

A10. Was the likelihood of publication bias assessed?
- No relevant quotes.

Reasoning: The text does not mention any assessment of publication bias. Additionally, since the authors state that they did not identify any RCTs published in the past 6 years, it is unlikely that they assessed publication bias. Therefore, it is not clear if the likelihood of publication bias was assessed.
Answer: [NA]

A11. Was the conflict of interest included?
- ""The authors declare that they have no conflict of interest.""

Reasoning: The authors explicitly state that they have no conflict of interest. Therefore, the conflict of interest was included.

Note: 2 people do study selection, 2 people do data extraction, consensus process or one person checks the other’s work.

Quotes:
- ""Two of the authors (Hsu and Chang) independently did the literature search, quality assessment, and data extraction.""

Reasoning: The authors state that two authors independently conducted the literature search, quality assessment, and data extraction.

Answer: [Yes]

A3. Was a comprehensive literature search performed? At least two electronic sources should be searched. The report must include years and databases used (e.g., Central, EMBASE, and MEDLINE). Key words and/or MESH terms must be stated and where feasible the search strategy should be provided. All searches should be supplemented by consulting current contents, reviews, textbooks, specialized registers, or experts in the particular field of study, and by reviewing the references in the studies found. Note: If at least 2 sources + one supplementary strategy used, select “yes” (Cochrane register/Central counts as 2 sources; a grey literature search counts as supplementary).

Quotes:
- ""We searched PubMed® for comparative studies (from January 1990 to 2014 September) that compared the efficacy and safety of robotic versus open pyeloplasty.""
- ""We used the following keywords: robotic, pyeloplasty, ureteropelvic junction obstruction, children, and pediatric.""

Reasoning: The authors state that they performed a literature search in PubMed using specific keywords.

Answer: [Yes]

A4. Was the status of publication (i.e. grey literature) used as an inclusion criterion? The authors should state that they searched for reports regardless of their publication type. The authors should state whether or not they excluded any reports (from the systematic review), based on their publication status, language etc. Note: If review indicates that there was a search for “grey literature” or “unpublished literature,” indicate “yes.” SIGLE database, dissertations, conference proceedings, and trial registries are all considered grey for this purpose. If searching a source that contains both grey and non-grey, must specify that they were searching for grey/unpublished lit.

Quotes:
- No quotes provided.

Reasoning: The authors did not mention whether they searched for grey literature or unpublished literature.

Answer: [No]

A5. Was a list of studies (included and excluded) provided? A list of included and excluded studies should be provided. Note: Acceptable if the excluded studies are referenced. If there is an electronic link to the list but the link is dead, select “no.”

Quotes:
- ""Initial research yielded 104 abstracts, and a total of 102 abstracts were included for evaluation after duplicates were removed.""
- ""After excluding abstracts, which were not relevant to the topic, we retrieved full text of 15 studies for evaluation.""

Reasoning: The authors mention the number of abstracts included and excluded, but they do not provide a list of the included and excluded studies.

Answer: [No]

A6. Were the characteristics of the included studies provided? In an aggregated form such as a table, data from the original studies should be provided on the participants, interventions and outcomes. The ranges of characteristics in all the studies analyzed e.g., age, race, sex, relevant socioeconomic data, disease status, duration, severity, or other diseases should be reported. Note: Acceptable if not in table format as long as they are described as above.

Quotes:
- ""The demographic data of the patients in the 10 included trials are shown in Table 1.""
- ""The reported perioperative parameters in the enrolled studies are listed in Table 2.""

Reasoning: The authors provide tables that summarize the characteristics of the included studies.

Answer: [Yes]

A7. Was the scientific quality of the included studies assessed and documented? 'A priori' methods of assessment should be provided (e.g., for effectiveness studies if the author(s) chose to include only randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled studies, or allocation concealment as inclusion criteria); for other types of studies alternative items will be relevant. Note: Can include use of a quality scoring tool or checklist, e.g., Jadad scale, risk of bias, sensitivity analysis, etc., or a description of quality items, with some kind of result for EACH study (“low” or “high” is fine, as long as it is clear which studies scored “low” and which scored “high”; a summary score/range for all studies is not acceptable).

Quotes:
- No quotes provided.

Reasoning: The authors did not mention whether they assessed the scientific quality of the included studies.

Answer: [No]

A8. Was the scientific quality of the included studies used appropriately in formulating conclusions? The results of the methodological rigor and scientific quality should be considered in the analysis and the conclusions of the review, and explicitly stated in formulating recommendations. Note: Might say something such as “the results should be interpreted with caution due to poor quality of included studies.” Cannot score “yes” for this question if scored “no” for question A7.

Quotes:
- ""The current meta-analysis fails to validate robotic pyeloplasty as a standard of care in managing pediatric UPJO in the current status.""

Reasoning: The authors do not explicitly state whether they considered the scientific quality of the included studies in formulating their conclusions.

Answer: [No]

A9. Were the methods used to combine the findings of studies appropriate? For the pooled results, a test should be done to ensure the studies were combinable, to assess their homogeneity (i.e., Chi-squared test for homogeneity, I2 ). If heterogeneity exists a random effects model should be used and/or the clinical appropriateness of combining should be taken into consideration (i.e., is it sensible to combine?). Note: Indicate “yes” if they mention or describe heterogeneity, i.e., if they explain that they cannot pool because of heterogeneity/variability between interventions.

Quotes:
- ""Pooled analysis revealed significant heterogeneity (p = 0.008), and RP required longer time than OP by 64.26 min (95 % CI 37.58 to 90.93; p < 0.00001).""
- ""Pooled analysis revealed that hospital stay was significantly lower in the RP group by 0.95 days (95 % CI 0.38–1.52; p = 0.001).""
- ""Pooled analysis revealed that RP is associated with significantly higher hospital charge by 3.26 thousand USD (95 % CI 1.79–4.73 thousand USD; p < 0.00001).""
- ""Pooled data analysis showed that there was a significant higher overall complication rate in children undergoing RP (RR = 1.29, 95 CI 1.05–1.58, p = 0.001).""

Reasoning: The authors mention that they performed pooled analyses and report the results of these analyses.

Answer: [Yes]

A10. Was the likelihood of publication bias assessed? An assessment of publication bias should include a combination of graphical aids (e.g., funnel plot, other available tests) and/or statistical tests (e.g., Egger regression test, Hedges-Olken). Note: If no test values or funnel plot included, score “no”. Score “yes” if mentions that publication bias could not be assessed because there were fewer than 10 included studies.

Quotes:
- ""We analyzed the possible publication bias by generating funnel plots of the trials used for all of the evaluated comparisons of outcomes. No clear bias was apparent.""

Reasoning: The authors mention that they analyzed the possible publication bias by generating funnel plots, but they do not provide any results or conclusions from this analysis.

Answer: [No]

A11. Was the conflict of interest included? Potential sources of support should be clearly acknowledged in both the systematic review and the included studies. Note: To get a “yes,” must indicate source of funding or support for the systematic review AND for each of the included studies.

Quotes:
- ""The study is partly funded by Taipei Tzu Chi Hospital, Buddhist Tzu Chi Medical Foundation. TCRD-TPE-103-RT-7.""

Reasoning: The authors mention that the study was partly funded by Taipei Tzu Chi Hospital, Buddhist Tzu Chi Medical Foundation.

Reasoning: The authors mention the number of abstracts included and excluded, but they do not provide a list of the included and excluded studies.

Answer: [No]

A6. Were the characteristics of the included studies provided? In an aggregated form such as a table, data from the original studies should be provided on the participants, interventions and outcomes. The ranges of characteristics in all the studies analyzed e.g., age, race, sex, relevant socioeconomic data, disease status, duration, severity, or other diseases should be reported. Note: Acceptable if not in table format as long as they are described as above.

Quotes:
- ""The demographic data of the patients in the 10 included trials are shown in Table 1.""
- ""The reported perioperative parameters in the enrolled studies are listed in Table 2.""

Reasoning: The authors provide tables that summarize the characteristics of the included studies.

Answer: [Yes]

A7. Was the scientific quality of the included studies assessed and documented? 'A priori' methods of assessment should be provided (e.g., for effectiveness studies if the author(s) chose to include only randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled studies, or allocation concealment as inclusion criteria); for other types of studies alternative items will be relevant. Note: Can include use of a quality scoring tool or checklist, e.g., Jadad scale, risk of bias, sensitivity analysis, etc., or a description of quality items, with some kind of result for EACH study (“low” or “high” is fine, as long as it is clear which studies scored “low” and which scored “high”; a summary score/range for all studies is not acceptable).

Quotes:
- No quotes provided.

Reasoning: The authors did not mention whether they assessed the scientific quality of the included studies.

Answer: [No]

A8. Was the scientific quality of the included studies used appropriately in formulating conclusions? The results of the methodological rigor and scientific quality should be considered in the analysis and the conclusions of the review, and explicitly stated in formulating recommendations. Note: Might say something such as “the results should be interpreted with caution due to poor quality of included studies.” Cannot score “yes” for this question if scored “no” for question A7.

Quotes:
- ""The current meta-analysis fails to validate robotic pyeloplasty as a standard of care in managing pediatric UPJO in the current status.""

Reasoning: The authors do not explicitly state whether they considered the scientific quality of the included studies in formulating their conclusions.

Answer: [No]

A9. Were the methods used to combine the findings of studies appropriate? For the pooled results, a test should be done to ensure the studies were combinable, to assess their homogeneity (i.e., Chi-squared test for homogeneity, I2 ). If heterogeneity exists a random effects model should be used and/or the clinical appropriateness of combining should be taken into consideration (i.e., is it sensible to combine?). Note: Indicate “yes” if they mention or describe heterogeneity, i.e., if they explain that they cannot pool because of heterogeneity/variability between interventions.

Quotes:
- ""Pooled analysis revealed significant heterogeneity (p = 0.008), and RP required longer time than OP by 64.26 min (95 % CI 37.58 to 90.93; p < 0.00001).""
- ""Pooled analysis revealed that hospital stay was significantly lower in the RP group by 0.95 days (95 % CI 0.38–1.52; p = 0.001).""
- ""Pooled analysis revealed that RP is associated with significantly higher hospital charge by 3.26 thousand USD (95 % CI 1.79–4.73 thousand USD; p < 0.00001).""
- ""Pooled data analysis showed that there was a significant higher overall complication rate in children undergoing RP (RR = 1.29, 95 CI 1.05–1.58, p = 0.001).""

Reasoning: The authors mention that they performed pooled analyses and report the results of these analyses.

Answer: [Yes]

A10. Was the likelihood of publication bias assessed? An assessment of publication bias should include a combination of graphical aids (e.g., funnel plot, other available tests) and/or statistical tests (e.g., Egger regression test, Hedges-Olken). Note: If no test values or funnel plot included, score “no”. Score “yes” if mentions that publication bias could not be assessed because there were fewer than 10 included studies.

Quotes:
- ""We analyzed the possible publication bias by generating funnel plots of the trials used for all of the evaluated comparisons of outcomes. No clear bias was apparent.""

Reasoning: The authors mention that they analyzed the possible publication bias by generating funnel plots, but they do not provide any results or conclusions from this analysis.

Answer: [No]

A11. Was the conflict of interest included? Potential sources of support should be clearly acknowledged in both the systematic review and the included studies. Note: To get a “yes,” must indicate source of funding or support for the systematic review AND for each of the included studies.

Quotes:
- ""The study is partly funded by Taipei Tzu Chi Hospital, Buddhist Tzu Chi Medical Foundation. TCRD-TPE-103-RT-7.""

Reasoning: The authors mention that the study was partly funded by Taipei Tzu Chi Hospital, Buddhist Tzu Chi Medical Foundation.

Reasoning: The scientific quality of the included studies is mentioned, but it is not explicitly stated how it was used in formulating the conclusions.

Response: [No]

A9. Were the methods used to combine the findings of studies appropriate? For the pooled results, a test should be done to ensure the studies were combinable, to assess their homogeneity (i.e., Chi-squared test for homogeneity, I2 ). If heterogeneity exists a random effects model should be used and/or the clinical appropriateness of combining should be taken into consideration (i.e., is it sensible to combine?). Note: Indicate “yes” if they mention or describe heterogeneity, i.e., if they explain that they cannot pool because of heterogeneity/variability between interventions.

Quotes:
- No quotes provided.

Reasoning: No information is provided about the methods used to combine the findings of the studies.

Response: [NA]

A10. Was the likelihood of publication bias assessed? An assessment of publication bias should include a combination of graphical aids (e.g., funnel plot, other available tests) and/or statistical tests (e.g., Egger regression test, Hedges-Olken). Note: If no test values or funnel plot included, score “no”. Score “yes” if mentions that publication bias could not be assessed because there were fewer than 10 included studies.
