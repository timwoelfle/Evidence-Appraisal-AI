There is a paucity of higher-quality studies (e.g., long-term, prospective randomized trials) investigating the effect of age at orchiopexy on fertility and malignancy, possibly because of ethical concerns with randomization and the feasibility of long-term follow-up. Future research should address these issues, focusing especially on the effect of age at treatment on direct measures of fertility (i.e., time until conception of a live born child), for which existing research is particularly scarce.
