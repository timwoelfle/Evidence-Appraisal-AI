1. Eligibility:

   Quote: ""The inclusion criteria were being definitely diagnosed with MS and having records in the Society and the exclusion criteria having history of other psychiatric disorders including major depressive disorder (according to the medical records and the physician's examinations) or bipolar disorder (except for cognitive disorders by which MS is characterized), substance dependency, any neurological disorders, history of taking corticosteroids or the disease recurrence within the previous six months.""

   Explanation: The inclusion and exclusion criteria for the study are quite specific, but they do not seem to deviate significantly from what would be used in usual care. The criteria are based on medical records and physician examinations, which suggests that they are evidence-based and clinically relevant. However, the criteria are not overly restrictive, as they allow for a range of MS patients to be included in the study. Overall, the eligibility criteria seem to be fairly pragmatic, with a score of <added-score-prefix>Score: [4]</added-score-prefix>.

2. Recruitment:

   Quote: ""Because the patients were not hospitalized and regularly referred to the Association, to follow randomized assignment, we decided to run the sampling within two consecutive months until we enrolled an adequate number of participants. Accordingly, 70 numbers, equal to the number of people required in each group, were developed and the numbers 1e70 were randomly assigned to two groups: experimental and control. After eligible patients referred to the Association, a number was randomly assigned to each patient according to his/her referring time and the patients were assigned to the two groups.""

   Explanation: The recruitment process for the study appears to be quite pragmatic. The researchers used a simple randomization method to assign patients to the experimental or control group, which is a common and straightforward approach. The fact that patients were not hospitalized and regularly referred to the Association suggests that the recruitment process may have been similar to what would be used in usual care. However, it is unclear whether any extra effort was made to recruit participants beyond what would be typical in usual care. Therefore, a score of <added-score-prefix>Score: [3]</added-score-prefix> is appropriate for the recruitment domain.

3. Setting:

   Quote: ""The intervention was implemented within two days a week. For the control group, a routine protocol was conducted. For blinding, the patients of the control group referred to the Society on certain days of week and those of the experimental on other days.""

   Explanation: The setting of the study appears to be quite pragmatic, as the intervention was implemented in a community-based setting that is similar to what would be used in usual care. The researchers used a simple blinding method to ensure that the control group was not aware of the intervention, which is a common and straightforward approach. However, it is unclear whether the setting of the study differed significantly from the usual care setting. Therefore, a score of <added-score-prefix>Score: [4]</added-score-prefix> is appropriate for the setting domain.

4. Organization:

   Quote: ""The intervention consisted of: defining depression, stress, anxiety, and their symptoms, defining happiness, and explaining its necessity, reviewing the results of previous studies on happiness (the first session); the technique of increasing physical activity, the technique of being productive, and doing useful and meaningful things (the second session); the principles of planning and better organization–the technique of removing concerns, the technique of reducing expectations and wishes (the third session); the technique of enhancing creativity, the technique of living at present (the fourth session); the technique of increasing social relationships, the technique of being the real self (the fifth session); the technique of increasing intimacy as the most important source of happiness–the technique of giving priority to happiness and making it invaluable (the sixth session); the technique of expressing emotions, the technique of enhancing optimism (the seventh session); reviewing all the techniques taught, administering post-test (the eighth session).""

   Explanation: The organization of the intervention appears to be quite pragmatic, as it is based on a structured curriculum that is designed to teach patients specific skills and techniques for managing their depression, stress, anxiety, and fatigue. The intervention is delivered in eight sessions, which is a reasonable length of time for a behavioral intervention. The intervention is also delivered in a group format, which is a common and cost-effective approach. However, it is unclear whether the organization of the intervention differs significantly from what would be used in usual care. Therefore, a score of <added-score-prefix>Score: [4]</added-score-prefix> is appropriate for the organization domain.

6. Flexibility (adherence):

   Quote: ""At completion of the training program, all happy techniques were briefly reviewed with the participants, the participants were asked some questions about their current happiness and optimism levels, and their questions, if any, were answered. Then, DASS-21 and Piper Scale were administered to the participants.""

   Explanation: The flexibility of adherence to the intervention appears to be quite pragmatic, as the researchers did not exclude any participants based on their adherence to the intervention. The researchers also reviewed the happy techniques with the participants at the end of the training program and asked them about their current happiness and optimism levels. This suggests that the researchers were flexible in their approach to adherence and were willing to work with participants to ensure that they were able to benefit from the intervention. However, it is unclear whether the flexibility of adherence differed significantly from what would be used in usual care. Therefore, a score of <added-score-prefix>Score: [4]</added-score-prefix> is appropriate for the flexibility (adherence) domain.

7. Follow-up:

   Quote: ""At completion of the training program, all happy techniques were briefly reviewed with the participants, the participants were asked some questions about their current happiness and optimism levels, and their questions, if any, were answered. Then, DASS-21 and Piper Scale were administered to the participants. The participants were acknowledged for their participation in the study and the follow-up session was decided to be held three months later. Moreover, to investigate the efficacy of the FHM, the DASS-21 and Piper Standard Scale were administered to the experimental group in the follow-up session.""

   Explanation: The follow-up process for the study appears to be quite pragmatic, as the researchers administered the DASS-21 and Piper Standard Scale to the experimental group in a follow-up session that was held three months after the completion of the training program. This is a reasonable length of time for a follow-up period, as it allows for enough time to assess the long-term effects of the intervention. The fact that the researchers administered the same measures in the follow-up session that were used in the initial assessment also suggests that the follow-up process is consistent with what would be used in usual care. Therefore, a score of <added-score-prefix>Score: [4]</added-score-prefix> is appropriate for the follow-up domain.

8. Primary outcome:

   Quote: ""The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of Fordyce Happiness Model (FHM) on depression, stress, anxiety, and fatigue in MS patients.""

   Explanation: The primary outcome of the study appears to be quite pragmatic, as it is focused on depression, stress, anxiety, and fatigue, which are common symptoms experienced by MS patients. The fact that the researchers used validated measures (DASS-21 and Piper Standard Scale) to assess these symptoms also suggests that the primary outcome is consistent with what would be used in usual care. However, it is unclear whether the primary outcome differs significantly from what would be used in usual care. Therefore, a score of <added-score-prefix>Score: [4]</added-score-prefix> is appropriate for the primary outcome domain.

9. Primary analysis:

   Quote: ""The data obtained before and after conduction of the program were analyzed by chi-square test, Mann-Whitney, covariance statistics, repeated measures ANOVA, and independent t-test in SPSS 18.""

   Explanation: The primary analysis of the study appears to be quite pragmatic, as the researchers used a range of statistical tests to analyze the data. The fact that the researchers used SPSS 18, which is a commonly used statistical software package, also suggests that the primary analysis is consistent with what would be used in usual care. However, it is unclear whether the primary analysis differs significantly from what would be used in usual care. Therefore, a score of <added-score-prefix>Score: [4]</added-score-prefix> is appropriate for the primary analysis domain.

Overall, the PRECIS-2 domains for this study appear to be fairly pragmatic, with scores ranging from 3 to 5. The eligibility, setting, and primary outcome domains received the highest scores, while the recruitment and primary analysis domains received the lowest scores. This suggests that the study is generally consistent with what would be used in usual care, but there may be some areas where the study could be improved to make it more pragmatic. For example, the researchers could consider using more convenient recruitment methods or using more straightforward statistical analyses to make the study more pragmatic.","

[Page 1621]
   - ""Eligibility was confirmed by project nurses based on patients’ medical records. Patients gave informed written consent prior to inclusion."" [Page 1621]

2. The eligibility criteria for this trial are relatively pragmatic, as they only require a recent diagnosis of RRMS and no relapses or medication changes in the past 8 weeks. The age range is also quite broad, which increases the generalizability of the trial. However, the fact that patients were recruited through MS clinics and the Danish MS Society may introduce some selection bias, as these patients may be more motivated or have more severe symptoms than the general MS population.

However, the trial is still relatively pragmatic overall, as it focuses on important outcomes in MS research and involves a consistent exercise intervention that is tailored to individual patients and progressively overloaded over time."

1. Eligibility:

   Quote: ""All participants were recruited among six MS rehabilitation centers within the region of Castilla y Le´on (Spain)... After a medical evaluation that confirmed patients’ aptitude and absence of contraindications to carry out the procedures involved in the study, subjects signed a written informed consent form to participate.""

   Quote: ""Participants were randomly assigned to two different groups, the exercise group (EG) or the control group (CG). The EG, which included 16 women and 14 men (49.6 ± 11.0 yr), performed 12 weeks of resistance training followed by a detraining period where resistance exercise or other structured physical activity was avoided. The CG, which did not follow any resistance training during the study period, included 7 women and 5 men (46.2 ± 7.5 yr).""

   Reasoning: The eligibility criteria for this trial are similar to those used in usual care, with participants being recruited from MS rehabilitation centers and undergoing a medical evaluation to confirm their aptitude for the study. The random assignment of participants to either the exercise or control group also increases the pragmatism of the trial. However, the exclusion of participants with contraindications to the study procedures may limit the generalizability of the trial to a wider population of MS patients. Score: [4]

2. Recruitment:

   Quote: ""After a group meeting where the details of the investigation were described to the patients, including possible risks and discomfort associated to the intervention, a formal invitation to take part in the study was offered.""

   Reasoning: The recruitment process for this trial is similar to that used in usual care, with patients being informed about the study and invited to participate. However, the use of a group meeting to provide information about the study may limit the pragmatism of the trial, as this approach may not be feasible in a usual care setting. Score: [3]

3. Setting:

   Quote: ""The EG performed 12 weeks of resistance training followed by a detraining period where resistance exercise or other structured physical activity was avoided. The CG did not follow any resistance training during the study period.""

   Reasoning: The setting of this trial is similar to that used in usual care, with participants performing resistance training or not, depending on their group assignment. However, the use of a controlled research setting may limit the pragmatism of the trial, as it may not reflect the variability and unpredictability of a usual care setting. Score: [3]

4. Organization:

   Quote: ""All testing procedures were selected according to previous studies... Each participant completed the tests in a single session. Subjects were individually informed about the test procedures before initiating them.""

   Reasoning: The organization of this trial is similar to that used in usual care, with participants undergoing testing procedures that are selected based on previous studies. The individualized nature of the testing procedures also increases the pragmatism of the trial. However, the use of a controlled research setting may limit the generalizability of the trial to a wider population of MS patients. Score: [4]

5. Flexibility (delivery):

   Quote: ""Subjects performed coupled concentric-eccentric bilateral seated knee extension training using a weight stack machine... The patients were continuously supervised by physical therapists.""

   Reasoning: The flexibility in the delivery of the intervention in this trial is similar to that used in usual care, with participants performing resistance training using a weight stack machine and being supervised by physical therapists. However, the use of a controlled research setting may limit the pragmatism of the trial, as it may not reflect the variability and unpredictability of a usual care setting. Score: [4]

6. Flexibility (adherence):

   Quote: ""Adherence to the training intervention (e.g. EG) averaged 22.9 ± 1.5 sessions from a total of 24 planned sessions... All participants from the EG completed more than 75% of the sessions included in the resistance training program.""

   Reasoning: The flexibility in adherence to the intervention in this trial is similar to that used in usual care, with participants being encouraged to complete as many sessions as possible. The high adherence rate of the EG also increases the pragmatism of the trial. However, the use of a controlled research setting may limit the generalizability of the trial to a wider population of MS patients. Score: [4]

7. Follow-up:

   Quote: ""Testing was performed on three different occasions: before (week 0) and after (week 12) the training program, and after the detraining period (week 24).""

   Reasoning: The follow-up procedures in this trial are similar to those used in usual care, with participants undergoing testing at multiple time points. However, the use of a controlled research setting may limit the pragmatism of the trial, as it may not reflect the variability and unpredictability of a usual care setting. Score: [4]

8. Primary outcome:

   Quote: ""The EG increased MVIC and muscle power after the training period, although the training did not affect muscle endurance. After 12 weeks of detraining, MVIC returned to pre-training values but muscle power was still greater than pre-training values in the EG.""

   Reasoning: The primary outcome of this trial is relevant to participants, as it demonstrates the effects of resistance training and detraining on muscle strength and power in MS patients. However, the use of a controlled research setting may limit the pragmatism of the trial, as it may not reflect the variability and unpredictability of a usual care setting. Score: [4]

9. Primary analysis:

   Quote: ""Two-way ANOVA with repeated measurements for group and time... Bonferroni post-hoc comparisons.""

   - ""a month after t2 a follow up measurement was performed (t3) for the intervention group.""

14. The follow-up process for this trial is pragmatic, as it involves measuring the outcomes at multiple time points and including a follow-up measurement for the intervention group. Score: [5]

15. Primary outcome:
   - ""the main outcome measures were the ara test and the NHPt.""
   - ""the ara test was chosen as the main outcome measure because all the patients were able to perform the total test compared to the WMFt test where the patient has to stand up for some exercises - impossible for wheelchair bound patients.""

16. The primary outcome for this trial is pragmatic, as it involves measuring the arm/hand function using the ara test and the NHPt. The ara test was chosen as the main outcome measure because it is more feasible for wheelchair-bound patients, which is a common and necessary approach in clinical trials. Score: [5]

17. Primary analysis:
   - ""the main research question in this validation trial clinical assessment of the HeLLODOc tele-rehabilitation service was: is the use of the H-caD system for one month at least as good as usual care for the arm/hand function in stroke, tBI and MS patients?""
   - ""the hypothesis is that the H-caD system is at least as effective as the usual care for arm/hand function, measured with outcome measures for arm/hand function, given to the stroke, tBI and MS patients when they are living at home.""

18. The primary analysis for this trial is pragmatic, as it involves comparing the intervention to usual care using outcome measures for arm/hand function. The hypothesis is focused on maintaining the arm/hand functioning, which is a common and necessary approach in clinical trials. Score: [5]"

1. Eligibility:
   - ""Inclusion criteria were: 1) having a definite diagnosis of MS from a neurologist; 2) being within 5 years of receiving a diagnosis of MS; 3) scoring at least 10 on the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) [26]; 4) not currently undertaking other psychological treatment for depressive or anxiety symptoms for the length of participation in the current trial; 5) speak English fluently; 6) no current or lifetime diagnosis of psychosis; 7) no current substance dependency; 8) no gross cognitive impairment; and 9) no changes to medications prior and during in-volvement in the trial.""
   - ""Two studies suggest that up to 36% of MS patients continue to have high levels of depressive and anxiety symptoms in the first two years after a diagnosis [11] and are at greater risk of suicide [17].""
   - ""Individuals may also be adapting to the MS diagnosis and symptoms, the burden of uncertainty and dealing with the loss of physical and cognitive functioning, changes in interpersonal relationships, social and work roles and social support and a reduction in positively reinforcing activities.""

   The inclusion criteria are relatively broad and inclusive, with the exception of the requirement for a BDI-II score of at least 10. This suggests that the trial is not overly selective in terms of participant eligibility, which is consistent with a pragmatic approach. However, the fact that participants are required to have a definite diagnosis of MS from a neurologist and to be within 5 years of receiving the diagnosis suggests that the trial is not completely unrestricted in terms of eligibility. The inclusion of individuals who are adapting to the MS diagnosis and symptoms, as well as those who are at greater risk of suicide, also suggests a more pragmatic approach. Overall, the eligibility domain appears to be relatively pragmatic, with a score of <added-score-prefix>Score: [4]</added-score-prefix>.

   The recruitment process appears to be relatively pragmatic, with participants being recruited through neurologists, advertisements on MS related websites, and local press releases. The participation rate of 64% also suggests that the recruitment process was relatively successful. However, the fact that 17 out of 47 screened participants were not eligible for the trial suggests that there may have been some level of selection bias in the recruitment process.

1. Eligibility:

[1]
   - ""Candidates were excluded from the study if active disease was identified at baseline per clinical (presence of a relapse during the previous 30 days) and/or MRI evaluation (active gadolinium (Gd)-enhancing lesions)."" [1]

   The eligibility criteria for this trial are relatively pragmatic, as they include patients who have been on natalizumab therapy for at least 24 months and are considering discontinuation. The exclusion criteria are also relatively pragmatic, as they only exclude patients with active disease at baseline. However, the trial does not explicitly state whether the participants are similar to those who would receive this intervention if it was part of usual care. Therefore, it is difficult to determine the exact level of pragmatism in this domain.

1. Primary outcome:
   - ""The primary outcome was the proportion of participants who reported reaching ≥150 minutes of MVPA per week. Physical activity was assessed using three validated questionnaires: Phone-FITT, the Physical Activity Scale for the Elderly (PASE), and the Community Healthy Activities Model Program for Seniors (CHAMPS). The primary outcome measure was the CHAMPS questionnaire."" [Page 3]

2. The primary outcome of this trial is relatively pragmatic, as it uses a validated questionnaire to assess physical activity, which is similar to the methods used in usual care. However, the full text does not provide information on the number of primary outcomes used or the similarity of the primary outcomes to those used in usual care, making it difficult to accurately assess the pragmatism of the primary outcome domain.

1. Primary analysis:
   - ""Comparisons between treatment arms were made using random-effects regression models to allow for clustering between practices. Linear models were used for continuous outcome variables, logistic models for binary outcome variables, and negative binomial models for data on rate of falls. The CHAMPS score measuring minutes of physical activity followed a lognormal distribution with many zeros, and was therefore transformed to log 
e
(CHAMPSscore+1)."" [Page 3]

2. The primary analysis of this trial is relatively pragmatic, as it uses random-effects regression models to allow for clustering between practices, which is similar to the methods used in usual care.

1. Eligibility:
   - ""Patients were eligible to participate if they were: • community dwelling aged ≥65 years; • independently mobile (with or without a walking aid); and • physically able to take part in group exercise."" [Page 2]
   - ""Attempts were made to exclude those who were already exercising at, or above, the target level through a pre-assessment screening telephone call."" [Page 2]

2. The eligibility criteria for this trial are quite pragmatic, as they are similar to those used in usual care. The trial attempts to exclude those who are already exercising at or above the target level, which is also a pragmatic approach. However, the full text does not provide information on the number of exclusion criteria or the specificity of these criteria, making it difficult to accurately assess the pragmatism of the eligibility domain.

1. Recruitment:
   - ""Practices were recruited with assistance from Primary Care Research Networks for London, Derby, and Nottingham. Patients aged ≥65 years were identified by searches of computerised medical records and invited to participate by letter from their GP."" [Page 2]

2. The recruitment process for this trial is relatively pragmatic, as it involves recruiting practices with assistance from Primary Care Research Networks and inviting patients to participate by letter from their GP. This approach is similar to how patients might be recruited for usual care interventions. However, the full text does not provide information on the number of recruitment methods used or the intensity of recruitment efforts, making it difficult to accurately assess the pragmatism of the recruitment domain.

1. Setting:
   - ""The interventions were the home-based Otago Exercise Programme (OEP), and a group-based exercise programme called Falls Management Exercise (FaME). The FaME intervention took place in a group once a week and included exercises to be carried out at home, unsupervised, twice weekly. The OEP was undertaken at home, unsupervised, and comprised exercises to be done three times per week."" [Page 2]

2. The setting of this trial is relatively pragmatic, as the interventions are delivered in a group setting and at home, which are similar to the settings used in usual care. However, the full text does not provide information on the number of settings used or the similarity of the settings to those used in usual care, making it difficult to accurately assess the pragmatism of the setting domain.

1. Organisation:
   - ""Volunteer peer mentors supported participants in the OEP arm, and weekly FaME classes were run in local venues by postural stability instructors trained to work with older people. Both interventions were delivered for 24 weeks."" [Page 2]

2. The organisation of this trial is relatively pragmatic, as it involves using volunteer peer mentors and postural stability instructors trained to work with older people, which are similar to the resources used in usual care. However, the full text does not provide information on the number of resources used or the similarity of the resources to those used in usual care, making it difficult to accurately assess the pragmatism of the organisation domain.

1. Flexibility (delivery):
   - ""The programmes included the following progression: • OEP — ankle weights and hand holds; and • FaME — resistance bands and hand holds, plus a move to more dynamic balance work and floor work with postural stability instructors."" [Page 2]

2. The flexibility of the delivery of this trial is relatively pragmatic, as it includes progression in the interventions, which is similar to the flexibility used in usual care. However, the full text does not provide information on the number of delivery methods used or the similarity of the delivery methods to those used in usual care, making it difficult to accurately assess the pragmatism of the flexibility (delivery) domain.

3. Score: [4]


1. Flexibility (adherence):
   - ""Adherence was defined as (minutes spent exercising/intended minutes) 100%, where patients with values exceeding 75% were regarded as ‘adherent’."" [Page 4]

2. The flexibility of adherence in this trial is relatively pragmatic, as it allows for some flexibility in the amount of exercise completed by participants. However, the full text does not provide information on the number of adherence methods used or the similarity of the adherence methods to those used in usual care, making it difficult to accurately assess the pragmatism of the flexibility (adherence) domain.
