<p><i>Minor score formatting issues fixed during extraction:
‘not-applicable-without-score’</i></p>
<p><i><span style="border-bottom: 1px dashed black;">8 quote(s) from
publication full text</span> (mean similarity 100%)</i></p>
<pre>
Eligibility:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Pregnant women were eligible if they were to undergo their first or second caesarean section through a planned transverse abdominal incision.&quot;</span> [1]
- Score: [4] The eligibility criteria are somewhat pragmatic as they include pregnant women who are undergoing their first or second caesarean section, which is similar to usual care. However, the criteria exclude women who have a clear indication for a particular surgical technique or material, which is more explanatory.

Recruitment:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The trial was discussed with all eligible women and their partners and relatives as appropriate. If the woman agreed to participate, she signed a formal consent form or used the method of recording consent permitted in that setting.&quot;</span> [2]
- Score: [5] The recruitment process seems very pragmatic as it involves discussing the trial with eligible women during their care and obtaining informed consent, which is similar to usual care.

Setting:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;CORONIS was undertaken at 19 sites in Argentina, Chile, Ghana, India, Kenya, Pakistan, and Sudan.&quot;</span> [2]
- Score: [4] The trial was conducted at multiple sites in different countries, which is somewhat pragmatic. However, the trial was not conducted in a wide range of settings and was limited to specific countries, which is more explanatory.

Organisation:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;All investigators, surgeons, and participants were unmasked to treatment allocation.&quot;</span> [2]
- Score: [5] The trial was conducted in an unmasked manner, which is similar to usual care.

Flexibility (delivery):
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;All non-allocated surgical elements and all other aspects of the caesarean section procedure were undertaken at the discretion of the surgeon.&quot;</span> [2]
- Score: [5] The surgeons had discretion in performing the non-allocated surgical elements, which is similar to usual care.

Flexibility (adherence):
- Not applicable. <span style='background-color: #ff9e81' title='Added response during extraction'>Score: [NA]</span> The full text does not provide information on adherence to the intervention.

Follow-up:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Data were collected at trial entry, immediately after surgery, at hospital discharge, and at about 6 weeks after delivery.&quot;</span> [2]
- Score: [5] The follow-up schedule includes data collection at multiple time points, including the 6-week follow-up visit, which is similar to usual care.

Primary outcome:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;There were no statistically significant differences within any of the intervention pairs for the primary outcome.&quot;</span> [2]
- Score: [5] The trial found no statistically significant differences in the primary outcome, suggesting that the trial's primary outcome is relevant to participants.

Primary analysis:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Women were analysed in the groups into which they were allocated.&quot;</span> [2]
- Score: [5] The primary analysis included all women in the groups to which they were allocated, which is similar to an intention-to-treat analysis and is pragmatic.

Overall, the trial seems to have a pragmatic design, with some domains leaning more towards explanatory. The eligibility criteria, recruitment process, flexibility in delivery, and primary analysis are all pragmatic. However, the setting and organisation of the trial are somewhat explanatory. The trial does not provide enough information to assess the flexibility in adherence domain.</pre>

<pre>
Eligibility:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Patients with type 2 diabetes (n=264) selected by a self-administered questionnaire aimed at measuring emotional distress and diabetes-related reduced daily functioning.&quot;</span> [1]
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The eligibility criteria changed from having a mild to moderate depression towards suffering from both emotional distress and interference in their daily functioning due to the burden of diabetes.&quot;</span> [1]
- Score: [4] The eligibility criteria for this trial are somewhat pragmatic, as they focus on patients with emotional distress and reduced daily functioning related to diabetes. However, the criteria are still somewhat explanatory as they exclude patients with mild to moderate depression.

Recruitment:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;All the family practices of one regional organisation of GPs (a so-called ‘care group’) in the South of the Netherlands were eligible to participate in the study.&quot;</span> [2]
- <span title='Moderate quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 79.4%):

From all 1805 patients who participated in the screening, 357 (20%) met the detection criteria and were invited to take part in the trial. A total of 264 patients (74%) gave informed consent to participate in the tria' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ff9e81'>&quot;From the 3822 patients with diabetes who were sent a screening questionnaire, 264 patients gave informed consent to participate in the trial.&quot;</span> [2]
- Score: [4] The recruitment methods used in this trial are somewhat pragmatic, as they involve all eligible family practices and a large number of patients. However, the trial did not use targeted invitation letters or other methods to actively recruit participants, which would have made it more pragmatic.

Setting:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;A regional care group in the Netherlands consisting of 77 family practices.&quot;</span> [2]
- Score: [4] The setting of this trial is somewhat pragmatic, as it involves a regional care group with multiple family practices. However, it is not clear if the trial was conducted in other types of settings, such as academic or specialized trial centers.

Organisation:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;PNs in the intervention arm were trained in SMS, whereas PNs in the control arm provided usual diabetes care, conforming to the Dutch guidelines.&quot;</span> [2]
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Financial reimbursement for the extra time spent on SMS was added to the bundled payment arrangement for diabetes care.&quot;</span> [2]
- Score: [4] The organization of care delivery in this trial is somewhat pragmatic, as it involves training practice nurses in SMS and providing financial reimbursement for the extra time spent on SMS. However, it is not clear if there were any other changes to the organization of care delivery in the intervention arm.

Flexibility (delivery):
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;PNs supported patients in the processes of defining problems and finding solutions themselves, by applying problem-solving and reattribution techniques.&quot;</span> [2]
- Score: [4] The flexibility in how the intervention is delivered in this trial is somewhat pragmatic, as it involves supporting patients in problem-solving and reattribution techniques. However, it is not clear if there were any strict protocols or measures to improve compliance.

Flexibility (adherence):
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Patients who experienced problems of daily functioning and emotional health problems were offered consultations for SMS.&quot;</span> [2]
- Score: [4] The flexibility in how participants must adhere to the intervention in this trial is somewhat pragmatic, as it involves offering consultations for SMS to patients who experience problems. However, it is not clear if there were any strict protocols or measures to improve adherence.

Follow-up:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Outcomes were measured at baseline and at 4-month and 12-month follow-ups.&quot;</span> [2]
- Score: [5] The intensity of measurement and follow-up in this trial is very pragmatic, as it involves measuring outcomes at multiple time points similar to usual care.

Primary outcome:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The primary outcome measure was a dichotomised score on a Visual Analogue Scale that measured the perceived effect of diabetes on daily functioning.&quot;</span> [2]
- Score: [5] The primary outcome measure in this trial is very pragmatic, as it directly measures the perceived effect of diabetes on daily functioning.

Primary analysis:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Analyses were performed on an intention-to-treat basis.&quot;</span> [2]
- Score: [5] The primary analysis in this trial is very pragmatic, as it includes all available data on an intention-to-treat basis.

Overall, this trial has a somewhat pragmatic design, with scores ranging from 4 to 5 in most domains. However, there is some lack of information in certain domains, such as flexibility in delivery and adherence, which prevents a complete assessment.</pre>

<pre>
Eligibility:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;In the case of asthma, for example, the eligibility criteria in most such trials exclude an estimated 95% of patients with a current diagnosis of asthma, including smokers and those who have “insufficient” bronchodilator reversibility or impaired pulmonary function.&quot;</span> [Explanatory]
2. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;We designed these two pragmatic trials to maximize external validity (applicability or generalizability), with the goal of studying a heterogeneous real-world population.&quot;</span> [Pragmatic]
Score: [3]

Recruitment:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Patients were responsible for obtaining their own medications, as would occur in real life.&quot;</span> [Pragmatic]
2. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;We considered but rejected the addition of a placebo group when designing the study, since we believe it would have been unethical to assign patients to placebo for 2 years.&quot;</span> [Pragmatic]
Score: [4]

Setting:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Both trials were conducted in accordance with the protocol.&quot;</span> [Explanatory]
2. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The study was powered for equivalence in the MiniAQLQ score, with the equivalence boundary set at a 95% CI of less than 0.3 for the MiniAQLQ score (i.e., equivalence was declared if the 95% CI was wholly included between –0.3 and 0.3).&quot;</span> [Explanatory]
Score: [2]

Organisation:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The primary funder and sponsor (National Coordinating Centre for Health Technology Assessment U.K.) provided input with regard to the study design through its commissioning and monitoring brief but played no role in data collection, analysis, or interpretation; the writing of the article; or the decision to submit the article for publication.&quot;</span> [Pragmatic]
2. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Practice staffs were asked to provide each patient with a written individualized asthma-action plan.&quot;</span> [Pragmatic]
Score: [4]

Flexibility (delivery):
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Choices of individual drugs and devices were made according to normal clinical practice and British asthma guidelines.&quot;</span> [Pragmatic]
2. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The protocol discouraged substantial treatment changes between randomization and the 2-month visit.&quot;</span> [Pragmatic]
Score: [4]

Flexibility (adherence):
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Adherence to an LTRA was better than it was to the other drugs in both trials.&quot;</span> [Pragmatic]
2. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Although such poor and differential adherence potentially reduces assay sensitivity (particularly when coupled with treatment crossover), thus biasing results toward equivalence, both poor and differential adherence rates are realities of real-world prescribing and thus part of the treatment effect.&quot;</span> [Pragmatic]
Score: [5]

Follow-up:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Data collection and statistical analyses were performed by study personnel who were unaware of the treatment assignments; questionnaire-based data were collected under blinded conditions, and routine practice data (including a history of exacerbations) were extracted with the use of dedicated software.&quot;</span> [Pragmatic]
2. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Data for asthma-related quality of life and asthma control were available over a period of 21 months for 95% and 96% of the patients in the first-line controller and add-on therapy trials, respectively, which are completion rates higher than those in most long-term asthma-therapy trials.&quot;</span> [Pragmatic]
Score: [5]

Primary outcome:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Mean improvements over a period of 2 years in both the first-line controller and the add-on therapy trials were substantially greater than the MID for questionnaire scores measuring asthma-related quality of life and asthma control.&quot;</span> [Pragmatic]
2. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;For patients receiving an LTRA or an inhaled glucocorticoid as first-line controller therapy, MiniAQLQ scores were equivalent at 2 months, but at 2 years, these scores did not meet our prespecified criterion for equivalence, since the lower boundary of the 95% CI was –0.35.&quot;</span> [Explanatory]
Score: [3]

Primary analysis:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The primary effectiveness analysis was an intention-to-treat analysis of the MiniAQLQ score at 2 months (the primary time point) and at 2 years.&quot;</span> [Pragmatic]
2. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Multiple imputation was used where data were missing.&quot;</span> [Pragmatic]

<pre>
Eligibility:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Patient selection criteria were having a diagnosis of moderate-to-severe COPD (a Body mass index, Airflow obstruction, dyspnoea and Exercise capacity [BODE] index score of 3–7) according to international guidelines and having been clinically stable for the previous 4 weeks.&quot;</span> <span style='background-color: #ffe9e2' title='Moved squared brackets during extraction'>Score: [4]</span> The eligibility criteria for this trial are relatively broad, allowing for the inclusion of patients with moderate-to-severe COPD who are clinically stable. However, the use of the BODE index score as a criterion narrows the eligibility to a specific subset of patients.

Recruitment:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Recruited patients (recruitment visit, −1) attended an initial 8-week outpatient-based PR programme conducted in each hospital rehabilitation department.&quot;</span> <span style='background-color: #ffe9e2' title='Moved squared brackets during extraction'>Score: [4]</span> The recruitment process involved patients attending an outpatient-based PR program, which is similar to usual care. However, the specific details of the recruitment process are not provided in the full text, making it difficult to assess the level of extra effort made to recruit participants.
2. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;All patients gave written informed consent.&quot;</span> <span style='background-color: #ffe9e2' title='Moved squared brackets during extraction'>Score: [5]</span> The use of written informed consent suggests that the recruitment process followed standard ethical guidelines and was likely pragmatic in nature.

Setting:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;A multicentre open-label pragmatic parallel-group randomized clinical trial involving 13 hospitals.&quot;</span> <span style='background-color: #ffe9e2' title='Moved squared brackets during extraction'>Score: [3]</span> The trial was conducted in multiple hospitals, which suggests a more pragmatic approach. However, the specific types of hospitals or settings are not described, making it difficult to fully assess the level of difference from usual care.

Organization:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Patients in the IG were asked to continue at home with a similar training schedule to that completed in the hospital.&quot;</span> <span style='background-color: #ffe9e2' title='Moved squared brackets during extraction'>Score: [4]</span> The organization of care delivery in the intervention arm was similar to usual care, with patients continuing their training at home. However, the specific resources and provider expertise available in the intervention arm are not described, making it difficult to fully assess the level of difference from usual care.

Flexibility (delivery):
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Patients in the IG were asked to continue at home with a similar training schedule to that completed in the hospital.&quot;</span> <span style='background-color: #ffe9e2' title='Moved squared brackets during extraction'>Score: [4]</span> The intervention arm allowed for flexibility in how the training was delivered, with patients continuing their training at home. However, the specific details of the training protocol and any restrictions or guidelines are not provided, making it difficult to fully assess the level of flexibility.

Flexibility (adherence):
Score: [NA] This domain is not applicable to this trial as there is no mention of adherence issues or measures to improve adherence.

Follow-up:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;After the randomization visit, follow-up appointments were arranged for both groups at 3, 9 and 12 months.&quot;</span> <span style='background-color: #ffe9e2' title='Moved squared brackets during extraction'>Score: [4]</span> The follow-up schedule in this trial is similar to usual care, with appointments at regular intervals. However, the specific intensity of measurement and follow-up is not described, making it difficult to fully assess the level of difference from usual care.

Primary outcome:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Exercise tolerance (the ability to sustain exercise) was assessed using distance covered in the 6MWT.&quot;</span> <span style='background-color: #ffe9e2' title='Moved squared brackets during extraction'>Score: [5]</span> The primary outcome of exercise tolerance is relevant to participants and is a commonly used measure in usual care for COPD patients.

Primary analysis:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;All available data from the randomized patients were used in the mixed models.&quot;</span> <span style='background-color: #ffe9e2' title='Moved squared brackets during extraction'>Score: [5]</span> The use of all available data in the analysis suggests a pragmatic approach, using an intention-to-treat analysis with all randomized participants.

Overall, this trial appears to have a pragmatic design, with some domains scoring higher than others. The eligibility criteria, recruitment process, and primary outcome are aligned with usual care, while the setting, organization, and flexibility of delivery show some differences. The flexibility of adherence domain is not applicable, and the level of flexibility in adherence is not described. The follow-up and primary analysis domains align with a pragmatic approach.</pre>

<pre>
Eligibility:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants were included from September 2016 to October 2018, after being invited via seven MS clinics (specified in “Acknowledgements” section) and targeted advertisements sent out via the Danish MS Society. The inclusion criteria were as follows: age > 18, confirmed diagnosis of MS, Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS): 2.0–6.5, Six Spot Step Test (SSST) score > 8 seconds or Timed 25-Foot Walk (T25FW) > 5 seconds, relapse-free within the past 8 weeks, and no adjustment of disease-modifying medication or medication that affects gait performance and spasticity within the past 8 weeks. Exclusion criteria were as follows: co-morbidity in terms of cognitive disorders or alcohol abuse (based on clinical judgment), pathologies that did not allow systematic PRT >1 session/week within the last 3 months.&quot;</span> <span style='background-color: #ffe9e2' title='Moved squared brackets during extraction'>Score: [3]</span> The inclusion criteria are relatively broad, allowing for a range of participants with MS to be included. However, the exclusion criteria are not clearly defined and may introduce some selection bias.
Recruitment:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants were included from September 2016 to October 2018, after being invited via seven MS clinics (specified in “Acknowledgements” section) and targeted advertisements sent out via the Danish MS Society.&quot;</span> <span style='background-color: #ffe9e2' title='Moved squared brackets during extraction'>Score: [4]</span> The recruitment methods used in this trial, including invitations through MS clinics and targeted advertisements, are likely to be similar to those used in usual care settings. However, the specific details of the recruitment process are not provided, so a score of 4 is given.
Setting:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;This study was designed as a multi-centered, randomized control trial with two intervention groups and a control group (CON).&quot;</span> <span style='background-color: #ffe9e2' title='Moved squared brackets during extraction'>Score: [3]</span> The trial was conducted at multiple centers, which may introduce some variation in the setting compared to usual care. However, the specific details of the trial settings are not provided, so a score of 3 is given.
Organisation:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;All training sessions were supervised by physiotherapists who were trained to deliver the intervention.&quot;</span> <span style='background-color: #ffe9e2' title='Moved squared brackets during extraction'>Score: [4]</span> The intervention was delivered by trained physiotherapists, which is likely similar to the organization of care in usual care settings. However, the specific details of the organization of care in the intervention arm compared to usual care are not provided, so a score of 4 is given.
Flexibility (delivery):
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The BMCT intervention consisted of 20 1-hour training sessions over 10 weeks (two sessions/week). All sessions started with a 10-minute warm-up on a stationary bicycle or treadmill.&quot;</span> <span style='background-color: #ffe9e2' title='Moved squared brackets during extraction'>Score: [4]</span> The intervention protocol allows for some flexibility in the delivery, such as the use of stationary bicycle or treadmill for warm-up. However, the specific details of the flexibility in how the intervention is delivered compared to usual care are not provided, so a score of 4 is given.
Flexibility (adherence):
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Both BMCT and PRT significantly reduced fatigue impact.&quot;</span> <span style='background-color: #ffe9e2' title='Moved squared brackets during extraction'>Score: [NA]</span> This domain is not applicable to this trial as there is no compliance issue after consent has been given.
Follow-up:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The follow-up test was performed within 7 days of the last intervention session or after the last day of being on the waitlist.&quot;</span> <span style='background-color: #ffe9e2' title='Moved squared brackets during extraction'>Score: [5]</span> The follow-up procedures are similar to usual care, with follow-up assessments conducted shortly after the intervention period or waitlist period. A score of 5 is given.
Primary outcome:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The primary comparisons showed that BMCT, but not PRT, improved T25FW, SSST, and self-perceived gait function when compared to CON.&quot;</span> <span style='background-color: #ffe9e2' title='Moved squared brackets during extraction'>Score: [5]</span> The primary outcome measures used in this trial are relevant to participants with MS and are likely to be important outcomes in usual care. The results show that BMCT had a significant effect on these outcomes compared to the control group, while PRT did not. A score of 5 is given.
Primary analysis:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Analyses were carried out as intention-to-treat, where all participants who completed the baseline assessment were included regardless of their adherence to the allocated intervention.&quot;</span> <span style='background-color: #ffe9e2' title='Moved squared brackets during extraction'>Score: [5]</span> The primary analysis was conducted on an intention-to-treat basis, which is a pragmatic approach that includes all participants regardless of their adherence to the intervention. A score of 5 is given.</pre>

<pre>
Eligibility:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The inclusion criteria for the trial were clinical diagnosis of MS, as defined by the modified McDonald criteria, with an Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score of 1.0–6.5, and able to walk a 10-metre distance; aged 18–65 years; clinically stable for at least four weeks prior to entering the study; physically able to participate in exercise three times per week; able to provide written informed consent.&quot;</span> <span style='background-color: #ffe9e2' title='Moved squared brackets during extraction'>Score: [4]</span> The eligibility criteria for this trial are relatively broad, including a range of disability levels and age groups. However, there are still some exclusions, such as those who are unable to walk a 10-meter distance or participate in exercise three times per week.

Recruitment:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;A total of 120 PwMS were recruited via the Sheffield MS Clinic and flyers/community adverts displayed at the local South Yorkshire MS Society branches.&quot;</span> <span style='background-color: #ffe9e2' title='Moved squared brackets during extraction'>Score: [4]</span> The recruitment methods used in this trial include both clinic-based recruitment and community-based advertising. This suggests that some extra effort was made to recruit participants beyond what would be used in usual care, but it is not clear if additional incentives or targeted invitation letters were used.
2. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Of 349 potential participants who were assessed for eligibility, 120 (34%) were randomised.&quot;</span> <span style='background-color: #ffe9e2' title='Moved squared brackets during extraction'>Score: [3]</span> The recruitment rate of 34% suggests that there may have been some challenges in recruiting participants for this trial. However, without more information on the total number of eligible participants and the reasons for non-participation, it is difficult to fully assess the recruitment efforts.

Setting:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;An exercise physiologist supervised the delivery of the intervention but with physiotherapist input during the early stages of the programme.&quot;</span> <span style='background-color: #ffe9e2' title='Moved squared brackets during extraction'>Score: [4]</span> The intervention was delivered by an exercise physiologist, which suggests that it was implemented in a specialized setting. However, the involvement of a physiotherapist during the early stages of the program may indicate some flexibility in the setting, potentially allowing for delivery in a more usual care setting.
2. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;During weeks 1–6, participants attended two supervised sessions per week at a university exercise research facility and engaged in one additional self-directed exercise session in their home environment.&quot;</span> <span style='background-color: #ffe9e2' title='Moved squared brackets during extraction'>Score: [3]</span> The intervention involved both supervised sessions at a university exercise research facility and self-directed exercise sessions at home. While the university exercise research facility may not be a usual care setting, the inclusion of self-directed exercise at home suggests some flexibility in the setting.

Organisation:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The supervised exercise sessions incorporated cognitive-behavioural techniques to promote long-term participation in physical activity.&quot;</span> <span style='background-color: #ffe9e2' title='Moved squared brackets during extraction'>Score: [4]</span> The intervention included cognitive-behavioural techniques, which suggests that some additional resources and training were provided to support participants in their exercise behavior change. However, without more information on the specific resources and training provided, it is difficult to fully assess the level of difference in organization compared to usual care.

Flexibility (delivery):
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The prescribed strength training was based on individual functional needs, as assessed by the trial physiotherapist.&quot;</span> <span style='background-color: #ffe9e2' title='Moved squared brackets during extraction'>Score: [4]</span> The intervention included individualized strength training based on participants' functional needs, which suggests some flexibility in how the intervention was delivered. However, without more information on the specific protocols and guidelines used, it is difficult to fully assess the level of flexibility in delivery.

Flexibility (adherence):
Score: [NA] This domain is not applicable to this trial as there is no mention of adherence issues or measures to improve adherence.

Follow-up:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Outcomes were assessed at baseline, and at three months (post-intervention) and nine months after randomisation.&quot;</span> <span style='background-color: #ffe9e2' title='Moved squared brackets during extraction'>Score: [4]</span> The follow-up period of three and nine months is longer than what would typically be done in usual care. However, without more information on the intensity and frequency of measurement and follow-up, it is difficult to fully assess the level of difference in follow-up compared to usual care.

Primary outcome:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The primary outcome was self-reported exercise behaviour at three months using the Godin Leisure Time Exercise Questionnaire (GLTEQ).&quot;</span> <span style='background-color: #ffe9e2' title='Moved squared brackets during extraction'>Score: [4]</span> The primary outcome of self-reported exercise behavior is relevant to participants and is measured using a validated questionnaire. However, without more information on the specific outcomes and their relevance to usual care, it is difficult to fully assess the level of difference in the primary outcome compared to usual care.

Primary analysis:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;All analyses were by intention to treat, whereby participants were analysed in the arm to which they were randomised irrespective of whether they complied with the intervention.&quot;</span> <span style='background-color: #ffe9e2' title='Moved squared brackets during extraction'>Score: [5]</span> The primary analysis was conducted on an intention-to-treat basis, which includes all participants regardless of their compliance with the intervention. This approach is consistent with a pragmatic trial design and ensures that the analysis reflects the real-world effectiveness of the intervention.</pre>

<pre>
1. Eligibility:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Key inclusion criteria permitted the participation of men or women ≥18 years of age with confirmed and documented RRMS diagnosis (as defined by the Revised McDonald criteria) (Polman et al., 2011), Kurtzke Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score of 0 to 5.5 at the screening visit, and, 30 days prior to randomization, a stable neurological condition, relapse-free status, and no use of any corticosteroid or adrenocorticotropic hormone treatment.&quot;</span>
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Key exclusion criteria were previous exposure to GA40, a progressive form of MS or neuromyelitis optica, the use of experimental or investigational drugs, participation in clinical drug studies within the 6 months before screening, recent use of immunosuppressive medications or immunoglobulins/monoclonal antibodies, or previous use of alemtuzumab, cladribine, cyclophosphamide, or mitoxantrone.&quot;</span>

The full text provides clear information on the eligibility criteria for the trial, including the specific inclusion and exclusion criteria. The criteria are well-defined and specific to the target population of patients with RRMS. Based on this information, the trial appears to have a relatively explanatory approach with some exclusions, but overall it seems to be pragmatic. 

Score: [4]

2. Recruitment:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The CONFIDENCE study was a multinational, multicenter, randomized, parallel-group, phase 4, open-label study conducted at 88 study centers in 14 countries (Russia, Poland, Italy, France, Croatia, US [including Puerto Rico], Mexico, Spain, Austria, Turkey, Belgium, Argentina, Germany, and Finland) across different geographic regions.&quot;</span>
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Eligible patients were randomly assigned 1:1 to receive subcutaneous injections of GA40 (n = 431) or GA20 (n = 430). Five scheduled visits at study sites occurred at screening (within 2 weeks prior to baseline), baseline (Month 0), and Months 1, 3, and 6 (end of the core phase). Patients also participated in self-reported, daily at-home MSQ assessments on Days 1 through 7 after the baseline visit.&quot;</span>

The full text provides information on the recruitment process, including the number of study centers and countries involved in the trial. It also mentions the random assignment of eligible patients to the two treatment groups. However, there is no specific information on the recruitment efforts made to engage with patients beyond the standard study visits and assessments.

Score: [3]

3. Setting:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The CONFIDENCE study was a multinational, multicenter, randomized, parallel-group, phase 4, open-label study conducted at 88 study centers in 14 countries (Russia, Poland, Italy, France, Croatia, US [including Puerto Rico], Mexico, Spain, Austria, Turkey, Belgium, Argentina, Germany, and Finland) across different geographic regions.&quot;</span>

The full text provides information on the setting of the trial, which involved multiple study centers in 14 different countries. This suggests that the trial was conducted in a variety of settings, including different healthcare systems and regions. However, there is no specific information on how different the trial setting was from the usual care setting.

Score: [3]

4. Organisation:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The overall treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) profile in both treatment groups was consistent with previous findings (Wolinsky et al., 2015) (Table 2). A significantly lower percentage of patients in the GA40 cohort (8.6%) reported injection-site pruritus than those in the GA20 cohort (13.6%, p = 0.023).&quot;</span>

The full text provides information on the adverse event profile of the two treatment groups, indicating that the overall organization of care delivery in terms of safety monitoring and management was similar between the groups. However, there is no specific information on any additional resources, provider expertise, or changes in care delivery organization in the intervention arm compared to usual care.

Score: [4]

5. Flexibility (delivery):
- No relevant quotes or information provided.

The full text does not provide any information on the flexibility in how the intervention is delivered or how it compares to usual care. Therefore, it is not possible to assess this domain.

Score: [NA]

6. Flexibility (adherence):
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Patients’ adherence to treatment measured at Months 1, 3, and 6 using the MS-TAQ questionnaire showed consistently greater adherence to treatment in patients receiving GA40 compared with those receiving GA20 (Fig. 5).&quot;</span>

The full text provides information on the adherence to treatment measured using the MS-TAQ questionnaire. It indicates that patients receiving GA40 had greater adherence compared to those receiving GA20. This suggests that the trial had a pragmatic approach with no additional measures to improve adherence or exclusion based on adherence.

Score: [5]

7. Follow-up:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Patients (N = 861) were randomly assigned 1:1 to receive GA20 (n = 430) or GA40 (n = 431) during the core phase. The primary endpoint was patient-reported medication satisfaction using the Medication Satisfaction Questionnaire (MSQ). Secondary endpoints included self-reported convenience perception using the Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire for Medication-9 convenience component, symptomatic changes (Modified Fatigue Impact Scale, MFIS), and Mental Health Inventory (MHI). Treatment adherence was measured by Multiple Sclerosis Treatment Adherence Questionnaire. Results from the core phase were included.&quot;</span>

The full text provides information on the follow-up period, which lasted for 6 months. It mentions the scheduled visits at study sites at baseline and Months 1, 3, and 6, indicating the intensity of measurement and follow-up during the trial. However, there is no specific information on the likely follow-up in usual care.

Score: [4]

8. Primary outcome:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The primary endpoint was patient-reported medication satisfaction using the Medication Satisfaction Questionnaire (MSQ).&quot;</span>

The full text clearly states the primary outcome of the trial, which is patient-reported medication satisfaction using the MSQ. This indicates that the primary outcome is relevant to participants and focuses on their satisfaction with the intervention.

Score: [5]

9. Primary analysis:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis set included all randomly assigned participants and were analyzed according to the treatment group to which they were randomly assigned, regardless of which treatment they actually received.&quot;</span>

The full text provides information on the primary analysis, which was based on the intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis set. This indicates that all randomly assigned participants were included in the analysis, regardless of the treatment they actually received. This approach ensures that all data are included in the analysis of the primary outcome.

Eligibility:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants were recruited through a statewide organization providing education and support to people with MS, and a large specialist MS outpatient clinic. To be included, people had to be aged 18 years or more, have a confirmed diagnosis of relapsing–remitting MS, have an Ambulation Index score19 of 2, 3 or 4 (mild to moderate walking disabilities), and have received medical clearance to participate.&quot;</span> <span style='background-color: #ffe9e2' title='Moved squared brackets during extraction'>Score: [4]</span> The eligibility criteria for this trial are relatively pragmatic, as they include a broad range of participants with relapsing-remitting MS and mild to moderate walking disabilities. However, the inclusion of participants from specific organizations and the requirement for medical clearance may limit the generalizability of the trial to the broader population of people with MS.

Recruitment:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants were recruited through a statewide organization providing education and support to people with MS, and a large specialist MS outpatient clinic. Recruitment information flyers were sent by mail to all potential participants registered on the mailing lists of both organizations.&quot;</span> <span style='background-color: #ffe9e2' title='Moved squared brackets during extraction'>Score: [3]</span> The recruitment methods used in this trial involve targeted approaches through specific organizations and mailing lists. While this may increase the likelihood of recruiting eligible participants, it may also introduce selection bias and limit the generalizability of the trial to the broader population of people with MS.
2. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;There was good adherence with the training program (92%), compared with the control group’s adherence with the increased attention and social activities program (62%).&quot;</span> <span style='background-color: #ffe9e2' title='Moved squared brackets during extraction'>Score: [4]</span> The high adherence rate suggests that the recruitment strategies used in this trial were effective in engaging participants and encouraging their participation in the intervention.

Setting:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The experimental group completed a 10-week (two times per week), PRT program in one of four community gymnasiums in metropolitan and regional areas.&quot;</span> <span style='background-color: #ffe9e2' title='Moved squared brackets during extraction'>Score: [4]</span> The use of community gymnasiums for the intervention suggests that the setting of the trial closely resembles usual care settings where people with MS may engage in exercise programs. However, the specific selection of gymnasiums may limit the generalizability of the trial to settings without access to such facilities.

Organization:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants in the control group received ‘usual care’ plus a social program.&quot;</span> <span style='background-color: #ffe9e2' title='Moved squared brackets during extraction'>Score: [4]</span> The control group received usual care, which suggests that the organization of care delivery in the intervention arm of the trial closely resembles usual care settings for people with MS. However, the addition of a social program may introduce additional resources and expertise that may not be available in usual care settings.

Flexibility (delivery):
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The exercises targeted the key lower limb muscles for supporting body weight and for generating and absorbing power during walking.&quot;</span> <span style='background-color: #ffe9e2' title='Moved squared brackets during extraction'>Score: [4]</span> The intervention in this trial involved targeted exercises for specific muscle groups, which suggests a relatively pragmatic approach to the delivery of the intervention. However, the specific exercises used may limit the flexibility of the intervention compared to usual care settings where a broader range of exercises may be used.

Flexibility (adherence):
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;No between-group differences were detected after 10 weeks or 22 weeks for symptoms of muscle stiffness or muscle spasm.&quot;</span> <span style='background-color: #ffe9e2' title='Moved squared brackets during extraction'>Score: [5]</span> The trial did not include any specific measures or interventions to improve adherence to the intervention, suggesting a pragmatic approach where no additional efforts were made to improve adherence beyond what would be expected in usual care settings.

Follow-up:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants were asked to return to their usual activities and not to continue or commence resistance training until after the follow-up assessment session.&quot;</span> <span style='background-color: #ffe9e2' title='Moved squared brackets during extraction'>Score: [4]</span> The follow-up period in this trial involved participants returning to their usual activities, which closely resembles the likely follow-up in usual care settings. However, the specific instructions given to participants may limit the generalizability of the trial to settings where participants may continue or commence resistance training during the follow-up period.

Primary outcome:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;At the end of the 10-week program, participants in the PRT group did not significantly increase the distance they walked over 2 min or increase their maximal walking speed compared with the control group.&quot;</span> <span style='background-color: #ffe9e2' title='Moved squared brackets during extraction'>Score: [2]</span> The primary outcome measure in this trial, walking performance, was not found to be significantly different between the intervention and control groups. This suggests that the trial may have used outcome measures that are not directly relevant to participants and may not be of obvious importance to them.

<pre>
Eligibility:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Adults diagnosed with MS were included based on the ability to walk 5 km without rest or use of assistive device.&quot;</span> [1]
2. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Exclusion criteria were reports to have run 5 km in the preceding 6 months or a relapse occurring in the preceding 3 months.&quot;</span> [1]
3. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Recruited participants showed only mild walking impairment and likely had high exercise self-efficacy levels as they were willing to engage in an individual community-located running training.&quot;</span> [1]

The eligibility criteria for this trial were relatively strict, as participants had to be able to walk 5 km without rest or use of an assistive device. Additionally, individuals who had run 5 km in the preceding 6 months or experienced a relapse in the preceding 3 months were excluded. The recruitment of participants with mild walking impairment and high exercise self-efficacy suggests a more explanatory approach. Score: [2]

Recruitment:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;pwMS were assigned to the experimental (EXP) or the “waiting list control” (WLC) group prior to baseline testing.&quot;</span> [1]
2. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants had a specific common goal which was to run together on a public event.&quot;</span> [1]
3. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The addition of two group training sessions with direct supervision by the researchers allowed for expert advice and social interaction and peer support.&quot;</span> [1]

The recruitment process involved assigning participants to either the experimental or control group prior to baseline testing. The common goal of running together on a public event and the inclusion of group training sessions with direct supervision suggest a more pragmatic approach to recruitment. Score: [4]

Setting:
1. <span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 99.4%):

While this suggests some level of diversity in the settings, it is limited to only two regions and may not fully represent the usual care settings for all participants.

Organization:
4. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;All participants received their usual health and social service input throughout the study period.&quot;</span> <span style='background-color: #ffe9e2' title='Moved squared brackets during extraction'>Score: [5]</span> The trial allowed participants to continue receiving their usual health and social services, indicating that the organization of care delivery in the intervention arm was similar to usual care.

Flexibility (delivery):
5. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The intervention consisted of two home-based physiotherapy sessions (60 min each) to set up the standing frame programme, supported by six follow-up telephone calls (15 min per call).&quot;</span> <span style='background-color: #ffe9e2' title='Moved squared brackets during extraction'>Score: [4]</span> The intervention was delivered in a home-based setting, which is likely more flexible than a clinic or hospital-based setting. However, the intervention did involve a specific number of physiotherapy sessions and follow-up calls, suggesting some level of protocol and structure.

Flexibility (adherence):
6. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants were asked to stand for 30 min, three times per week over 20 weeks, and encouraged to continue in the longer term, although no further physiotherapy support was provided.&quot;</span> <span style='background-color: #ffe9e2' title='Moved squared brackets during extraction'>Score: [4]</span> Participants were given a specific recommendation for standing frequency and duration, but they were also encouraged to continue standing in the longer term without further support.

7. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The study had assessor-blinded outcome assessments with use of clinician-rated and patient-rated measures at baseline, 20 weeks, and 36 weeks.&quot;</span> <span style='background-color: #ffe9e2' title='Moved squared brackets during extraction'>Score: [5]</span> The trial had regular follow-up assessments at specific time points, which is consistent with usual care practices for monitoring and measuring outcomes in clinical trials.

Primary outcome:
8. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The primary clinical outcome was motor function measured by the Amended Motor Club Assessment (AMCA) score at week 36.&quot;</span> <span style='background-color: #ffe9e2' title='Moved squared brackets during extraction'>Score: [5]</span> The primary outcome measure, the AMCA score, is directly relevant to the participants and is a measure of motor function, which is important for individuals with progressive multiple sclerosis.

Primary analysis:
9. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The primary analysis of the primary outcome, AMCA score at 36 weeks, followed a modified intention-to-treat approach, regardless of compliance to the intervention.&quot;</span> <span style='background-color: #ffe9e2' title='Moved squared brackets during extraction'>Score: [5]</span> The primary analysis included all participants in the assigned groups, regardless of their compliance with the intervention, which is consistent with a pragmatic approach to analysis.

Overall, the trial appears to have a pragmatic design, with a focus on real-world applicability and relevance to participants. The scores for each domain are as follows:

- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Excluded were patients with reported or medically recorded diagnoses of current serious psychological disorders other than depression and anxiety syndromes, evidence of dementia as indicated by testing below the fifth percentile in at least 3 of 6 dimensions of neuropsychological functioning (i.e., attention and concentration, processing speed, executive function, verbal memory, and verbal processing), other currently life-threatening or severely disabling physical disorders, current MS exacerbation, symptomatic MS medication altered in the last 3 months, other disorders of the CNS, pregnancy, or inability to speak or read German.&quot;</span> [1]

The eligibility criteria for this trial appear to be relatively pragmatic. Patients were recruited from multiple sources, including outpatient clinics, physicians, and advertisements, which suggests that the trial aimed to include a diverse population of individuals with MS. The inclusion criteria were focused on the type and severity of MS, as well as the absence of certain comorbidities or recent changes in medication. While there were some exclusions based on psychological disorders and cognitive impairment, these were limited to serious conditions that could potentially interfere with participation in the intervention. Overall, the eligibility criteria seem to strike a balance between being inclusive and ensuring that participants are representative of the target population. Score: [4]

Recruitment:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;A total of 164 patients with MS referred themselves after having received information via the outpatient neurology clinic of the University Hospital Basel, other physicians, or advertisements posted in the Swiss Multiple Sclerosis Society Bulletin.&quot;</span> [1]

The recruitment methods used in this trial appear to be relatively pragmatic. Patients were recruited through multiple channels, including outpatient clinics, physicians, and advertisements in a MS society bulletin. This suggests that efforts were made to engage with a diverse population of individuals with MS and that the recruitment methods were similar to those used in usual care settings. However, the full text does not provide detailed information about the specific strategies used to recruit participants, such as targeted invitation letters or advertising in newspapers or radio. Therefore, it is difficult to fully assess the extent of extra effort made to recruit participants. Score: [3]

Setting:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;A total of 164 patients with MS referred themselves after having received information via the outpatient neurology clinic of the University Hospital Basel, other physicians, or advertisements posted in the Swiss Multiple Sclerosis Society Bulletin.&quot;</span> [1]

The setting of this trial appears to be relatively pragmatic. Patients were recruited from multiple sources, including outpatient clinics and physicians, which suggests that the trial was conducted in settings that are similar to usual care. However, the full text does not provide information about the specific locations where the intervention and usual care were delivered. Therefore, it is difficult to fully assess the extent to which the trial setting differed from usual care settings. Score: [3]

Organisation:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;All patients in the usual care (UC) group (and in the MBI group) received regular, currently optimal medical care during the duration of the study, as provided by the neurology department of the hospital. This included one medical examination at preintervention and another at 6 months postintervention, with additional measures as individually required.&quot;</span> [1]

The organization of care delivery in this trial appears to be relatively pragmatic. The usual care group received regular medical care provided by the neurology department of the hospital, which suggests that the trial used existing resources and infrastructure for delivering care. The additional measures provided as individually required also indicate a flexible approach to care delivery. However, the full text does not provide detailed information about any additional resources, staff levels, or training provided specifically for the intervention arm of the trial. Therefore, it is difficult to fully assess the extent to which the organization of care delivery differed between the intervention and usual care groups. Score: [4]

Flexibility (delivery):
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;MBI closely followed the program of mindfulness-based stress reduction23 and included 1) a personal intake interview to define realistic goals of participants and establish personal rapport; 2) 8 weekly 2.5-hour classes in mindfulness practices (10–15 participants/group; exercises did not exceed patients' level of functioning); 3) one Saturday, 7-hour session at week 6; 4) homework assignments (approximately 40 minutes/day), emphasized as essential to success of the program; 5) a postintervention interview to evaluate personal experiences, goal attainment, and future maintenance of acquired skills.&quot;</span> [1]

The flexibility in how the intervention was delivered appears to be relatively pragmatic. The intervention consisted of a structured 8-week program with a combination of group sessions, individual interviews, and homework assignments. The program was tailored to the participants' goals and abilities, and the exercises did not exceed their level of functioning. The inclusion of a postintervention interview to evaluate personal experiences and goal attainment suggests a focus on individualized care. However, the full text does not provide information about the extent to which participants were allowed to deviate from the program or make adjustments based on their individual needs. Therefore, it is difficult to fully assess the flexibility in how the intervention was delivered. Score: [4]

Flexibility (adherence):
- This domain is not applicable to this trial as there is no compliance issue after consent has been given. Score: [NA]

Follow-up:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Assessments were made at baseline, postintervention, and 6 months follow-up.&quot;</span> [1]

The intensity of measurement and follow-up in this trial appears to be relatively pragmatic. Assessments were conducted at baseline, postintervention, and 6 months follow-up, which is a reasonable follow-up period for evaluating the effects of the intervention. However, the full text does not provide detailed information about the specific measurements and follow-up procedures used in the trial, such as the frequency and duration of the assessments. Therefore, it is difficult to fully assess the extent to which the intensity of measurement and follow-up differed from usual care. Score: [3]

Primary outcome:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Primary outcomes included disease-specific and disease-aspecific HRQOL, depression, and fatigue.&quot;</span> [1]

The relevance of the trial's primary outcome to participants appears to be relatively pragmatic. The primary outcomes included measures of health-related quality of life (HRQOL), depression, and fatigue, which are all outcomes that are likely to be important to individuals with multiple sclerosis (MS). The full text does not provide information about the specific measures used to assess these outcomes, but the inclusion of disease-specific and disease-aspecific HRQOL measures suggests a focus on outcomes that are directly relevant to the participants' experience of living with MS. Score: [5]

Primary analysis:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Employing intention-to-treat analysis, MBI, compared with UC, improved nonphysical dimensions of primary outcomes at postintervention and follow-up (p < 0.002); effect sizes, 0.4–0.9 posttreatment and 0.3–0.5 at follow-up.&quot;</span> [1]

The extent to which all data were included in the analysis of the primary outcome is not explicitly stated in the full text. However, the use of intention-to-treat analysis suggests that all randomized participants were included in the analysis, regardless of their adherence to the intervention or completion of follow-up assessments. Therefore, it can be inferred that all available data were included in the analysis of the primary outcome. Score: [4]</pre>

The full text provides information on the eligibility criteria for the trial. Patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) who were severely affected and had unresolved symptoms, psychosocial concerns, end-of-life issues, progressive illness, or complex needs were included. The trial was conducted in South East London and patients were referred by clinicians. Based on this information, the trial appears to have a pragmatic approach to eligibility criteria, as it includes patients who would typically receive palliative care in usual care settings. Score: [4]

Recruitment:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Patients in South East London who were severely affected by MS were referred by clinicians to the trial.&quot;</span> [Quote 1]

The full text mentions that patients were referred to the trial by clinicians and that educational seminars were conducted to inform healthcare professionals about the palliative care team (PCT). However, there is no information provided on any additional recruitment efforts or strategies used to engage with patients beyond the referral process. Without further details, it is difficult to assess the level of effort made to recruit participants. Score: [NA]

Setting:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Patients in South East London who were severely affected by MS were referred by clinicians to the trial.&quot;</span> [Quote 1]

The trial was conducted in South East London, which suggests that the setting of the trial was similar to the usual care setting for patients in that region. Score: [4]

Organisation:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;This comprised one part-time consultant in palliative medicine, one part-time clinical nurse specialist, one administrator, and one psychosocial worker, and was based in a large teaching hospital.&quot;</span> [Quote 2]

The full text provides information on the resources and provider expertise available in the intervention arm of the trial. The palliative care team (PCT) consisted of healthcare professionals with expertise in palliative care and the trial was based in a large teaching hospital. This suggests that the trial may have required additional resources and provider expertise compared to usual care. Score: [3]

Flexibility (delivery):
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The PCT undertook assessments, suggested ways to improve physical, emotional, social, and other problems, provided specialist welfare benefits advice and bereavement support, and liaised with and acted as a catalyst for local services, both primary and specialist teams.&quot;</span> [Quote 2]

The full text describes the activities of the palliative care team (PCT), which included assessments, providing recommendations for improvement, and offering support and liaison with other services. These activities suggest that there may have been some flexibility in how the intervention was delivered to meet the individual needs of patients. Score: [3]

Flexibility (adherence):
No information is provided in the full text to assess the flexibility in how participants must adhere to the intervention. Score: [NA]

Follow-up:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Data were collected at baseline, 6, 12, 18, and 26 weeks on use of services, patient symptoms, other outcomes, and caregiver burden.&quot;</span> [Quote 1]

The full text mentions the follow-up periods for data collection, which were conducted at multiple time points up to 26 weeks. This suggests that the intensity of measurement and follow-up in the trial may have been more frequent and longer than usual care. Score: [2]

Primary outcome:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;At 12 weeks, caregiver burden was 4.47 points lower (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.05–7.89) in the fast track compared to the control group.&quot;</span> [Quote 2]

The primary outcome of the trial was caregiver burden, which is relevant to the participants and their caregivers. The trial focused on improving the well-being of patients and their caregivers, which suggests a pragmatic approach to the primary outcome. Score: [5]

Primary analysis:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;We planned an intention-to-treat analysis, irrespective of whether patients were assessed as having palliative care needs or the nature of contact with the PCT.&quot;</span> [Quote 2]

The full text mentions that an intention-to-treat analysis was planned, which indicates that all data, including data from ineligible post-randomization participants, were included in the analysis of the primary outcome. This approach aligns with a pragmatic analysis that includes all available data. Score: [5]</pre>

<pre>
Eligibility:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Inclusion criteria were: 1) having a definite diagnosis of MS from a neurologist; 2) being within 5 years of receiving a diagnosis of MS; 3) scoring at least 10 on the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) [26]; 4) not currently undertaking other psychological treatment for depressive or anxiety symptoms for the length of participation in the current trial; 5) speak English fluently; 6) no current or lifetime diagnosis of psychosis; 7) no current substance dependency; 8) no gross cognitive impairment; and 9) no changes to medications prior and during involvement in the trial.&quot;</span> [1]
2. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants were recruited through neurologists working in a large MS outpatient clinic at the hospital, advertisements on MS related websites and local press releases.&quot;</span> [2]
3. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The study took place at a large teaching and research hospital in Melbourne, Australia.&quot;</span> [2]

The eligibility criteria for this trial appear to be relatively pragmatic. The inclusion criteria are specific to individuals with a definite diagnosis of MS within 5 years, and the exclusion criteria are reasonable and relevant to the study population. The recruitment methods also seem pragmatic, as participants were recruited through neurologists and advertisements on MS-related websites and local press releases. The setting of the trial, a large teaching and research hospital, is also pragmatic. Score: [4]

Recruitment:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants were recruited through neurologists working in a large MS outpatient clinic at the hospital, advertisements on MS related websites and local press releases.&quot;</span> [2]

The recruitment methods used in this trial appear to be relatively pragmatic. Participants were recruited through neurologists in a large MS outpatient clinic, which is a common and practical approach. Additionally, advertisements on MS-related websites and local press releases were used, which can help reach a wider population. Score: [4]

Setting:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The study took place at a large teaching and research hospital in Melbourne, Australia.&quot;</span> [2]

The setting of this trial, a large teaching and research hospital, is relatively explanatory. While it may provide access to specialized resources and expertise, it may not reflect the usual care setting for individuals with MS. Score: [2]

Organization:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The tailored CBT intervention lends from Beck’s cognitive theoretical model for the treatment of depression in adults. Participants were given homework to complete for each of the 8 sessions. All sessions (apart from the first session which was 1.5 h) were 1 h in duration and took place in a clinic room at the hospital. A senior clinical psychologist and a provisional clinical psychologist (supervised by the clinical psychologist) provided the intervention.&quot;</span> [2]

The organization of care delivery in the intervention arm of this trial appears to be relatively pragmatic. The intervention is based on a well-established theoretical model and is delivered by trained clinical psychologists. The sessions take place in a clinic room at the hospital, which is a practical and accessible setting. Score: [4]

Flexibility (delivery):
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The CBT intervention consisted of 8 individual modules which focused on CBT based principles and strategies. These strategies included progressive muscle relaxation, controlled breathing exercises, pleasant activity scheduling, problem solving skills, cognitive exercises which helped individuals identify, challenge and manage unhelpful thoughts and beliefs.&quot;</span> [2]

The flexibility in how the intervention is delivered in this trial appears to be relatively pragmatic. The intervention consists of 8 individual modules that focus on CBT-based principles and strategies. The specific strategies used, such as progressive muscle relaxation and problem-solving skills, are practical and applicable to usual care. Score: [4]

Flexibility (adherence):
This domain is not applicable to this trial as there is no compliance issue after consent has been given. Score: [NA]

Follow-up:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;All participants completed the pre, post and 20 week follow up questionnaires.&quot;</span> [2]

The intensity of measurement and follow-up in this trial appears to be relatively pragmatic. Participants completed pre, post, and 20-week follow-up questionnaires, which is a reasonable and practical approach. Score: [4]

Primary outcome:
1. <span title='Moderate quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 93.5%):

The primary outcome was level of depressive symptoms at post and 3 month follow up which was measured with the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II)' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ff9e81'>&quot;The primary outcome was level of depressive symptoms at post and at 20 weeks follow up which was measured with the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II).&quot;</span> [2]

The primary outcome of this trial, level of depressive symptoms measured with the BDI-II, appears to be relevant to participants. Depression is a common and important outcome to assess in individuals with MS. Score: [5]

Primary analysis:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Results of ANCOVAs examining group differences on primary and secondary variables at pre, post and 20 week follow up are presented in Table 2.&quot;</span> [2]

The primary analysis of this trial appears to be relatively pragmatic. Group differences on primary and secondary variables were analyzed using ANCOVAs, which is a common and appropriate statistical method. Score: [4]</pre>

Eligibility:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants were recruited from this register. Participants had a confirmed diagnosis of multiple sclerosis, an Extended Disability Status Scale33 score of 5 (ambulatory without aid or rest for about 200 m) to 6.5 (constant bilateral assistance required to walk about 20 m without resting), stable rehabilitation and drug therapy for 30 days before entry into the study, cognitive scores of over 24 on the Mini-Mental State Examination34 and access to the intervention sites using their own or public transport.&quot;</span> <span style='background-color: #ffe9e2' title='Moved squared brackets during extraction'>Score: [4]</span> The eligibility criteria for this trial are moderately pragmatic. They include specific inclusion criteria related to the severity of multiple sclerosis and exclude individuals with recent exacerbations or medical conditions that may preclude them from participating. However, the criteria are not overly restrictive and are likely to include a representative sample of individuals with multiple sclerosis.

Recruitment:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Of the 873 patients on the clinical register for multiple sclerosis 159 patients were deemed suitable for the study. These people were sent invitation letters and participant information sheets. Forty-three potential participants expressed an interest in participating.&quot;</span> <span style='background-color: #ffe9e2' title='Moved squared brackets during extraction'>Score: [4]</span> The recruitment methods used in this trial are moderately pragmatic. The study recruited participants from a clinical register and sent invitation letters to eligible individuals. While this approach may have introduced some selection bias, it is likely to be similar to how participants would be recruited in usual care settings.

Setting:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The intervention took place at two different geographical locations (Site A and Site B).&quot;</span> <span style='background-color: #ffe9e2' title='Moved squared brackets during extraction'>Score: [4]</span> The setting of this trial is moderately pragmatic. The intervention was conducted in community leisure centers, which are likely to be similar to the usual care settings where individuals with multiple sclerosis would receive exercise interventions.

Organization:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants assigned to the intervention group attended a leisure centre-based exercise class, twice weekly for 12 weeks. Each group was led by two instructors (one physiotherapist and one fitness instructor).&quot;</span> <span style='background-color: #ffe9e2' title='Moved squared brackets during extraction'>Score: [4]</span> The organization of care delivery in this trial is moderately pragmatic. The intervention was delivered by a team of instructors, including a physiotherapist and a fitness instructor, which is likely to be similar to the usual care setting where individuals with multiple sclerosis would receive exercise interventions.

Flexibility (delivery):
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants completed a circuit of 8–12 different exercises for 1 minute each, having a rest (of a minimum of 1 minute) before moving to the next exercise. Not all exercises were performed at all classes, and in week 9 a fifth level of difficulty was added to some of the exercises to encourage progress.&quot;</span> <span style='background-color: #ffe9e2' title='Moved squared brackets during extraction'>Score: [4]</span> The flexibility in how the intervention is delivered in this trial is moderately pragmatic. The exercise program included a variety of exercises and allowed participants to progress in difficulty over time. This approach is likely to be similar to the flexibility in how exercise interventions are delivered in usual care settings.

Flexibility (adherence):
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants assigned to the control group were advised to continue their usual routine, seeking any healthcare as required. They were asked to avoid beginning any new exercise regime for the 12 weeks of the study.&quot;</span> <span style='background-color: #ffe9e2' title='Moved squared brackets during extraction'>Score: [5]</span> The flexibility in how participants must adhere to the intervention in this trial is very pragmatic. The control group was not required to adhere to any specific exercise regimen and were allowed to continue their usual routine. This approach is similar to usual care where individuals with multiple sclerosis may or may not engage in exercise.

Follow-up:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Outcome measures were carried out within the local hospital’s rehabilitation unit. They were taken at baseline, after 8 and 12 weeks of the intervention period (i.e. either the exercise class or usual care).&quot;</span> <span style='background-color: #ffe9e2' title='Moved squared brackets during extraction'>Score: [4]</span> The intensity of measurement and follow-up in this trial is moderately pragmatic. Outcome measures were collected at baseline, after 8 weeks, and after 12 weeks, which is likely to be similar to the follow-up in usual care settings.

Primary outcome:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;For the primary outcome measure, the Timed 25-Foot Walk Test, the ANOVA results demonstrated no statistically significant difference over time.&quot;</span> <span style='background-color: #ffe9e2' title='Moved squared brackets during extraction'>Score: [2]</span> The primary outcome measure in this trial is more explanatory than pragmatic. The Timed 25-Foot Walk Test is a physiological outcome that may not be directly relevant to participants. Additionally, the lack of statistically significant difference over time suggests that the outcome may not be of obvious importance to participants.

Primary analysis:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Data were analysed using a univariate general linear model analysis of variance (ANOVA) which allowed for missing data, possible differences over time (baseline, week 8 and week 12) and possible differences between groups (intervention and control) to be assessed.&quot;</span> <span style='background-color: #ffe9e2' title='Moved squared brackets during extraction'>Score: [4]</span> The primary analysis in this trial is moderately pragmatic. The analysis included all available data and accounted for possible differences over time and between groups.

<pre>
Eligibility:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Subjects had a deﬁnite diag- nosis of primary or secondary progressive MS, and an EDSS of between 6.5 (constant bilateral assistance required to walk about 20 metres with- out resting) to 8 (essentially restricted to bed or chair or perambulated in wheelchair, but may be out of bed much of the day, retains many self- care functions and generally has eﬀective use of arms).&quot;</span> [Explanatory] The eligibility criteria for this trial are quite restrictive, only including individuals with moderate to severe MS and specific EDSS scores. This excludes individuals with milder forms of MS and those with different levels of disability. Score: [2]

Recruitment:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;A total of 91 people were contacted, 41 agreed to participate and were screened.&quot;</span> [Explanatory] The recruitment process involved contacting individuals and screening them for eligibility. The number of individuals contacted and the number who agreed to participate is not provided, making it difficult to assess the level of effort made to recruit participants. Score: [NA]

Setting:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Community; subjects’ homes.&quot;</span> [Pragmatic] The trial was conducted in the community and in the participants' homes, which is a setting similar to usual care for individuals with MS. Score: [5]

Organization:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Subjects assigned to Group 1 received physio- therapy, twice weekly for eight weeks, by an experienced domiciliary physiotherapist within their home.&quot;</span> [Pragmatic] The organization of care delivery in the intervention arm involved providing physiotherapy in the participants' homes by an experienced physiotherapist. This is similar to usual care for individuals receiving home-based physiotherapy. Score: [5]

Flexibility (delivery):
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Each session lasted up to 60 min- utes, and a task-speciﬁc programme included upper and lower limb strengthening using thera- band, mobile pedals, and weights. Repetition of tasks such as sit to stand, gait, balance (using gym balls and sit ﬁts) and stretching activities were used depending on the subjects previously identiﬁed goals. Each subject therefore received core treatments aimed to maximize strength, ﬂexibility and function.&quot;</span> [Pragmatic] The intervention was delivered in a flexible manner, tailoring the treatment to the individual's goals and needs. This approach is similar to usual care in physiotherapy, where treatments are often individualized. Score: [5]

Flexibility (adherence):
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;None of the control group received physiotherapy treat- ment during the intervention period.&quot;</span> [Pragmatic] There were no specific measures to improve adherence in the intervention arm, and the control group did not receive any physiotherapy treatment. Score: [5]

Follow-up:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Subjects in both groups were assessed at the beginning and at the end of the eight-week inter- vention period (i.e. either physiotherapy or con- trol) and then again eight weeks later.&quot;</span> [Pragmatic] The follow-up assessments were conducted at the end of the intervention period and eight weeks later, which is similar to usual care for individuals with MS. Score: [5]

Primary outcome:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The MS impact scale (MSIS 29), which is a measure of the physical and psychological impact of MS,12 was the primary outcome measure for the study.&quot;</span> [Pragmatic] The primary outcome measure, the MSIS 29, is relevant to participants as it assesses the impact of MS on their physical and psychological well-being. Score: [5]

Primary analysis:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;All outcome variables were summarized and comparisons made between groups and over time.&quot;</span> [Pragmatic] The primary analysis included all outcome variables and compared the groups and changes over time.

publication full text</span> (mean similarity 100%)</i></p>
<pre>
Eligibility:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants: Two hundred and seventy-eight people with MS were invited to take part in the study. One hundred and eighty-nine people consented to take part (68%). Of these 183 began the study and 169 (92.3%) completed it.&quot;</span> [1]
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The only selection criterion was that the diagnosis of MS was confirmed by the general practitioner. There were no exclusion criteria.&quot;</span> [1]

The study had a high rate of participant consent and completion, indicating that the eligibility criteria were not overly restrictive. Additionally, there were no exclusion criteria, suggesting that the participants in the trial were similar to those who would receive the intervention in usual care. 

Score: [4]

Recruitment:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants were volunteers with MS who were recruited through voluntary organizations, were community based and lived in West London and in counties contiguous with Greater London.&quot;</span> [1]

The participants were recruited through voluntary organizations and were community-based, which suggests that the recruitment methods were pragmatic and similar to usual care. However, the study only recruited participants from a specific geographic area, which may limit the generalizability of the findings.

Score: [4]

Setting:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The study was conducted with people with MS living in the community.&quot;</span> [1]

The study was conducted in a community setting, which is similar to usual care. However, the study was limited to a specific geographic area, which may affect the generalizability of the findings.

Score: [4]

Organisation:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The intervention group were less likely to consider help with activities of daily living to be essential, and were more likely to experience better vitality and mental health than the control group at follow-up.&quot;</span> [1]

The intervention did not require additional resources or expertise beyond what is typically available in usual care. The intervention focused on self-care strategies and did not involve any additional staff, training, or resources.

Score: [5]

Flexibility (delivery):
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The self-care programme primarily comprised a discussion of self-care strategies supported by an information booklet developed for the study in line with consumer priorities.&quot;</span> [1]

The intervention involved a discussion of self-care strategies and the use of an information booklet. The description does not indicate any strict protocols or restrictions on how the intervention was delivered, suggesting that it had flexibility similar to usual care.

Score: [5]

Flexibility (adherence):
- Not applicable. The study did not involve any interventions that required adherence or compliance.

Score: [NA]

Follow-up:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Follow-up assessments were conducted six months after baseline.&quot;</span> [1]

The follow-up assessments were conducted at a similar time frame to usual care, with a six-month follow-up period. There is no indication of more frequent or extensive follow-up measures, suggesting that the intensity of measurement and follow-up was similar to usual care.

Score: [4]

Primary outcome:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Main outcome measures: These included the Barthel Index, a measure of mobility, the SF-36, and the Standard Day Dependency Record (SDDR) which measures the need for assistance with daily activities.&quot;</span> [1]

The primary outcome measures used in the study were relevant to the participants and focused on mobility, quality of life, and independence in daily activities. There is no indication that surrogate or physiological outcomes were used, suggesting that the primary outcome was relevant to participants and similar to usual care.

Score: [5]

Primary analysis:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Missing values on scales were replaced with group means for each outcome measure.&quot;</span> [1]

The analysis included all available data and did not exclude any participants based on eligibility or adherence. There is no indication that only completers or those following the treatment protocol were included in the analysis, suggesting that the primary analysis followed an intention-to-treat approach.

Eligibility:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Inclusion criteria were: having MS (MacDonald criteria); being able to complete a questionnaire; and being in need for a multidisciplinary approach, defined by the requirement, in addition to the neurology specialist, of at least two different medical (rehabilitation specialist, neuro-urology specialist, psychiatrist) or allied health professionals (physiotherapist, occupational therapist, social worker, psychologist, and neuropsychologist).&quot;</span> <span style='background-color: #ffe9e2' title='Moved squared brackets during extraction'>Score: [4]</span> The inclusion criteria for this trial are relatively broad and include patients with MS who require a multidisciplinary approach. However, the specific requirements for the multidisciplinary approach are not clearly defined, which may limit the generalizability of the trial to other settings.

Recruitment:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;MS patients from the outpatient clinic of the Neurology Department of Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital were prospectively enrolled in the study between March 2010 and July 2012.&quot;</span> <span style='background-color: #ffe9e2' title='Moved squared brackets during extraction'>Score: [4]</span> The trial recruited patients from a specific outpatient clinic, which may limit the generalizability of the trial to other settings. However, the recruitment process itself does not appear to involve any additional effort beyond usual care.
2. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Signed informed consent was obtained for each patient at inclusion.&quot;</span> <span style='background-color: #ffe9e2' title='Moved squared brackets during extraction'>Score: [5]</span> The trial used standard informed consent procedures, which is consistent with usual care.

Setting:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;This is a prospective, randomized, controlled, monocentric clinical trial in MS patients.&quot;</span> <span style='background-color: #ffe9e2' title='Moved squared brackets during extraction'>Score: [1]</span> The trial was conducted at a single center, which may limit the generalizability of the trial to other settings. It is not clear if this single center is a specialized trial or academic center, which would further limit generalizability.

Organisation:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;For patients in the IMD group, the multidisciplinary integrated outpatient clinic was planned at our MS clinic within a maximum three-month period after inclusion.&quot;</span> <span style='background-color: #ffe9e2' title='Moved squared brackets during extraction'>Score: [4]</span> The trial used a multidisciplinary integrated outpatient clinic, which suggests that there may be some differences in the organization of care delivery compared to usual care. However, the specific differences in resources, provider expertise, and organization of care delivery are not clearly described.
2. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The study protocol was approved by the coordinator of our local (Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital) ethics committee, and formal review by the committee was judged unnecessary.&quot;</span> <span style='background-color: #ffe9e2' title='Moved squared brackets during extraction'>Score: [5]</span> The trial followed standard ethical approval procedures, which is consistent with usual care.

Flexibility (delivery):
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Depending on their needs, evaluated during the inclusion visit and re-evaluated during the multidisciplinary visit, patients were seen by different MS specialists and allied health professionals.&quot;</span> <span style='background-color: #ffe9e2' title='Moved squared brackets during extraction'>Score: [4]</span> The trial allowed for flexibility in how the intervention was delivered, with patients being seen by different specialists and allied health professionals based on their individual needs. However, the specific details of the flexibility in the intervention delivery are not clearly described.

Flexibility (adherence):
Score: [NA] This domain is not applicable to this trial as there is no mention of adherence issues or measures to improve adherence.

Follow-up:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Primary and secondary outcomes were assessed at inclusion, and after six (M6) and 12 (M12) months.&quot;</span> <span style='background-color: #ffe9e2' title='Moved squared brackets during extraction'>Score: [5]</span> The trial followed a standard follow-up schedule, with assessments at baseline, 6 months, and 12 months, which is consistent with usual care. There is no indication of more frequent or extensive follow-up compared to usual care.

Primary outcome:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The primary outcome was the change in QoL from inclusion to M6, assessed by the Multiple Sclerosis Impact Scale (MSIS-29) self-questionnaire.&quot;</span> <span style='background-color: #ffe9e2' title='Moved squared brackets during extraction'>Score: [5]</span> The primary outcome of the trial is directly relevant to the participants, as it measures the impact of the intervention on their quality of life.

Primary analysis:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;All analyses were performed with the SAS software version 9.2 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA).&quot;</span> <span style='background-color: #ffe9e2' title='Moved squared brackets during extraction'>Score: [5]</span> The trial used intention-to-treat analysis with all available data, which is consistent with a pragmatic approach to the primary analysis.</pre>

The full text indicates that baseline data were collected after randomization and that all patients underwent a comprehensive interview at the end of the one-year follow-up period. This suggests that the intensity of measurement and follow-up in the trial was similar to what would be expected in usual care.

Score: [4]

Primary outcome:
1. <span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 99.3%):

They were assessed at baseline and one year after randomisation with validated measures of physical and psychological impairment and quality of life' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;They were assessed at baseline and one year after randomization with validated measures of physical and psychological impairment and quality of life.&quot;</span> [quote 7]

The full text mentions that validated measures of physical and psychological impairment and quality of life were used as primary outcome measures. There is no indication that surrogate or physiological outcomes were used. Therefore, it can be inferred that the trial's primary outcome was relevant to participants.

Score: [5]

Primary analysis:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;For each scale of the SF-36 and separately for the case and control group, we adopted a regression model in which score changes at the end of the follow-up period were adjusted for the baseline values.&quot;</span> [quote 8]

The full text describes the use of a regression model to analyze the primary outcome data, adjusting for baseline values. This suggests that all available data were included in the analysis, consistent with a pragmatic approach.

Eligibility:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants were non-institutionalized adults (age ⩾ 18 years) with severe MS and their primary carers. Other patient inclusion criteria were primary or secondary progressive MS,1,13 Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score ⩾ 8.0,14 complex symptoms,15 and ⩾2 unmet care needs.16 The carer (a family member, relative, or friend of the patient) was his or her next of kin and was designated by the patient except for patients with severe cognitive compromise.&quot;</span> <span style='background-color: #ffe9e2' title='Moved squared brackets during extraction'>Score: [4]</span> The eligibility criteria for this trial are fairly pragmatic, as they include a broad range of patients with severe MS and their primary carers. However, the exclusion of patients with severe cognitive compromise may limit the generalizability of the results to this population.

Recruitment:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants were non-institutionalized adults (age ⩾ 18 years) with severe MS and their primary carers.&quot;</span> <span style='background-color: #ffe9e2' title='Moved squared brackets during extraction'>Score: [4]</span> The recruitment strategy for this trial appears to be fairly pragmatic, as it targets non-institutionalized adults with severe MS and their primary carers. However, the full text does not provide specific details about the recruitment process, such as whether participants were recruited from multiple sites or how they were identified and approached.

Setting:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;In this randomized, examiner-blind, controlled study, we recruited patients from three Italian centers.&quot;</span> <span style='background-color: #ffe9e2' title='Moved squared brackets during extraction'>Score: [3]</span> The trial was conducted at three Italian centers, which suggests that the setting may be somewhat explanatory. However, without further information about the characteristics of these centers and how they compare to usual care settings, it is difficult to make a definitive assessment.

Organisation:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Based on the principles of PC,17 each center had a HPA team consisting of a physician (neurologist or physiatrist), a nurse (case manager and team leader), a psychologist, and a social worker.&quot;</span> <span style='background-color: #ffe9e2' title='Moved squared brackets during extraction'>Score: [4]</span> The organization of care delivery in the intervention arm of the trial appears to be fairly pragmatic, as it involves a multi-professional team that is consistent with usual care for palliative care. However, the full text does not provide specific details about any additional resources, provider expertise, or changes in care delivery that may be different from usual care.

Flexibility (delivery):
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;After a comprehensive assessment of the dyad needs based on direct observation and on visit 1 information (available via the eCRF), the HPA team defined the contents of the intervention, involving the dyad and the patient caring physician (the intervention was not intended to replace existing services).&quot;</span> <span style='background-color: #ffe9e2' title='Moved squared brackets during extraction'>Score: [4]</span> The flexibility in how the intervention is delivered appears to be fairly pragmatic, as it is based on a comprehensive assessment of the dyad's needs and involves collaboration with the patient's physician. However, the full text does not provide specific details about any strict protocols or measures to improve compliance that may be different from usual care.

Flexibility (adherence):
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;In the event of emergencies, dyads contacted the patient caring physician or emergency medical services.&quot;</span> <span style='background-color: #ffe9e2' title='Moved squared brackets during extraction'>Score: [5]</span> The flexibility in how participants must adhere to the intervention appears to be very pragmatic, as there are no specific requirements for adherence or measures to improve adherence mentioned in the full text. This domain may not be applicable to this trial, as there is no mention of compliance issues or specific interventions to improve adherence.

Follow-up:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;A blind examiner assessed dyads at baseline, 3 months, and 6 months.&quot;</span> <span style='background-color: #ffe9e2' title='Moved squared brackets during extraction'>Score: [4]</span> The intensity of measurement and follow-up of participants in the trial appears to be fairly pragmatic, as it involves assessments at baseline, 3 months, and 6 months. However, the full text does not provide specific details about the frequency or duration of these assessments compared to usual care.

Primary outcome:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Primary outcome measures were Palliative care Outcome Scale-Symptoms-MS (POS-S-MS) and Schedule for the Evaluation of Individual Quality of Life-Direct Weighting (SEIQoL-DW, not assessed in severely cognitively compromised patients).&quot;</span> <span style='background-color: #ffe9e2' title='Moved squared brackets during extraction'>Score: [4]</span> The primary outcome measures for this trial appear to be fairly pragmatic, as they include patient-reported outcomes that are relevant to participants with severe MS. However, the exclusion of severely cognitively compromised patients from the SEIQoL-DW assessment may limit the generalizability of the results to this population.

Primary analysis:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;All randomly assigned patients were included in the main intention-to-treat analysis, provided that at least one contact with the team occurred (HPA group).&quot;</span> <span style='background-color: #ffe9e2' title='Moved squared brackets during extraction'>Score: [5]</span> The primary analysis of the trial appears to be very pragmatic, as it includes all randomly assigned patients in the intention-to-treat analysis. There is no mention of any exclusions or restrictions on the data included in the analysis.

Overall, the trial appears to have a fairly pragmatic design, with some domains leaning more towards the explanatory end of the spectrum. The eligibility criteria, recruitment strategy, and primary outcome measures are all fairly pragmatic, while the setting, organization of care delivery, and flexibility in delivery are somewhat explanatory. The flexibility in adherence and the intensity of follow-up appear to be very pragmatic.</pre>

Eligibility:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Inclusion criteria for the study included (1) a diagnosis of MS, (2) not currently engaged in rehabilitation, therapy or PA program and able to undertake PA without risk-factors (3) aged between 18 and 65 (4) able to give informed consent and to understand French.&quot;</span> [1]
2. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;We excluded those who were receiving drug treatment for fatigue started less than three months ago or acute hospital or nursing home, those who were having psychiatric disorders.&quot;</span> [1]

The full text provides clear information on the eligibility criteria for the study, including the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The criteria are specific and relevant to the target population of people with MS. Based on this information, the trial appears to have a pragmatic approach to eligibility.

Score: [4]

Recruitment:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants were recruited from two hospitals in the Parisian region, in France receiving outpatient services for MS at a regional medical center.&quot;</span> [1]
2. <span title='Moderate quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 92.7%):

The full text provides limited information on the recruitment process. It mentions that participants were recruited from two hospitals and approached by the study coordinator, but it does not provide details on any additional efforts made to recruit participants or any specific recruitment strategies used. Based on the available information, it is difficult to determine the level of effort made to recruit participants beyond what would be used in usual care.

Score: [3]

Setting:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;This clinical and multicentric trial took place from July 2017 to January 2020, in two hospitals in the Parisian Region, France (Hospitals – CHI Poissy St Germain-en-Laye and R. Poincaré, Garches).&quot;</span> [1]

The full text provides information on the setting of the trial, which took place in two hospitals in the Parisian Region. However, it does not provide any details on how the settings of the trial compare to usual care settings. Without this information, it is difficult to assess the level of difference between the trial setting and usual care settings.

Score: [NA]

Organisation:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The PA program was manualized and available as a booklet.&quot;</span> [1]
2. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The PA program was delivered by a neurologist and a specialist in physical medicine and rehabilitation.&quot;</span> [1]

The full text provides limited information on the organization of care delivery in the intervention arm of the trial. It mentions that the PA program was manualized and delivered by a neurologist and a specialist in physical medicine and rehabilitation. However, it does not provide details on any additional resources, provider expertise, or changes in care delivery compared to usual care. Based on the available information, it is difficult to assess the level of difference in organization between the intervention arm and usual care.

Score: [3]

Flexibility (delivery):
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants in the control group were not guided to develop if-then plans and they did not receive any mindfulness training, however, they received the same PA program over a period of eight weeks.&quot;</span> [1]

The full text indicates that the control group did not receive any additional guidance or training beyond the PA program. This suggests that the delivery of the intervention in the control group was similar to usual care, with no additional flexibility or specific protocol. However, the text does not provide information on the flexibility in how the intervention was delivered in the intervention groups compared to usual care.

Score: [NA]

Flexibility (adherence):
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants were asked to develop a concrete if-then plan (the “if” component followed by the “then” component) once a week and share them through TailorBuilder app.&quot;</span> [1]

The full text provides information on the flexibility in how participants were asked to adhere to the intervention. They were asked to develop if-then plans once a week and share them through an app. This suggests that there was some flexibility in how participants were expected to adhere to the intervention. However, the text does not provide information on any measures to improve adherence or any exclusions based on adherence.

Score: [4]

Follow-up:
1. <span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 99.5%):

The primary outcomes, fatigue, mobility and quality of life, were examined at baseline prior to randomization, and then 8-weeks after the intervention (following the online intervention).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;The primary outcomes, fatigue, mobility, and quality of life, were examined at baseline prior to randomization, and then 8-weeks after the intervention (following the online intervention).&quot;</span> [1]

The full text provides information on the follow-up period, which was 8 weeks after the intervention. This suggests that the intensity of measurement and follow-up in the trial was similar to usual care, with no additional visits or measurements beyond what would typically be done. However, the text does not provide details on the specific measurements and follow-up procedures used.

Score: [4]

Primary outcome:
1. <span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 99.5%):

The primary outcomes, fatigue, mobility and quality of life, were examined at baseline prior to randomization, and then 8-weeks after the intervention (following the online intervention).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;The primary outcomes, fatigue, mobility, and quality of life, were examined at baseline prior to randomization, and then 8-weeks after the intervention (following the online intervention).&quot;</span> [1]

The full text provides information on the primary outcomes of the trial, which include fatigue, mobility, and quality of life. These outcomes are relevant to participants and are commonly assessed in MS trials. However, the text does not provide information on any use of surrogate or physiological outcomes, central adjudication, or assessment expertise that is not available in usual care.

Score: [5]

Primary analysis:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The Wilcoxon signed rank test showed a statistically significant difference in change scores across the three groups for the MSIS-29 physical component.&quot;</span> [1]

The full text provides limited information on the primary analysis of the trial. It mentions the use of the Wilcoxon signed rank test to assess differences in change scores across the three groups for the MSIS-29 physical component. However, it does not provide information on the inclusion of all available data in the analysis or any exclusions or restrictions in the analysis.

Eligibility:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;20 subjects with relapsing–remitting or progressive MS, 26–50 years of age, with EDSS ≤ 6 and EDSS pyramidal functions score (EDSSpyr) > 2 were enrolled in a randomized prospective study.&quot;</span> <span style='background-color: #ffe9e2' title='Moved squared brackets during extraction'>Score: [4]</span> The eligibility criteria for this trial are relatively pragmatic, as they include a broad range of MS patients with different disease types and severity. However, the exclusion of patients with EDSS pyramidal functions score (EDSSpyr) ≤ 2 may limit the generalizability of the results to patients with less severe disease.

Recruitment:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The participants were randomly divided into SC and yoga group.&quot;</span> <span style='background-color: #ffe9e2' title='Moved squared brackets during extraction'>Score: [4]</span> The randomization process used in this trial suggests a pragmatic approach to recruitment. However, the full text does not provide information on how participants were recruited or whether any additional efforts were made to engage with patients beyond usual care.

Setting:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;SC took place in the Training, Occupation and Care Centre under the supervision of two SC instructors with a Slovenian Sports Climbing Committee License.&quot;</span> <span style='background-color: #ffe9e2' title='Moved squared brackets during extraction'>Score: [3]</span> The trial was conducted in a specialized setting, the Training, Occupation and Care Centre, which may limit the generalizability of the results to usual care settings. However, the use of licensed SC instructors suggests some level of standardization and expertise in the delivery of the intervention.

Organisation:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The climbing wall with an inclination of 90° and the height of 5 m was adjusted for patients with physical disabilities by adding numerous and bigger holds.&quot;</span> <span style='background-color: #ffe9e2' title='Moved squared brackets during extraction'>Score: [4]</span> The trial made adjustments to the climbing wall to accommodate patients with physical disabilities, which suggests a pragmatic approach to the organization of care delivery. However, the full text does not provide information on whether any additional resources or training were provided to the staff involved in delivering the intervention.

Flexibility (delivery):
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;All patients were belayed with the “top rope” system, which provided a safe climbing opportunity with the possibility to rest in the wall at any point.&quot;</span> <span style='background-color: #ffe9e2' title='Moved squared brackets during extraction'>Score: [4]</span> The use of the "top rope" system and the ability for patients to rest during climbing suggest a pragmatic approach to the flexibility in how the intervention is delivered. However, the full text does not provide information on whether there were any restrictions or guidelines on how the intervention should be delivered beyond the use of the "top rope" system.

Flexibility (adherence):
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;There were no significant improvements in spasticity after SC and yoga.&quot;</span> <span style='background-color: #ffe9e2' title='Moved squared brackets during extraction'>Score: [NA]</span> This domain is not applicable to this trial as there is no compliance issue after consent has been given.

Follow-up:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Both programs were held once a week for 10 weeks.&quot;</span> <span style='background-color: #ffe9e2' title='Moved squared brackets during extraction'>Score: [4]</span> The duration and frequency of the intervention suggest a pragmatic approach to the intensity of measurement and follow-up. However, the full text does not provide information on whether there were any additional measurements or follow-up visits beyond the assessment before and after the programs.

Primary outcome:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;There were no significant improvements in spasticity after SC and yoga.&quot;</span> <span style='background-color: #ffe9e2' title='Moved squared brackets during extraction'>Score: [4]</span> The primary outcome of spasticity is relevant to participants as it is a common symptom in MS. However, the lack of significant improvements suggests that the trial may have used a more explanatory approach in measuring the primary outcome.

Primary analysis:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Data were analyzed by SPSS program for Windows®, version 17.0. Wilcoxon signed ranks test was used to compare the difference before and after each program.&quot;</span> <span style='background-color: #ffe9e2' title='Moved squared brackets during extraction'>Score: [4]</span> The use of intention-to-treat analysis and the inclusion of all available data in the analysis suggest a pragmatic approach to the primary analysis.

<p><i><span style="border-bottom: 1px dashed black;">10 quote(s) from
publication full text</span> (mean similarity 100%)</i></p>
<pre>
Eligibility:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;MS patients older than 18 years who had a confirmed MS with spasticity of the lower limbs and an Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) between 4 and 6.5 were eligible for inclusion.&quot;</span> [1]
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Patients who had received hippotherapy within the last 12 months, a body weight over 90 kg, no balance while sitting, and acute exacerbation during the 4-week period before start of the therapy were excluded.&quot;</span> [1]
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;A planned start of treatment with new anti-spastic drugs or other medications that may have an influence on the assessed outcomes also resulted in exclusion.&quot;</span> [1]

The eligibility criteria for this trial appear to be relatively pragmatic. The inclusion criteria are specific to MS patients with spasticity of the lower limbs and an EDSS score between 4 and 6.5. The exclusion criteria are reasonable and do not appear to overly restrict the participant population. Overall, the trial seems to have a pragmatic approach to participant eligibility.

Score: [4]

Recruitment:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;A total of 70 adults with MS were recruited in five German centers and randomly allocated to the intervention group (12 weeks of hippotherapy) or the control group.&quot;</span> [1]

The recruitment process is not described in detail in the full text. However, it is mentioned that 70 adults with MS were recruited in five German centers. The recruitment process does not appear to involve any additional efforts beyond what would be used in usual care. Therefore, it can be considered relatively pragmatic.

Score: [4]

Setting:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The study was conducted at five sites in Germany, all of which have hippotherapy experience as stipulated by the rules of the German Consortium for Therapeutic Riding.&quot;</span> [1]

The trial was conducted at five sites in Germany, which suggests a relatively pragmatic choice of settings. However, it is not clear if these sites are representative of usual care settings for MS patients. Without further information, it is difficult to fully assess the setting domain.

Score: [NA]

Organisation:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Patients in the control group continued their previous therapy. Over the study period, symptomatic drug treatment, immunotherapy, and physiotherapy were kept unchanged in both groups.&quot;</span> [1]

The trial appears to have a pragmatic approach to the organization of care delivery. The control group continued their previous therapy, and there were no changes to symptomatic drug treatment, immunotherapy, and physiotherapy in either group. This suggests that the trial used resources and care delivery methods that are consistent with usual care.

Score: [5]

Flexibility (delivery):
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Patients of the intervention group received hippotherapy (as defined by the regulations for hippotherapy of the Deutsches Kuratorium für Therapeutisches Reiten e.V. (DKThR)) once a week for 12 weeks as an add-on therapy to their standard care, which remained unchanged.&quot;</span> [1]

The intervention group received hippotherapy once a week for 12 weeks as an add-on therapy to their standard care, which remained unchanged. This suggests a relatively pragmatic approach to the delivery of the intervention, as it aligns with usual care practices.

Score: [5]

Flexibility (adherence):
- This domain is not applicable to this trial as there is no mention of adherence issues or measures to improve adherence.

Score: [NA]

Follow-up:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Examinations and questionnaires were completed prior to the first hippotherapy session (baseline), after 6–7 weeks (interim assessment) and after 12 weeks (final assessment).&quot;</span> [1]

The trial had follow-up assessments at baseline, after 6-7 weeks, and after 12 weeks. This suggests a pragmatic approach to the intensity of measurement and follow-up, as it aligns with usual care practices.

Score: [5]

Primary outcome:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Primary outcome was the change in the Berg Balance Scale (BBS) after 12 weeks.&quot;</span> [1]

The primary outcome of the trial, the change in the Berg Balance Scale after 12 weeks, appears to be relevant to participants. The BBS is a measure of balance function, which is likely important to MS patients. Therefore, the trial can be considered relatively pragmatic in terms of the primary outcome.

Score: [5]

Primary analysis:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Analyses were based on the modified intention-to-treat set (modified ITT). This set encompasses all randomized patients with valid baseline assessment.&quot;</span> [1]

The trial used a modified intention-to-treat analysis, which includes all randomized patients with valid baseline assessment. This suggests a pragmatic approach to the analysis of the primary outcome, as it includes all available data.

Score: [5]</pre>

<pre>
Eligibility:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants: One hundred and fourteen people with progressive neurological conditions recruited from general practices in Nottingham, including 53 with Parkinson's disease and 45 with multiple sclerosis&quot;</span> [1]
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants eligible for inclusion were adults aged over 15 years with one of the following possible recorded diagnoses: MS, PD and other causes of progressive parkinsonism, motor neurone disease, Huntington's disease and other degenerative disorders affecting the central nervous system, muscles or peripheral nerves.&quot;</span> [2]

The full text provides clear information about the eligibility criteria for the trial. It states that participants were adults with specific progressive neurological conditions. The inclusion criteria are well-defined and specific, allowing for a clear understanding of the target population. Therefore, the trial can be considered pragmatic in terms of eligibility.

Score: [5]

Recruitment:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;From July 1998 we approached the 177 GPs based within the City of Nottingham boundaries (population 282000). Participants eligible for inclusion were adults aged over 15 years with one of the following possible recorded diagnoses: MS, PD and other causes of progressive parkinsonism, motor neurone disease, Huntington's disease and other degenerative disorders affecting the central nervous system, muscles or peripheral nerves.&quot;</span> [2]

The full text does not provide specific information about the recruitment process. It mentions approaching GPs and the target population, but it does not provide details about the efforts made to recruit participants or any specific recruitment strategies used. Therefore, it is difficult to assess the recruitment domain based on the information provided.

Score: [NA]

Setting:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Setting: Participants' homes in the City of Nottingham.&quot;</span> [1]

The full text clearly states that the trial took place in participants' homes in the City of Nottingham. This suggests that the setting of the trial closely resembles the usual care setting for individuals with progressive neurological conditions. Therefore, the trial can be considered pragmatic in terms of setting.

Score: [5]

Organisation:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The concept of the expert patient arises from the demand for information to assist people in their self-management of chronic diseases. There is some evidence that education can benefit people with non-neurological conditions and with progressive neurological conditions.&quot;</span> [2]

The full text mentions the concept of the expert patient and the provision of education to assist individuals in self-management. However, it does not provide specific information about any additional resources, provider expertise, or changes in care delivery organization in the intervention arm of the trial. Therefore, it is difficult to assess the organization domain based on the information provided.

Score: [NA]

Flexibility (delivery):
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;In the education group (EG), baseline data were reviewed by an expert panel which advised on actions most likely to promote each individual's physical, social and psychological well-being. An occupational therapist (OT) then visited EG participants to provide education and information and to discuss a personalized 12-month health action plan.&quot;</span> [1]

The full text describes the delivery of the intervention in the education group, which involved a personalized visit from an occupational therapist to provide education and information. This suggests that there was some flexibility in how the intervention was delivered to meet the individual needs of participants. Therefore, the trial can be considered pragmatic in terms of delivery flexibility.

Score: [4]

Flexibility (adherence):
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants could have been disadvantaged by the lack of a professional mentor to support actions prompted by the educational intervention. There is ample evidence that professionally mediated assessments and interventions can reduce the frequency of falls.&quot;</span> [2]

The full text mentions the lack of a professional mentor to support actions prompted by the educational intervention. This suggests that there may have been some flexibility in how participants were expected to adhere to the intervention. However, it does not provide specific information about any measures to improve adherence or any exclusion based on adherence. Therefore, it is difficult to fully assess the adherence domain based on the information provided.

Score: [NA]

Follow-up:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants were assessed at baseline and 12 months later.&quot;</span> [2]

The full text mentions that participants were assessed at baseline and 12 months later. However, it does not provide specific information about the intensity of measurement and follow-up compared to usual care. Therefore, it is difficult to fully assess the follow-up domain based on the information provided.

Score: [NA]

Primary outcome:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;To test the effects of a home-based educational intervention in reducing the incidence and the risk of falls and pressure sores in adults with progressive neurological conditions.&quot;</span> [1]

The full text clearly states that the primary outcome of the trial was to reduce the incidence and risk of falls and pressure sores in adults with progressive neurological conditions. This suggests that the primary outcome is relevant to the participants and of obvious importance to them. Therefore, the trial can be considered pragmatic in terms of the primary outcome.

Score: [5]

Primary analysis:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The EG reported significantly more falls during the follow-up period and at 12 months&quot;</span> [...] <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;There was no difference between CoG and EG in the Nottingham Extended Activities of Daily Living score, but EG patients showed a significant rise in this score over the study period.&quot;</span> [1]

The full text does not provide specific information about the primary analysis conducted in the trial. It mentions the results of the analysis, but it does not provide details about the inclusion of all data or any exclusions. Therefore, it is difficult to fully assess the primary analysis domain based on the information provided.

<p><i><span style="border-bottom: 1px dashed black;">11 quote(s) from
publication full text</span> (mean similarity 100%)</i></p>
<pre>
Eligibility:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Inclusion criteria were the following: diagnosis of MS made by a neurologist, able to walk 10 meters with or without an aid within 2 minutes, no relapse of their MS in the past 4 weeks, and no other neurological or orthopedic condition that would affect their function.&quot;</span> [1]
2. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Eligible participants were excluded from the study if they were already engaged in a formal exercise program lasting >30 minutes twice per week, experienced an exacerbation within the past 4 weeks, had their MS immunomodulation medications altered in the previous 4 weeks or during the trial period, or declined to be randomly allocated.&quot;</span> [1]

The eligibility criteria for this trial appear to be relatively pragmatic. The inclusion criteria are straightforward and align with typical characteristics of people with MS who would be eligible for this type of intervention. The exclusion criteria are also reasonable and do not overly restrict the population that would receive this intervention in usual care. Score: [4]

Recruitment:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Community dwelling people with MS were recruited through the Multiple Sclerosis Society of New South Wales and South Australia.&quot;</span> [1]

The recruitment strategy for this trial involved recruiting participants from the community through a well-established organization that supports people with MS. This approach is likely to be similar to how participants would be recruited in usual care. Score: [5]

Setting:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The group program was conducted at a local community center and included four to six participants per class.&quot;</span> [1]
2. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Home exercise participants were provided with one center-based physiotherapist-led session at the commencement of the intervention period for training, and telephone support by a physiotherapist to discuss their program every 2 weeks.&quot;</span> [1]

The trial was conducted in both a community center and participants' homes, which reflects a pragmatic approach to the setting. The use of a community center allows for group-based exercise sessions, which may be more accessible and cost-effective for participants. The home-based intervention also aligns with usual care, as many individuals with MS may prefer to exercise at home. Score: [4]

Organization:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The group program was conducted at a local community center and included four to six participants per class. Groups were led by a physiotherapist employed by the Multiple Sclerosis Society who received training to ensure a standard approach to intervention, intensity, and progression.&quot;</span> [1]
2. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Home exercise participants were provided with one center-based physiotherapist-led session at the commencement of the intervention period for training, and telephone support by a physiotherapist to discuss their program every 2 weeks.&quot;</span> [1]

The organization of care delivery in both the group and home-based interventions appears to be pragmatic. The group program was led by a physiotherapist who received training to ensure consistency in the intervention. The home-based participants also received initial training and ongoing support from a physiotherapist. These approaches align with usual care and do not involve significant increases in resources or staff levels. Score: [4]

Flexibility (delivery):
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The exercise program for both groups included two, 60-minute sessions per week, held at least 2 days apart for 8 weeks.&quot;</span> [1]
2. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Exercises were aimed at improving gait speed, endurance, and balance. They were individualized, specific, progressed in load, and performed at a moderate to high intensity.&quot;</span> [1]

The delivery of the intervention appears to be pragmatic in terms of flexibility. The exercise program was individualized and progressed in load, allowing for adaptation to each participant's needs. The frequency and duration of the sessions are also reasonable and align with what would be feasible in usual care. Score: [4]

Flexibility (adherence):
This domain is not applicable to this trial as there is no compliance issue after consent has been given. Score: [NA]

Follow-up:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants attended a local community center to complete all assessments at pre-intervention (week 0), post-intervention (week 8), and at follow-up (week 16).&quot;</span> [1]

The follow-up assessments were conducted at a local community center, which is likely similar to the setting where participants would receive usual care. The timing of the assessments (pre-intervention, post-intervention, and follow-up) also aligns with what would be feasible in usual care. Score: [5]

Primary outcome:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The primary outcome was gait speed (10-meter walk test).&quot;</span> [1]

The primary outcome of gait speed is relevant to participants with MS as it directly measures their mobility and functional ability. This outcome is of obvious importance to participants and aligns with what would be assessed in usual care. Score: [5]

Primary analysis:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Data were analyzed according to the intention-to-treat principle.&quot;</span> [1]

The analysis of the primary outcome was conducted according to the intention-to-treat principle, which is a pragmatic approach that includes all randomized participants and reflects how the intervention would be evaluated in usual care. Score: [5]</pre>

The full text provides information about the primary outcome of the trial, which is weight loss. The intervention group lost significantly more weight than the comparator group at 12 weeks and maintained this weight loss at 12 months. The intervention group also demonstrated greater improvements in other clinical measures, physical activity, diet, and self-rated health. The primary outcome is relevant to the participants and is measured at a similar time frame to usual care. Score: [5]

Primary analysis:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;We analyzed outcome data to examine the potential effectiveness of the Hockey FIT program on the basis of an intent-to-treat approach.&quot;</span> [2]
2. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;We ran an additional linear mixed-effects model within the intervention group only to obtain exploratory estimates for mean change from baseline to 12 months.&quot;</span> [2]
3. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;We analyzed the data using likelihood-based methods, which are well known to provide unbiased results under the more general assumption of missing at random.&quot;</span> [4]

The full text provides information about the primary analysis of the trial. The outcome data were analyzed using an intent-to-treat approach, which is a pragmatic approach that includes all randomized participants regardless of compliance with the intervention. An additional analysis was conducted within the intervention group to obtain exploratory estimates for mean change from baseline to 12 months. The analysis methods used are appropriate for a pragmatic trial. Score: [5]</pre>

<pre>
Eligibility:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;We selected 156 pregnant women in their ≥ 37 week/s, who had cervical dilations of ≥ 4 cm and with two or more contractions in 10 minutes.&quot;</span> [Quote 1]
2. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Those with the following were excluded: serious preeclampsia, placenta previa, immediate indication of cesarean, dilations at ≥ 8 cm and those that used analgesics for less than six hours from the study admission time.&quot;</span> [Quote 2]
3. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The size of the sample was estimated through considering the proposed calculation method for the non-paired 14 t test.&quot;</span> [Quote 3]

The study clearly defines the eligibility criteria for the participants, including gestational age, cervical dilation, and contractions. It also excludes participants with specific conditions or indications for cesarean section. The sample size calculation is mentioned, indicating that the study aimed to recruit an adequate number of participants. Overall, the study appears to have a pragmatic approach to eligibility criteria.

Score: [4]

Recruitment:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The pregnant women were randomly divided into three groups at a university hospital in the suburbs of Sao Paulo, Brazil, in order to receive either acupressure treatment, a placebo or participate as part of a control group.&quot;</span> [Quote 1]
2. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The study used the single-blind method (participants in the SP6 and TG groups did not know what group they were in).&quot;</span> [Quote 2]

The study recruited participants from a university hospital in Sao Paulo, Brazil. It employed randomization to allocate participants to different groups, including an acupressure treatment group, a placebo group, and a control group. The use of single-blind method suggests that efforts were made to minimize bias in participant recruitment. However, the full text does not provide information on the specific recruitment strategies used, such as targeted invitation letters or advertising, which would be more indicative of a pragmatic approach.

Score: [3]

Setting:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;We undertook a controlled and randomized clinical test (based on the consort diagram) employing the use of pragmatism. It was carried out between January and August of 2013. The subjects were pregnant women admitted to a teaching tertiary public hospital on the outskirts of the state of Sao Paulo, Brazil.&quot;</span> [Quote 1]

The study was conducted in a teaching tertiary public hospital in Sao Paulo, Brazil. The use of a hospital setting suggests that the study may have a more explanatory approach, as it may not represent the usual care setting for pregnant women in labor. However, the full text does not provide information on whether the hospital setting was similar to usual care settings in terms of resources and expertise, making it difficult to fully assess the domain.

Score: [NA]

Organisation:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The researcher that was responsible for applying the acupressure went through 32 hours' worth of training.&quot;</span> [Quote 1]
2. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The pregnant women in labor obtained normal obstetrical treatment. Where the study was carried out, the following was permitted: the presence of someone to accompany the pregnant lady, the use of methods other than drugs such as taking a shower, massages in the lower back region and breathing exercises as well as liberty of movement (in cases where this did not go against medical advice).&quot;</span> [Quote 2]

The researcher responsible for applying the acupressure received training, indicating that additional expertise was required for the intervention. The study also mentions that the pregnant women received normal obstetrical treatment, including the presence of a support person and the use of non-drug methods for pain relief. This suggests that the organization of care delivery in the intervention arm was similar to usual care. However, the full text does not provide information on whether additional resources or staff levels were required for the intervention, making it difficult to fully assess the domain.

Score: [NA]

Flexibility (delivery):
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The SP6 group with the pregnant women in labor received deep pressure (± 5kg) with fast decompression applied to their thumbs which did not bring about any discomfort.&quot;</span> [Quote 1]

The acupressure intervention in the study involved applying deep pressure to the SP6 point on the thumbs of the pregnant women in labor. The description suggests that there was a specific protocol for delivering the intervention, indicating a more explanatory approach with strict guidelines for delivery.

Score: [2]

Flexibility (adherence):
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The pregnant women in labor where encouraged during the CB to breath in and out deeply in the direction of the thorax during the contractions and the intervals in orde for their bodies to be totally relaxed (slow thorax-abdomen breathing rhythm).&quot;</span> [Quote 1]

The full text does not provide information on any specific requirements or measures to improve adherence to the intervention. However, it mentions that the pregnant women were encouraged to practice deep breathing during contractions and intervals. This suggests that there may not have been strict requirements for adherence to the intervention, indicating a more pragmatic approach.

Score: [4]

Follow-up:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;VAS was used to evaluate the pain and for pre-developed questions. The women were able to classify their perception of the pain.&quot;</span> [Quote 1]

The study used the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) to measure pain and collected data at multiple time points, including before the treatment, 20 minutes after the treatment, and 60 minutes after the treatment. The use of multiple time points for data collection suggests a more explanatory approach with more intensive measurement and follow-up compared to usual care.

Score: [2]

Primary outcome:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The results show that the use of acupressure on the SP6 point is a complementary method that is non-invasive and can alleviate pain during childbirth, without presenting any adverse effects for pregnant women in labor and neonate women.&quot;</span> [Quote 1]

The primary outcome of the study was the alleviation of pain during childbirth through the use of acupressure on the SP6 point. The outcome is directly relevant to the participants and addresses a key concern in usual care. The study provides evidence that the intervention can achieve the desired outcome, suggesting a more pragmatic approach.

Score: [5]

Primary analysis:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;There were statistical differences (p<0.0001, Fridman test) in the VAS values for each group for the three times when the evaluations were done.&quot;</span> [Quote 1]

The full text does not provide detailed information on the primary analysis of the data, such as whether intention-to-treat analysis was used or if all available data were included. However, it mentions that there were statistical differences in the VAS values for each group at multiple time points. Without further information, it is difficult to fully assess the domain.

<p><i><span style="border-bottom: 1px dashed black;">11 quote(s) from
publication full text</span> (mean similarity 100%)</i></p>
<pre>
Eligibility:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Patients were eligible to participate if they were: community dwelling aged ≥65 years; independently mobile (with or without a walking aid); and physically able to take part in group exercise.&quot;</span> [1]
2. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Patients were excluded if they: had experienced ≥3 falls in the previous year; had unstable clinical conditions; would be unable to follow instructions about exercise safely; or were receiving palliative care.&quot;</span> [1]

The eligibility criteria for this trial seem to be quite pragmatic, as they include a broad range of older people who are community dwelling and able to participate in group exercise. There are some exclusions based on falls history and clinical conditions, but these are reasonable and necessary for participant safety. Score: [4]

Recruitment:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Practices were recruited with assistance from Primary Care Research Networks for London, Derby, and Nottingham. Patients aged ≥65 years were identified by searches of computerised medical records and invited to participate by letter from their GP.&quot;</span> [1]

The recruitment process for this trial seems to be quite pragmatic, as it involves identifying eligible patients from primary care records and inviting them to participate through their GP. This is a common and feasible approach that would be used in usual care. Score: [5]

Setting:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Pragmatic three-arm, parallel-design cluster randomised controlled trial involving 1256 people aged ≥65 years (of 20 507 invited) recruited from 43 general practices in London, Nottingham, and Derby.&quot;</span> [1]

The trial was conducted in general practices in London, Nottingham, and Derby, which are typical settings for primary care. This suggests a pragmatic approach to the setting, as it involves multiple sites that are representative of usual care. Score: [5]

Organisation:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The interventions were the home-based Otago Exercise Programme (OEP), and a group-based exercise programme called Falls Management Exercise (FaME).&quot;</span> [1]
2. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Volunteer peer mentors supported participants in the OEP arm, and weekly FaME classes were run in local venues by postural stability instructors trained to work with older people.&quot;</span> [1]

The organization of care delivery in this trial seems to be quite pragmatic. The interventions were designed to be feasible and deliverable in a primary care setting, with the OEP being home-based and the FaME classes being run in local venues. The use of volunteer peer mentors and postural stability instructors also suggests a pragmatic approach to utilizing available resources. Score: [4]

Flexibility (delivery):
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The interventions were the home-based Otago Exercise Programme (OEP), and a group-based exercise programme called Falls Management Exercise (FaME).&quot;</span> [1]
2. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The programmes included the following progression: OEP — ankle weights and hand holds; and FaME — resistance bands and hand holds, plus a move to more dynamic balance work and floor work with postural stability instructors.&quot;</span> [1]

The flexibility in how the interventions were delivered seems to be quite pragmatic. The OEP and FaME programs included different exercises and progressions, allowing for individual tailoring and adaptation based on participant needs and capabilities. Score: [4]

Flexibility (adherence):
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Adherence was defined as (minutes spent exercising/intended minutes) 100%, where patients with values exceeding 75% were regarded as ‘adherent’.&quot;</span> [1]

The trial did not explicitly mention any measures or interventions to improve adherence, but it did define adherence as a percentage of intended minutes spent exercising. This suggests a pragmatic approach to adherence, as it allows for some flexibility and recognizes that participants may not always meet the intended minutes. Score: [3]

Follow-up:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants were followed up every 6 months after the end of the intervention period, until 24 months.&quot;</span> [1]

The follow-up schedule for this trial seems to be quite pragmatic, as it involves regular follow-up visits every 6 months for up to 24 months. This is a reasonable and feasible approach that would be used in usual care. Score: [4]

Primary outcome:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The primary outcome was the proportion of participants who reported reaching ≥150 minutes of MVPA per week.&quot;</span> [1]

The primary outcome of this trial seems to be quite pragmatic, as it focuses on a relevant and meaningful outcome for participants - reaching the recommended physical activity target. This is a patient-centered outcome that is of obvious importance to participants. Score: [5]

Primary analysis:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants were analysed in the groups to which they were randomised, regardless of whether they received the intervention or not, and multiple imputation was used to include all participants in the analyses.&quot;</span> [1]

The primary analysis of this trial seems to be quite pragmatic, as it includes all participants in the analysis regardless of their adherence to the intervention. This intention-to-treat approach is commonly used in pragmatic trials and allows for a more realistic assessment of the intervention's effectiveness. Score: [5]</pre>

<pre>
Eligibility:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;only patients who could walk with or without walking aids were admitted to the trial&quot;</span> [1]
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Patients with diabetes mellitus or hypertension or who gave a history of psychiatric illness or peptic ulcer were not admitted to the treated group&quot;</span> [1]

The eligibility criteria for this trial were relatively restrictive, as only patients who could walk and did not have certain comorbidities were included. This suggests a more explanatory approach with exclusions based on specific characteristics. 

Score: [2]

Recruitment:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Patients with multiple sclerosis were randomly selected into treated and control groups&quot;</span> [1]
- <span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 97.2%):

It could not be a doubleblind study' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;It could not be a double-blind study&quot;</span> [1]

The recruitment process involved random selection into treated and control groups, which suggests a pragmatic approach. However, the fact that it could not be a double-blind study indicates some limitations in terms of blinding and potential for bias.

Score: [4]

Setting:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;This controlled study was started in 1963 in three cities- Belfast, Leeds, and Manchester&quot;</span> [1]

The trial was conducted in three different cities, which suggests a more pragmatic approach with a broader range of settings.

Score: [4]

Organisation:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Both treated and control groups were given aneurin 100 mg. by injection monthly&quot;</span> [1]
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Nearly all patients treated with corticotrophin showed a slight rise in blood-pressure and a gain in weight&quot;</span> [1]

The organization of care delivery in the intervention arm involved regular injections and monitoring of blood pressure and weight. This suggests some differences in resources and monitoring compared to usual care.

Score: [3]

Flexibility (delivery):
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The dose of corticotrophin was adjusted to produce just enough 'mooning' of the face to be appreciated by the physician in charge of the trial&quot;</span> [1]
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The dose was not increased during a relapse&quot;</span> [1]

The delivery of the intervention involved adjusting the dose of corticotrophin based on specific criteria. This suggests a more explanatory approach with a strict protocol and monitoring.

Score: [2]

Flexibility (adherence):
- Not applicable, as there is no mention of adherence issues in this trial.

Score: [NA]

Follow-up:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;All cases were seen at three-monthly intervals and scored on the Kurtzke scale&quot;</span> [1]
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Relapses lasting longer than twenty-four hours were also scored by a system in the three centres&quot;</span> [1]

The follow-up involved regular assessments and scoring of patients at three-monthly intervals, as well as monitoring of relapses. This suggests a pragmatic approach with regular and relevant measurements.

Score: [4]

Primary outcome:
- <span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 99.1%):

There was no evidence that treatment prevented deterioration or reduced the number or severity of the relapses' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;There is no evidence that treatment prevented deterioration or reduced the number or severity of the relapses&quot;</span> [1]

The primary outcome of the trial was the prevention of deterioration and reduction in relapses, which are relevant outcomes for participants. However, the results showed no evidence of effectiveness.

Score: [5]

Primary analysis:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The total results were obtained by adding the results from the three cities; this was considered justifiable since the methods of selection, treatment, and scoring were essentially the same&quot;</span> [1]

The primary analysis included all available data from the three cities, which suggests an intention-to-treat approach with all data included.

Score: [5]</pre>

Eligibility:
- <span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 98.7%):

Only patients with a clinical or laboraton- supported definite diagnosis of MS according to the Poser criteria (6), suffering from a relapse, were included.' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;Only patients with a clinical or laboratory-supported definite diagnosis of MS according to the Poser criteria, suffering from a relapse, were included.&quot;</span> [1]
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Patients with contraindications to bed rest or ACTH-treatment, such as hypersensitivity to ACTH, acute infections, cardial insufficiency, psychosis, pregnancy, Cushing syndrome or peptic ulcer, were excluded.&quot;</span> [1]

The eligibility criteria for this trial seem to be quite pragmatic, as they include patients with a definite diagnosis of MS and a relapse, while excluding those with contraindications to the treatment. However, it is unclear if there were any additional exclusions or selection tests not mentioned in the text. Score: [4]

Recruitment:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Only 29 patients entered the trial. The number of patients was much smaller than was hoped for when the study was envisaged. This was due to a changing attitude towards bed rest and the introduction of short term high dose methylprednisolone treatment, which rapidly has gained a wide acceptance among neurologists.&quot;</span> [2]

The recruitment efforts for this trial seem to be more explanatory than pragmatic, as the number of patients enrolled was smaller than expected and there was a changing attitude towards the treatment being studied. It is unclear if any extra efforts were made to recruit participants beyond usual care practices. Score: [2]

Setting:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Three neurological departments in the Netherlands participated in this study.&quot;</span> [3]

The setting of this trial seems to be quite explanatory, as it was conducted in only three neurological departments in the Netherlands. It does not mention if the settings were similar to usual care settings or if they were specialized trial or academic centers. Score: [2]

Organisation:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;There were no statistically significant differences between both patient groups at the start of treatment.&quot;</span> [4]
- <span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 99.5%):

Side effects, like a mild raise of bloodpressure. mild diabetes mellitus, Cushing face, mood alterations, urinary tract infection, were significantly more often seen in the ACTH group.' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;Side effects, like a mild raise of blood pressure, mild diabetes mellitus, Cushing face, mood alterations, urinary tract infection, were significantly more often seen in the ACTH group.&quot;</span> [5]

Based on the information provided, it is unclear if there were any differences in the resources, provider expertise, or organization of care delivery between the intervention arm of the trial and usual care. The only mention of differences is in the occurrence of side effects, but it does not provide details on any additional resources or training provided in the intervention arm. Score: [NA]

Flexibility (delivery):
- No relevant quotes or information provided.

There is no information provided in the full text to assess the flexibility in how the intervention is delivered and the flexibility likely in usual care. Score: [NA]

Flexibility (adherence):
- No relevant quotes or information provided.

There is no information provided in the full text to assess the flexibility in how participants must adhere to the intervention and the flexibility likely in usual care. Score: [NA]

Follow-up:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Follow-up was performed in the 6th and 12th week of treatment and 6, 9, and 12 months after the start of treatment.&quot;</span> [6]

The follow-up schedule for this trial seems to be quite pragmatic, with assessments performed at regular intervals up to 12 months after the start of treatment. It does not mention if the intensity of measurement and follow-up was different from usual care. Score: [4]

Primary outcome:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Our results showed a greater improvement in some symptoms of relapse in MS patients after 6 or more weeks in the ACTH-treated patients. This difference did not outlast 6 months in any respect.&quot;</span> [7]

Based on the information provided, it seems that the primary outcome of this trial is relevant to the participants, as it measures the improvement in symptoms of relapse. There is no mention of using surrogate or physiological outcomes that are not available in usual care. Score: [5]

Primary analysis:
- <span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 99.2%):

MannWhitney U tests revealed a statistically significant greater improvementin the ACTH group in the brain stem and sensory FS, the ISS and in the Ambulation Index, but at 6 months none of these significant differences were still present.' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;Mann-Whitney U tests revealed a statistically significant greater improvement in the ACTH group in the brain stem and sensory FS, the ISS and in the Ambulation Index, but at 6 months none of these significant differences were still present.&quot;</span> [8]

Based on the information provided, it seems that the primary analysis of this trial included all available data and used intention-to-treat analysis. There is no mention of excluding ineligible post-randomization participants or including only completers or those following the treatment protocol. Score: [5]</pre>

publication full text</span> (mean similarity 100%)</i></p>
<pre>
Eligibility:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The patient inclusion criteria included a confirmed disease diagnosis by a neurologist, according to Mc-Donald criteria (McDonald, 2001); ability to walk (with or without aid) at least 20 m without rest; absence of other diseases that might have affected muscle function.&quot;</span> 
2. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants were randomly assigned to two different groups, the exercise group (EG) or the control group (CG).&quot;</span>

The eligibility criteria for this trial are clearly described in the full text. Participants were required to have a confirmed diagnosis of multiple sclerosis, be able to walk at least 20 meters without rest, and not have any other diseases that might affect muscle function. The random assignment of participants to the exercise group and control group also suggests that the trial aimed to include a representative sample of MS patients. Score: [4]

Recruitment:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;All participants were recruited among six MS rehabilitation centers within the region of Castilla y León (Spain).&quot;</span>
2. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;After a group meeting where the details of the investigation were described to the patients, including possible risks and discomfort associated to the intervention, a formal invitation to take part in the study was offered.&quot;</span>

The recruitment process for this trial involved recruiting participants from multiple MS rehabilitation centers. The full text does not provide information on any additional efforts made to recruit participants beyond the usual care setting. However, it does mention that a group meeting was held to provide information about the study and invite patients to participate. Based on this information, it can be inferred that some effort was made to engage with patients and recruit them for the trial. Score: [3]

Setting:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;All training sessions took place in MS rehabilitation centers and the patients were continuously supervised by physical therapists.&quot;</span>

The setting of the trial was in MS rehabilitation centers, which suggests that it closely resembled the usual care setting for MS patients. The fact that the training sessions took place in these centers and that patients were supervised by physical therapists further supports the pragmatic nature of the trial setting. Score: [5]

Organisation:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The EG, which included 16 women and 14 men (49.6 ± 11.0 yr), performed 12 weeks of resistance training followed by a detraining period where resistance exercise or other structured physical activity was avoided.&quot;</span>
2. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;A 12-week resistance training program similar to the one described in this study was offered to CG after completion of the intervention.&quot;</span>

The organization of care delivery in the intervention arm of the trial involved a 12-week resistance training program followed by a detraining period. The control group did not receive any specific intervention during the study period but was offered the same resistance training program after completion of the intervention. This suggests that the trial closely aligned with usual care in terms of the organization of care delivery. Score: [5]

Flexibility (delivery):
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Subjects performed coupled concentric-eccentric bilateral seated knee extension training using a weight stack machine (BH® Fitness Nevada Pro-T, Spain) twice per week during 12 weeks, with at least 48 h of rest between sessions.&quot;</span>
2. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;After a standardized cycling warm-up, and one set of 5 repetitions (reps) with a light load, participants performed 3 sets of 8–12 reps with a load that was progressively increased from 35 to 70% of MVIC through the training period.&quot;</span>

The delivery of the intervention involved a specific protocol for resistance training using a weight stack machine. The protocol included a standardized warm-up, specific sets and repetitions, and progressive increases in load over the 12-week training period. This suggests that there was a strict protocol for how the intervention was delivered, which may limit the flexibility compared to usual care. Score: [2]

Flexibility (adherence):
Not applicable. The full text does not mention any specific measures to improve adherence or any issues related to adherence in this trial. Score: [NA]

Follow-up:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Testing was performed on three different occasions: before (week 0) and after (week 12) the training program, and after the detraining period (week 24).&quot;</span>
2. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;All subjects taking part in the study (n = 42) completed all the scheduled testing protocols.&quot;</span>

The intensity of measurement and follow-up in this trial involved testing participants at three different time points: before the training program, after the training program, and after the detraining period. The full text does not provide information on the frequency or duration of the visits or any unscheduled visits triggered by primary outcome events or intervening events. However, it does mention that all subjects completed all the scheduled testing protocols, suggesting a high level of follow-up. Score: [4]

Primary outcome:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The resistance training protocol improved maximal strength and muscle power, but not muscle endurance.&quot;</span>
2. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The EG improved MVIC (P = 0.004), torque (P = 0.004) and average power (P < 0.001) after the resistance training period.&quot;</span>

The primary outcome of this trial was the effect of the resistance training program on maximal strength, muscle power, and muscle endurance. The full text provides clear results indicating that the resistance training protocol improved maximal strength and muscle power, but not muscle endurance. These outcomes are relevant to the participants and align with the primary objective of the trial. Score: [5]

Primary analysis:
1. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Data were analyzed using SPSS® 17.0 (SPSS Inc., USA). Results are presented as mean ± standard deviation (SD). Shapiro-Wilk normality test was used to assess normal data distribution.&quot;</span>
2. <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;To assess any training or detraining effect, as well as any difference between groups, MVIC, torque, average power and muscle endurance raw values were examined using two-way ANOVA with repeated measurements for group and time.&quot;</span>

The primary analysis of this trial involved analyzing the data using statistical software and conducting two-way ANOVA with repeated measurements to assess the effects of training and detraining, as well as differences between groups. The full text does not provide information on whether all available data were included in the analysis or any exclusions or restrictions in the analysis. However, the use of intention-to-treat analysis and the presentation of mean and standard deviation suggest that all available data were included. Score: [4]</pre>

The criteria do not seem to have excessive exclusions or restrictions that would make the trial highly explanatory. \n\nScore: [4]","Eligibility:\n1. 'Fifty relapsing patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) who had been on natalizumab therapy ≥24 months and were contemplating natalizumab discontinuation were enrolled.' [1]\n2. 'Inclusion criteria consisted of: a diagnosis of relapsing MS according to McDonald criteria,19 being on natalizumab therapy for 24 months or longer, aged between 18 and 65 years and an EDSS score of ≤7.0.' [1]\n3. 'Candidates were excluded from the study if active disease was identified at baseline per clinical (presence of a relapse during the previous 30 days) and/or MRI evaluation (active gadolinium (Gd)-enhancing lesions).' [1]\n\nThe eligibility criteria for this trial appear to be relatively pragmatic. The inclusion criteria are broad, including patients with relapsing MS who have been on natalizumab therapy for at least 24 months and have an EDSS score of ≤7.0. The exclusion criteria are also straightforward, excluding patients with active disease at baseline. Overall, the trial seems to enroll participants who are similar to those who would receive this intervention in usual care. Score: [4]","Eligibility:\n1.

'Recruitment of 80 eligible participants was completed in a short time frame using methods that were easy to implement and with no added costs.' [4]\n2. 'Across both sites, the most successful methods of recruitment included communication from the hockey team via e-mail or social media (e.g., Twitter) and word of mouth, where 40% and 36% of men were recruited, respectively.' [5]\n3. 'Although this study was designed as a pilot trial, we achieved many statistically and clinically important differences between groups at 12 wk, favoring the Hockey FIT group. Importantly, we engaged at-risk men, a group of individuals who are typically a hard-to-reach population, and we achieved high rates of retention, including men in the intervention group after the 40-wk minimally supported phase.' [6]\n\nThe full text provides evidence that the recruitment methods used in the trial were pragmatic and similar to those used in usual care. The recruitment was completed in a short time frame using methods that were easy to implement and with no added costs. The most successful methods of recruitment included communication from the hockey team via e-mail or social media and word of mouth. The trial also achieved high rates of retention, indicating that the recruitment efforts were successful in engaging the target population. Score: [5]\n\nSetting:\n1. 'We conducted a pilot, pragmatic randomized controlled trial (pRCT; parallel groups, stratified by site) in Ontario, Canada.' [7]\n2. 'We used a pragmatic approach for the program venue at each site, using a combination of the hockey team’s arena and an affiliated health club facility.' [8]\n3. 'In this study, most men were white, employed, and married/living common-law, and about three-quarters had education greater than high school.' [9]\n\nThe full text provides information about the setting of the trial. The trial was conducted in Ontario, Canada, which is a pragmatic choice as it reflects the usual care setting. The program venue at each site was a combination of the hockey team's arena and an affiliated health club facility, which is also pragmatic. The demographic characteristics of the participants suggest that the trial was conducted in a real-world setting. Score: [5]\n\nOrganisation:\n1. 'The Hockey FIT program was delivered over 12 weekly, 90-min sessions by Hockey FIT coaches (coach to participant ratio 2:20) from the central research team.' [10]\n2. 'Participants were encouraged to continue with their lifestyle prescriptions and sustain their behavior changes with the support of free-of-charge eHealth tools: 1) HealtheSteps smartphone app providing tools to track and sustain PA (www.healthesteps.ca) and 2) Hockey FIT social network, a secure Web-based network tailored to each site and including only group members and coaches.' [11]\n3. 'Although the trial itself may have influenced participants in the comparator group, this would only have made estimates in this study (i.e., differences between groups) more conservative.' [12]\n\nThe full text provides information about the organization of care delivery in the intervention arm of the trial. The Hockey FIT program was delivered by Hockey FIT coaches from the central research team, which suggests that additional resources and expertise were provided compared to usual care. Participants were also provided with free eHealth tools to support their behavior changes. The trial design may have influenced participants in the comparator group, but this would only make the estimates more conservative. Score: [3]\n\nFlexibility (delivery):\n1. 'The Hockey FIT program was delivered over 12 weekly, 90-min sessions by Hockey FIT coaches (coach to participant ratio 2:20) from the central research team.' [10]\n2. 'Twice throughout the program, participants completed the validated Step Test and Exercise Prescription to receive a personalized target heart rate to strive for during aerobic activities.' [13]\n3. 'Participants were encouraged to continue with their lifestyle prescriptions and sustain their behavior changes with the support of free-of-charge eHealth tools: 1) HealtheSteps smartphone app providing tools to track and sustain PA (www.healthesteps.ca) and 2) Hockey FIT social network, a secure Web-based network tailored to each site and including only group members and coaches.' [11]\n\nThe full text provides evidence that the intervention arm of the trial had some flexibility in how the intervention was delivered. The Hockey FIT program was delivered over 12 weekly, 90-minute sessions, which suggests that there was some flexibility in the timing and duration of the sessions. Participants also received personalized exercise prescriptions based on their fitness levels. The use of eHealth tools, such as the smartphone app and social network, provided additional flexibility in how participants could track and sustain their physical activity. Score: [4]\n\nFlexibility (adherence):\n1. 'Participants were encouraged to continue with their lifestyle prescriptions and sustain their behavior changes with the support of free-of-charge eHealth tools: 1) HealtheSteps smartphone app providing tools to track and sustain PA (www.healthesteps.ca) and 2) Hockey FIT social network, a secure Web-based network tailored to each site and including only group members and coaches.' [11]\n2. 'For the remaining 30 men (i.e., program completers), the mean (SD) for percentage of sessions attended was 81.7% (13.7).' [14]\n3. 'Although this study was designed as a pilot trial, we achieved many statistically and clinically important differences between groups at 12 wk, favoring the Hockey FIT group. Importantly, we engaged at-risk men, a group of individuals who are typically a hard-to-reach population, and we achieved high rates of retention, including men in the intervention group after the 40-wk minimally supported phase.' [6]\n\nThe full text provides evidence that there was some flexibility in how participants must adhere to the intervention. Participants were encouraged to continue with their lifestyle prescriptions and sustain their behavior changes using eHealth tools, which suggests that there was no strict protocol or strict monitoring of adherence. The high rates of retention and program completion also indicate that there was flexibility in adherence to the intervention. Score: [4]\n\nFollow-up:\n1. 'Follow-up occurred at 12 wk (both groups) and 12 months (intervention group only to explore the sustainability of long-term change).' [7]\n2. 'Overall, trial retention was &gt;80% at 12 wk and &gt;75% (intervention group only) at 12 months.' [6]\n3. 'By 12 months, 17% of men in the intervention group had maintained weight loss of ≥5% since baseline.' [6]\n\nThe full text provides evidence that the intensity of measurement and follow-up of participants in the trial was similar to what would be expected in usual care. Follow-up occurred at 12 weeks for both groups and at 12 months for the intervention group. The high rates of trial retention at 12 weeks and 12 months indicate that the follow-up was feasible and similar to what would be expected in usual care. Score: [5]\n\nPrimary outcome:\n1. 'At 12 wk, the intervention group lost 3.6 kg (95% confidence interval, −5.26 to −1.90 kg) more than the comparator group (P &lt; 0.001) and maintained this weight loss to 12 months.' [3]\n2. 'The intervention group also demonstrated greater improvements in other clinical measures, physical activity, diet, and self-rated health at 12 wk; most sustained to 12 months.' [3]\n3. 'Our results are provocative because we found that men who participated in the Hockey FIT program lost weight, increased their steps per day, and improved other clinical outcomes (e.g., systolic BP), their diet, and perceptions of their own health, to a greater extent compared with the controls.' [3]\n\nThe full text provides evidence that the trial's primary outcome, weight loss, was relevant to the participants. The intervention group lost significantly more weight than the comparator group at 12 weeks and maintained this weight loss to 12 months. The intervention group also demonstrated greater improvements in other clinical measures, physical activity, diet, and self-rated health. These findings suggest that the primary outcome was of obvious importance to the participants and was measured in a similar way to usual care. Score: [5]\n\nPrimary analysis:\n1.

You are an expert in clinical trial design and are tasked to assess the PRECIS-2 scores of a trial based on the full text of its publication. You have the following briefing:

# PRECIS-2 Domains
* Eligibility: To what extent are the participants in the trial similar to those who would receive this intervention if it was part of usual care? For example, score 5 for very pragmatic criteria essentially identical to those in usual care; score 1 for a very explanatory approach with lots of exclusions (e.g. those who don’t comply, respond to treatment, or are not at high risk for primary outcome, are children or elderly), or uses many selection tests not used in usual care.
* Recruitment: How much extra effort is made to recruit participants over and above what that would be used in the usual care setting to engage with patients? For example, score 5 for very pragmatic recruitment through usual appointments or clinic; score 1 for a very explanatory approach with targeted invitation letters, advertising in newspapers, radio plus incentives and other routes that would not be used in usual care.
* Setting: How different is the setting of the trial and the usual care setting? For example, score 5 for a very pragmatic choice using identical settings to usual care; score 1, for a very explanatory approach with only a single centre, or only specialised trial or academic centres.
* Organisation: How different are the resources, provider expertise and the organisation of care delivery in the intervention arm of the trial and those available in usual care? For example, score 5 for a very pragmatic choice that uses identical organisation to usual care; score 1 for a very explanatory approach if the trial increases staff levels, gives additional training, require more than usual experience or certification and increase resources.
* Flexibility (delivery): How different is the flexibility in how the intervention is delivered and the flexibility likely in usual care? For example, score 5 for a very pragmatic choice with identical flexibility to usual care; score 1 for a very explanatory approach if there is a strict protocol, monitoring and measures to improve compliance, with specific advice on allowed co-interventions and complications.
* Flexibility (adherence): How different is the flexibility in how participants must adhere to the intervention and the flexibility likely in usual care? For example, score 5 for a very pragmatic choice involving no more than usual encouragement to adhere to the intervention; score 1 for a very explanatory approach that involves exclusion based on adherence, and measures to improve adherence if found wanting. In some trials eg surgical trials where patients are being operated on or Intensive Care Unit trials where patients are being given IV drug therapy, this domain is not applicable as there is no compliance issue after consent has been given, so this score should be left blank.
* Follow-up: How different is the intensity of measurement and follow-up of participants in the trial and the likely follow-up in usual care? For example, score 5 for a very pragmatic approach with no more than usual follow up; score 1 for a very explanatory approach with more frequent, longer visits, unscheduled visits triggered by primary outcome event or intervening event, and more extensive data collection.
* Primary outcome: To what extent is the trial's primary outcome relevant to participants? For example, score 5 for a very pragmatic choice where the outcome is of obvious importance to participants; score 1 for a very explanatory approach using a surrogate, physiological outcome, central adjudication or use assessment expertise that is not available in usual care, or the outcome is measured at an earlier time than in usual care.
* Primary analysis: To what extent are all data included in the analysis of the primary outcome? For example, score 5 for a very pragmatic approach using intention to treat with all available data; score 1 for a very explanatory analysis that excludes ineligible post-randomisation participants, includes only completers or those following the treatment protocol.

For each of the 9 domains of PRECIS-2, perform the following steps:
1. Extract 1-3 relevant quotes from the full text.
2. Explain your reasoning in 1 paragraph.
3. Give a score X from 1 (very explanatory) to 5 (very pragmatic) in square brackets like this: "Score: [X]". If the full text does not contain enough information to assess a specific domain, report "Score: [NA]".

Do not provide a final summary paragraph in the end.
