P24. ""[Yes]"" - ""We identified two relevant SRs and 29 non-randomized studies. Due to the heterogeneity of the data, meta-analysis was not possible. Ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging are insufficient for identification or localization of IAT; laparoscopic or surgical exploration is necessary. Primary orchiopexy is effective for low IAT, and Fowler-Stephens orchiopexy (FSO) is effective for high IAT. There is no clear benefit of one- vs. two-stage FSO, or of open vs. laparoscopic technique. Several alternative or modified techniques also show promise. RCTs are needed to confirm the validity of these findings, and to assess long-term outcomes."" - The main findings are summarized, including the strength of evidence for each main outcome.

P26. ""[Yes]"" - ""We conducted a systematic review of literature focusing on the surgical treatment of IAT, including quality assessment of each study. From there, we were able to draw conclusions regarding the ideal treatment based on the highest quality evidence available, and propose suggestions for future research. By synthesizing the evidence and making it easily accessible to medical professionals, we can help busy clinicians determine which surgical techniques warrant integration into practice, enhancing the use of evidence-based medicine."" - A general interpretation of the results is provided in the context of other evidence, and implications for future research are discussed.

A synthesis of the relevant data is presented in a descriptive form due to the heterogeneity of the included articles. Results ["" [...] ""] Conclusion OS for RTEF has a low morbidity and mortality, a higher success rate, and requires fewer treatments than an endoscopic repair. The ideal ET is undecided but it remains a viable alternative provided treatment failures are anticipated and prompt redos initiated to prevent ongoing respiratory morbidity.""

The diagnosis of these recurrent tracheoesophageal fistulas (RTEF) can often be elusive to the unsuspecting physician and the ideal approach to their management is still in debate.

A6. ""A total of 23 papers between 1984 and 2012 described 57 patients undergoing some form of endoscopic treatment (ET) while 21 papers between 1955 and 2013 described 108 patients that underwent an open surgical repair (OS). A total of 165 cases of RTEF are described and there were 44 (26.7%) cases associated with anastomotic leaks while 35 (21.2%) were associated with anastomotic strictures preceding the diagnosis of RTEF.""
Explanation: The authors provided some characteristics of the included studies.
Response: [Yes]

A7. ""Overall, of the 57 patients managed using a variety of ETs there was an 84% (n = 48) success rate compared with 93.5% (n = 101) of 108 patients that had OS.""
Explanation: The authors assessed the scientific quality of the included studies by comparing the success rates of different treatments.
Response: [Yes]

A8. ""The results when ET were grouped into “de-epithelialization only,” “sealant only,” and “de-epithelialization combined with sealants” (as suggested by Richter et al) is summarized in Table 4. There were no significant observations except that contrary to Richter’s findings, the use of “sealants only” resulted in the most successful single treatments reported (67%) and the least number of treatments required (mean 1.5; range 1–3). This finding should however be interpreted with caution due to the small numbers, particularly in the “sealant only” group (n = 6).""

P1. ""Management of Recurrent Tracheoesophageal Fistulas: A Systematic Review""
Explanation: The title identifies the report as a systematic review.
Response: [Yes]

P2. ""Abstract [...] Introduction The management of a recurrent tracheoesophageal fistula (RTEF) includes either open surgery (OS) or an endoscopic treatment (ET); the ideal option is unclear. We aim to comparatively review all published treatment options, and outcomes, for managing RTEF. Materials and Methods A literature search was performed using the keywords “recurrent tracheoesophageal fistula.” All English language articles describing the management of RTEF in children were reviewed. A synthesis of the relevant data is presented in a descriptive form due to the heterogeneity of the included articles. Results [...] Conclusion OS for RTEF has a low morbidity and mortality, a higher success rate, and requires fewer treatments than an endoscopic repair. The ideal ET is undecided but it remains a viable alternative provided treatment failures are anticipated and prompt redos initiated to prevent ongoing respiratory morbidity.""
Explanation: The abstract includes background, objectives, data sources, study eligibility criteria, participants, interventions, study appraisal and synthesis methods, results, limitations, conclusions, and systematic review registration number.
Response: [Yes]

P3. ""The incidence of a fistula recurrence range from 1.9 to 11% after open and thoracoscopic repairs. The diagnosis of these recurrent tracheoesophageal fistulas (RTEF) can often be elusive to the unsuspecting physician and the ideal approach to their management is still in debate. Proponents of an endoscopic approach to this problem frequently state that the morbidity, mortality, and second recurrence rate are too high with an open approach and majority directly or indirectly reference Keywords: recurrent tracheoesophageal fistula, systematic review, endoscopic, management""

For evidence Level 1a, a meta-analysis (MA) of different randomized controlled trials (RCTs) is required. For evidence Level 1b, at least one RCT is required.

- Response: [Yes]

P2:
- Quote: ""Among the 922 pediatric participants included in the 10 studies, 508 had received LS and 414 OS. There were shorter length of hospital stays, less blood loss, and longer operative times with the LS approach compared with OS. However, no significant difference was found between LS and OS in the secondary outcome, such as the removal of accessory spleens or postoperative complications including postoperative high fever, ACS, and ileus.""

- Response: [Yes]

P3:
- Quote: ""Splenectomy is occasionally performed in children with various hematologic disorders such as sickle cell disease, idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, and so on [1].

Besides, total postoperative complications may be slightly lower in laparoscopic splenectomy.""
- Reasoning: The authors provided a summary of the main findings and their implications for key groups.
- Response: [Yes]

P25:
- Quote: ""Our systematic review and meta-analysis have several limitations. On one hand, there was no randomized clinical trials available in the literature for our study and the decision to perform LS or OS usually depends on preference and experiences of surgeons. Besides, some of the included studies had rather small sample size. On the other hand, obvious statistical heterogeneity was detected among different trials in terms of operative time, blood loss, and length of hospital stay.""
