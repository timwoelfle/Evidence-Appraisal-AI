A1. Was an 'a priori' design provided? 
""[Yes] The research question and inclusion criteria should be established before the conduct of the review. Note: Need to refer to a protocol, ethics approval, or pre-determined/a priori published research objectives to score a “yes.”""
Quotes: ""Our objective was to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of all published literature comparing the postoperative outcomes associated with elective surgery (while asymptomatic) versus those following surgery as part of expectant management (i.e., performing surgery only upon the development of symptoms) in children born with asymptomatic CPAM lesions.""
Reasoning: The objective and inclusion criteria were pre-specified.

A2. Was there duplicate study selection and data extraction?
""[Yes] There should be at least two independent data extractors and a consensus procedure for disagreements should be in place. Note: 2 people do study selection, 2 people do data extraction, consensus process or one person checks the other’s work.""
Quotes: ""Two independent reviewers conducted all article screening; where consensus on an article could not be reached, a third reviewer was consulted. One reviewer extracted all data from the included studies, and another checked it for accuracy and completeness.""  
Reasoning: Two reviewers independently screened studies and reached consensus. Two reviewers performed data extraction.

A3. Was a comprehensive literature search performed?
""[Yes] At least two electronic sources should be searched. The report must include years and databases used (e.g., Central, EMBASE, and MEDLINE). Key words and/or MESH terms must be stated and where feasible the search strategy should be provided. All searches should be supplemented by consulting current contents, reviews, textbooks, specialized registers, or experts in the particular field of study, and by reviewing the references in the studies found. Note: If at least 2 sources + one supplementary strategy used, select “yes” (Cochrane register/Central counts as 2 sources; a grey literature search counts as supplementary).""
Quotes: ""We conducted an electronic literature search of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (1966 onwards), EMBASE (1980 onwards), CINAHL (1982 onwards), and PubMed (1966 onwards) in January 2015."" ""Finally, we hand-searched the reference sections of all relevant articles to identify additional studies.""
Reasoning: Searched 5 databases, hand-searched references.

A4. Was the status of publication (i.e. grey literature) used as an inclusion criterion?  
""[No] The authors should state that they searched for reports regardless of their publication type. The authors should state whether or not they excluded any reports (from the systematic review), based on their publication status, language etc. Note: If review indicates that there was a search for “grey literature” or “unpublished literature,” indicate “yes.” SIGLE database, dissertations, conference proceedings, and trial registries are all considered grey for this purpose. If searching a source that contains both grey and non-grey, must specify that they were searching for grey/unpublished lit.""
Quotes: No mention of grey literature.
Reasoning: Did not search or mention grey literature. 

A5. Was a list of studies (included and excluded) provided?
""[Yes] A list of included and excluded studies should be provided. Note: Acceptable if the excluded studies are referenced. If there is an electronic link to the list but the link is dead, select “no.”""
Quotes: ""Full-text review resulted in eight of these studies being included, while an additional one was identified from hand-searching the reference sections of included articles; nine studies were ultimately included [10–12,14,23–27].""
Reasoning: Listed included studies, excluded studies referenced in flow diagram.

A6. Were the characteristics of the included studies provided?
""[Yes] In an aggregated form such as a table, data from the original studies should be provided on the participants, interventions and outcomes. The ranges of characteristics in all the studies analyzed e.g., age, race, sex, relevant socioeconomic data, disease status, duration, severity, or other diseases should be reported. Note: Acceptable if not in table format as long as they are described as above.""
Quotes: ""The MINORS scores for our included studies ranged from 7 to 14, with a median score of 9 (Table 1)."" ""Details of the complications experienced by patients in each study are provided in Table 2.""
Reasoning: Provided table with characteristics of included studies. 

A7. Was the scientific quality of the included studies assessed and documented?
""[Yes] 'A priori' methods of assessment should be provided (e.g., for effectiveness studies if the author(s) chose to include only randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled studies, or allocation concealment as inclusion criteria); for other types of studies alternative items will be relevant. Note: Can include use of a quality scoring tool or checklist, e.g., Jadad scale, risk of bias, sensitivity analysis, etc., or a description of quality items, with some kind of result for EACH study (“low” or “high” is fine, as long as it is clear which studies scored “low” and which scored “high”; a summary score/range for all studies is not acceptable).""
Quotes: ""We used the Methodological Index for Non-Randomized Studies (MINORS) to assess the quality of the included studies, as all were nonrandomized [18]."" ""The MINORS scores for our included studies ranged from 7 to 14, with a median score of 9 (Table 1).""
Reasoning: Used MINORS tool, provided quality assessment for each study.

A8. Was the scientific quality of the included studies used appropriately in formulating conclusions?
""[NA] The results of the methodological rigor and scientific quality should be considered in the analysis and the conclusions of the review, and explicitly stated in formulating recommendations. Note: Might say something such as “the results should be interpreted with caution due to poor quality of included studies.” Cannot score “yes” for this question if scored “no” for question A7.""
Quotes: No discussion of study quality in conclusions.
Reasoning: All studies were non-randomized so quality was uniformly low. No randomized trials available.

A9. Were the methods used to combine the findings of studies appropriate?
""[Yes] For the pooled results, a test should be done to ensure the studies were combinable, to assess their homogeneity (i.e., Chi-squared test for homogeneity, I2). If heterogeneity exists a random effects model should be used and/or the clinical appropriateness of combining should be taken into consideration (i.e., is it sensible to combine?). Note: Indicate “yes” if they mention or describe heterogeneity, i.e., if they explain that they cannot pool because of heterogeneity/variability between interventions.""  
Quotes: ""We produced Chi2 and I2 values to assess homogeneity."" ""using random-effects models [21]""
Reasoning: Assessed heterogeneity and used random effects model.

A10. Was the likelihood of publication bias assessed?
""[No] An assessment of publication bias should include a combination of graphical aids (e.g., funnel plot, other available tests) and/or statistical tests (e.g., Egger regression test, Hedges-Olken). Note: If no test values or funnel plot included, score “no”.""
Quotes: No assessment of publication bias.
Reasoning: Did not assess publication bias.

A11. Was the conflict of interest included?
""[No] Potential sources of support should be clearly acknowledged in both the systematic review and the included studies. Note: To get a “yes,” must indicate source of funding or support for the systematic review AND for each of the included studies.""
Quotes: No statement about conflicts of interest.
Reasoning: Did not report conflicts of interest.

P1. Identify the report as a systematic review, meta-analysis, or both. 
""[Yes] Identify the report as a systematic review, meta-analysis, or both.""
Quotes: ""Surgical versus conservative management of congenital pulmonary airway malformation in children: A systematic review and meta-analysis""

""[Yes] Provide a structured summary including, as applicable: background; objectives; data sources; study eligibility criteria, participants, and interventions; study appraisal and synthesis methods; results; limitations; conclusions and implications of key findings; systematic review registration number.""
Quotes: The abstract provides a structured summary with background, objectives, methods, results, and conclusions.
Reasoning: Structured abstract provided.

P3. Describe the rationale for the review.
""[Yes] Describe the rationale for the review in the context of what is already known."" 
Quotes: ""Arguments favoring either elective surgery or expectant management of asymptomatic lesions are many. They include estimates that delaying surgery until symptom onset will result in a more complicated procedure with worse surgical outcomes [8–13], as well as counterarguments stating that, as rates of symptom development are largely unknown [14,15], intervening before symptoms appear may result in exposure of healthy patients to unnecessary surgical risks [15]. These differing viewpoints illustrate the lack of consensus as to whether surgical management or an expectant approach for asymptomatic CPAM is associated with a smaller risk of morbidity in the short and long term.""
Reasoning: Provided background on the controversy and lack of consensus.

P4. Provide an explicit statement of questions being addressed.
""[Yes] Provide an explicit statement of questions being addressed with reference to participants, interventions, comparisons, outcomes, and study design (PICOS).""
Quotes: ""Our objective was to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of all published literature comparing the postoperative outcomes associated with elective surgery (while asymptomatic) versus those following surgery as part of expectant management (i.e., performing surgery only upon the development of symptoms) in children born with asymptomatic CPAM lesions.""
Reasoning: Clear objective statement specifying population, interventions, comparison, and outcomes. 

P5. Indicate if a review protocol exists. 
""[No] Indicate if a review protocol exists, if and where it can be accessed (e.g., Web address), and, if available, provide registration information including registration number.""
Quotes: No mention of protocol.
Reasoning: Did not mention protocol.

P6. Specify study characteristics and report characteristics. 
""[Yes] Specify study characteristics (e.g., PICOS, length of follow-up) and report characteristics (e.g., years considered, language, publication status) used as criteria for eligibility, giving rationale.""
Quotes: ""We excluded any studies on non-human subjects and those that did not focus on pediatric patients, as well as any studies that were not published in English, owing to resource limitations. We also excluded editorials, case reviews, any studies that did not evaluate postoperative outcomes, and any studies where it was not possible to extract data only on patients who were asymptomatic at birth.""
Reasoning: Specified eligibility criteria including population, outcomes, language, and publication status.

P7. Describe information sources.
""[Yes] Describe all information sources (e.g., databases with dates of coverage, contact with study authors to identify additional studies) in the search and date last searched.""
Quotes: ""We conducted an electronic literature search of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (1966 onwards), EMBASE (1980 onwards), CINAHL (1982 onwards), and PubMed (1966 onwards) in January 2015.""
Reasoning: Listed databases searched with date ranges and date last searched.

P8. Present full electronic search strategy.
""[No] Present full electronic search strategy for at least one database, including any limits used, such that it could be repeated.""
Quotes: Search strategy not provided.
Reasoning: Did not provide full search strategy.

P9. State the process for selecting studies.
""[Yes] State the process for selecting studies (i.e., screening, eligibility, included in systematic review, and, if applicable, included in the meta-analysis)."" 
Quotes: ""Two independent reviewers conducted all article screening; where consensus on an article could not be reached, a third reviewer was consulted.""
Reasoning: Described screening process.

P10. Describe method of data extraction.
""[Yes] Describe method of data extraction from reports (e.g., piloted forms, independently, in duplicate) and any processes for obtaining and confirming data from investigators.""
Quotes: ""One reviewer extracted all data from the included studies, and another checked it for accuracy and completeness.""
Reasoning: Described data extraction process.

P11. List and define all variables for which data were sought.
""[Yes] List and define all variables for which data were sought (e.g., PICOS, funding sources) and any assumptions and simplifications made.""
Quotes: ""We extracted the following data exclusively on patients who were asymptomatic at birth: number of patients undergoing elective surgery, number undergoing surgery as part of expectant management (after symptom development), age at symptom development if applicable, postoperative complications, mortalities, and total length of postoperative hospital stay, as well as number of patients successfully managed conservatively at the end of follow-up, and length of follow-up for these patients.""
Reasoning: Listed extracted variables.

P12. Describe methods for assessing risk of bias of individual studies. 
""[Yes] Describe methods used for assessing risk of bias of individual studies (including specification of whether this was done at the study or outcome level), and how this information is to be used in any data synthesis.""
Quotes: ""We used the Methodological Index for Non-Randomized Studies (MINORS) to assess the quality of the included studies, as all were nonrandomized [18].""
Reasoning: Specified MINORS used to assess quality of included studies.

Reasoning: Stated source of funding."," Here are the AMSTAR and PRISMA assessments:

A1. Was an 'a priori' design provided? 
""[Yes] The research question and inclusion criteria should be established before the conduct of the review. Note: Need to refer to a protocol, ethics approval, or pre-determined/a priori published research objectives to score a “yes.”""
Quotes: ""Our objective was to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of all published literature comparing the postoperative outcomes associated with elective surgery (while asymptomatic) versus those following surgery as part of expectant management (i.e., performing surgery only upon the development of symptoms) in children born with asymptomatic CPAM lesions.""
Reasoning: The objective and inclusion criteria were pre-specified.

A2. Was there duplicate study selection and data extraction?
""[Yes] There should be at least two independent data extractors and a consensus procedure for disagreements should be in place. Note: 2 people do study selection, 2 people do data extraction, consensus process or one person checks the other’s work.""
Quotes: ""Two independent reviewers conducted all article screening; where consensus on an article could not be reached, a third reviewer was consulted. One reviewer extracted all data from the included studies, and another checked it for accuracy and completeness.""  
Reasoning: Two reviewers independently screened studies and reached consensus. Two reviewers performed data extraction.

A3. Was a comprehensive literature search performed?
""[Yes] At least two electronic sources should be searched. The report must include years and databases used (e.g., Central, EMBASE, and MEDLINE). Key words and/or MESH terms must be stated and where feasible the search strategy should be provided. All searches should be supplemented by consulting current contents, reviews, textbooks, specialized registers, or experts in the particular field of study, and by reviewing the references in the studies found. Note: If at least 2 sources + one supplementary strategy used, select “yes” (Cochrane register/Central counts as 2 sources; a grey literature search counts as supplementary).""
Quotes: ""We conducted an electronic literature search of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (1966 onwards), EMBASE (1980 onwards), CINAHL (1982 onwards), and PubMed (1966 onwards) in January 2015."" ""Finally, we hand-searched the reference sections of all relevant articles to identify additional studies.""
Reasoning: Searched 5 databases, hand-searched references.

A4. Was the status of publication (i.e. grey literature) used as an inclusion criterion?  
""[No] The authors should state that they searched for reports regardless of their publication type. The authors should state whether or not they excluded any reports (from the systematic review), based on their publication status, language etc. Note: If review indicates that there was a search for “grey literature” or “unpublished literature,” indicate “yes.” SIGLE database, dissertations, conference proceedings, and trial registries are all considered grey for this purpose. If searching a source that contains both grey and non-grey, must specify that they were searching for grey/unpublished lit.""
Quotes: No mention of grey literature.
Reasoning: Did not search or mention grey literature. 

A5. Was a list of studies (included and excluded) provided?
""[Yes] A list of included and excluded studies should be provided. Note: Acceptable if the excluded studies are referenced. If there is an electronic link to the list but the link is dead, select “no.”""
Quotes: ""Full-text review resulted in eight of these studies being included, while an additional one was identified from hand-searching the reference sections of included articles; nine studies were ultimately included [10–12,14,23–27].""
Reasoning: Listed included studies, excluded studies referenced in flow diagram.

A6. Were the characteristics of the included studies provided?
""[Yes] In an aggregated form such as a table, data from the original studies should be provided on the participants, interventions and outcomes. The ranges of characteristics in all the studies analyzed e.g., age, race, sex, relevant socioeconomic data, disease status, duration, severity, or other diseases should be reported. Note: Acceptable if not in table format as long as they are described as above.""
Quotes: ""The MINORS scores for our included studies ranged from 7 to 14, with a median score of 9 (Table 1)."" ""Details of the complications experienced by patients in each study are provided in Table 2.""
Reasoning: Provided table with characteristics of included studies. 

A7. Was the scientific quality of the included studies assessed and documented?
""[Yes] 'A priori' methods of assessment should be provided (e.g., for effectiveness studies if the author(s) chose to include only randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled studies, or allocation concealment as inclusion criteria); for other types of studies alternative items will be relevant. Note: Can include use of a quality scoring tool or checklist, e.g., Jadad scale, risk of bias, sensitivity analysis, etc., or a description of quality items, with some kind of result for EACH study (“low” or “high” is fine, as long as it is clear which studies scored “low” and which scored “high”; a summary score/range for all studies is not acceptable).""
Quotes: ""We used the Methodological Index for Non-Randomized Studies (MINORS) to assess the quality of the included studies, as all were nonrandomized [18]."" ""The MINORS scores for our included studies ranged from 7 to 14, with a median score of 9 (Table 1).""
Reasoning: Used MINORS tool, provided quality assessment for each study.

A8. Was the scientific quality of the included studies used appropriately in formulating conclusions?
""[NA] The results of the methodological rigor and scientific quality should be considered in the analysis and the conclusions of the review, and explicitly stated in formulating recommendations. Note: Might say something such as “the results should be interpreted with caution due to poor quality of included studies.” Cannot score “yes” for this question if scored “no” for question A7.""
Quotes: No discussion of study quality in conclusions.
Reasoning: All studies were non-randomized so quality was uniformly low. No randomized trials available.

A9. Were the methods used to combine the findings of studies appropriate?
""[Yes] For the pooled results, a test should be done to ensure the studies were combinable, to assess their homogeneity (i.e., Chi-squared test for homogeneity, I2). If heterogeneity exists a random effects model should be used and/or the clinical appropriateness of combining should be taken into consideration (i.e., is it sensible to combine?). Note: Indicate “yes” if they mention or describe heterogeneity, i.e., if they explain that they cannot pool because of heterogeneity/variability between interventions.""  
Quotes: ""We produced Chi2 and I2 values to assess homogeneity."" ""using random-effects models [21]""
Reasoning: Assessed heterogeneity and used random effects model.

A10. Was the likelihood of publication bias assessed?
""[No] An assessment of publication bias should include a combination of graphical aids (e.g., funnel plot, other available tests) and/or statistical tests (e.g., Egger regression test, Hedges-Olken). Note: If no test values or funnel plot included, score “no”.""
Quotes: No assessment of publication bias.
Reasoning: Did not assess publication bias.

A11. Was the conflict of interest included?
""[No] Potential sources of support should be clearly acknowledged in both the systematic review and the included studies. Note: To get a “yes,” must indicate source of funding or support for the systematic review AND for each of the included studies.""
Quotes: No statement about conflicts of interest.
Reasoning: Did not report conflicts of interest.

P1. Identify the report as a systematic review, meta-analysis, or both. 
""[Yes] Identify the report as a systematic review, meta-analysis, or both.""

Reasoning: Structured abstract provided.

P3. Describe the rationale for the review.
""[Yes] Describe the rationale for the review in the context of what is already known."" 
Quotes: ""Arguments favoring either elective surgery or expectant management of asymptomatic lesions are many. They include estimates that delaying surgery until symptom onset will result in a more complicated procedure with worse surgical outcomes [8–13], as well as counterarguments stating that, as rates of symptom development are largely unknown [14,15], intervening before symptoms appear may result in exposure of healthy patients to unnecessary surgical risks [15]. These differing viewpoints illustrate the lack of consensus as to whether surgical management or an expectant approach for asymptomatic CPAM is associated with a smaller risk of morbidity in the short and long term.""
Reasoning: Provided background on the controversy and lack of consensus.

P4. Provide an explicit statement of questions being addressed.
""[Yes] Provide an explicit statement of questions being addressed with reference to participants, interventions, comparisons, outcomes, and study design (PICOS).""
