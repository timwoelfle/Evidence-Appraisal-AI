[Yes]

P2
Quote: ""Abstract Incidental appendectomy is the removal of the vermiform appendix accompanying another operation, without evidence of acute appendicitis. It is generally performed to eliminate the risk of future appendicitis. The risks and benefits of incidental appendectomy during various operations in children have been debated for over a century, but need to be revisited in light of innovations in medical practice, including minimally invasive surgery, improved imaging techniques, and use of the appendix as a tubular conduit for reconstruction. A comprehensive review was undertaken of the techniques, pathology, risks of appendectomy, utility of the appendix, and incidental appendectomy in the treatment of specific pediatric medical conditions. A comprehensive literature search was performed, and retrieved results were reviewed for relevance to the topic. The decision to perform a pediatric incidental appendectomy relies on informed consideration of the individual patient's co-morbid conditions, the indication for the initial operation, the future utility of the appendix, and the risk of future appendiceal pathology. The discussion includes a variety of situations and comorbid conditions that may influence a surgeon's decision to perform incidental appendectomy.""

[Yes]

P3
Quote: ""Appendectomy is the most common intra-peritoneal operation performed, and acute appendicitis represents one of the most common abdominal emergencies. Incidental appendectomy has the potential to spare a patient an additional operation—one that may carry increased risks following an initial operation, due to adhesions and distorted anatomy.""

Quote: ""Pediatric incidental appendectomy: a systematic review""  
Reasoning: The title identifies the article as a systematic review.
[Yes]

P2
Quote: ""Abstract Incidental appendectomy is the removal of the vermiform appendix accompanying another operation, without evidence of acute appendicitis. It is generally performed to eliminate the risk of future appendicitis. The risks and benefits of incidental appendectomy during various operations in children have been debated for over a century, but need to be revisited in light of innovations in medical practice, including minimally invasive surgery, improved imaging techniques, and use of the appendix as a tubular conduit for reconstruction. A comprehensive review was undertaken of the techniques, pathology, risks of appendectomy, utility of the appendix, and incidental appendectomy in the treatment of specific pediatric medical conditions. A comprehensive literature search was performed, and retrieved results were reviewed for relevance to the topic. The decision to perform a pediatric incidental appendectomy relies on informed consideration of the individual patient's co-morbid conditions, the indication for the initial operation, the future utility of the appendix, and the risk of future appendiceal pathology. The discussion includes a variety of situations and comorbid conditions that may influence a surgeon's decision to perform incidental appendectomy.""
Reasoning: The abstract provides a structured summary including background, objectives, data sources, study eligibility criteria, participants and interventions, study appraisal and synthesis methods, results, limitations, and conclusions.
[Yes]

P3
Quote: ""Appendectomy is the most common intra-peritoneal operation performed, and acute appendicitis represents one of the most common abdominal emergencies. Incidental appendectomy has the potential to spare a patient an additional operation—one that may carry increased risks following an initial operation, due to adhesions and distorted anatomy.""
Reasoning: The introduction describes the rationale for the review in the context of what is already known about appendectomy and acute appendicitis.
[Yes]

P4
Quote: ""The study aims to address the multiple questions that must be considered regarding the safe performance of pediatric IA. The goal is to suggest clinical scenarios in which IA may be beneficial, neutral, or contraindicated. The discussion includes a variety of situations and comorbid conditions that may influence a surgeon's decision to perform IA.""

""Minimally invasive adrenalectomy in children""
The title identifies the article as a review on minimally invasive adrenalectomy in children.
[Yes]

P2
""Purpose: Minimally invasive adrenalectomy (MIA) is the criterion standard for removal of small adrenal tumors in adults. The purpose of this review was to determine the place of MIA in children. Methods: The authors conducted a systematic review of the pediatric and adult literature about MIA, focusing on the technique and indications. Results: Minimally invasive adrenalectomy appears superior to open adrenalectomy for small tumors. The potential advantages of MIA are appealing for postoperative pain, risk of intestinal obstruction, and quality of scars. The most common approach is the transperitoneal lateral laparoscopy, which allows for a large working space. For small tumors or for bilateral adrenalectomy, the prone retroperitoneoscopy is a promising new technique. In children, the learning curve is an issue because the indications are rare. The most common indication is neuroblastoma without image-defined surgical risk factors. The incidence of local recurrence is low, but the follow-up is short in most cases. Conclusions: Minimally invasive adrenalectomy is promising for removal of small adrenal tumors. Long-term follow-up is required to evaluate the efficacy of MIA in neuroblastomas.

Quote: ""All 3 studies [9,10,13] reported complications during and following pyloromyotomy, 2 studies [10,13] used prophylactic antibiotics and another [9] did not use prophylactic antibiotics, so we conducted subgroup a analysis of the rate of wound infection and analysis indicated that there were no significant differences between the 2 groups (OR: 1.59, 95% CI: 0.37-6.79; OR: 2.04, 95% CI: 0.37-11.41, respectively); the outcome was consistent with the overall effect (OR: 1.77, 95% CI: 0.58-5.35) (Table 3).""
Reasoning: The authors report the results for each outcome for each study, including effect estimates and confidence intervals, but do not provide a forest plot.
[Yes]

P21 - Synthesis of results:
Quote: ""The reported total rate of complications did not differ significantly either (OR: 0.91, 95% CI: 0.54-1.53) (Table 3).""
Reasoning: The authors report the pooled results of the meta-analysis with confidence intervals and a measure of consistency (the odds ratio).

P22 - Risk of bias across studies:
No relevant quotes found.
Reasoning: The authors do not present any results of assessment of risk of bias across studies, such as publication bias or selective reporting.
[NA] - Not applicable as no assessment was mentioned.

P23 - Additional analyses:
Quote: ""For the purpose of meta-analysis, the standard deviation (SD) of continuous variables was required. This was reported in 2 studies. Another study reported median (IQR, range) values which could not be converted to mean ± SD, hence a descriptive analysis was used.""
Reasoning: The authors report performing a descriptive analysis for one outcome where data could not be pooled, but this was not a pre-specified additional analysis.
[No]

P24 - Summary of evidence:
Quote: ""Although the number of studies on which our conclusion based is small, we found that overall LP procedures were as safe and effective as OP procedures for infants undergoing pyloromyotomy.""
Reasoning: The authors provide a brief summary of the main findings.
[Yes]

P25 - Limitations:
Quote: ""An additional weakness of this review is that the trials and patients included is small, which has limited the ability to compare the relative efficacy of the treatments. In addition, financial costs were compared in 2 studies [9,10], but we failed to indicate what the cost of the procedure actually was.""
Reasoning: The authors discuss some limitations of the review, including the small number of trials and patients and lack of cost data.
[Yes]

P26 - Conclusions:
Quote: ""Overall, this systematic review has shown a similar frequency of complications for LP and OP procedures. Furthermore, it also showed a trend toward shorter times for LP. Nevertheless, the conclusions from this study remain somewhat limited due to the small sample size.""
Reasoning: The authors provide a general interpretation of the results in the context of the evidence and note the limitations.
[Yes]

P27 - Funding:

The introduction explains the rationale for the review in the context of limitations of current therapies.
[Yes]

P4. Introduction / Objectives
Quote: ""The radiologic option is a percutaneous gastrojejunostomy (GJ) [8]. This option is less invasive, requires less recovery time, and can be removed if symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux improve.""
The introduction outlines the objective of comparing GJ to fundoplication.
[Yes]

P5. Methods / Protocol and registration
A review protocol or registration number was not mentioned.
[No]

P6. Methods / Eligibility criteria
Quote: ""We included studies that compared outcomes for FG and GJ in children with neurologic impairment. We included the results from observational studies, graded the best available evidence, and focused on patient-important outcomes, including mortality, pneumonia, complications, and quality of life.""
The eligibility criteria in terms of population, interventions, comparators, and outcomes are specified.
[Yes]

P7. Methods / Information sources
Quote: ""We conducted a systematic search of Medline, Embase, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials for studies of participants with gastroesophageal reflux treated with FG or GJ. A medical librarian helped us develop queries for each database to identify studies that mentioned fundoplication and gastrojejunostomy. These concepts were expanded to include synonyms and related terms. The search syntax and nomenclature were missed due to variation in database tax and nomenclature. We also performed manual searches of relevant journals, conference proceedings [13], theses and dissertations [14–16], and other trial registries [17–20].""
The databases searched and date last searched (February 2014) are reported.
[Yes]

P8. Methods / Search
The full search strategies are not provided.
[No]

P9. Methods / Study selection
Quote: ""Title and abstract screening was completed independently and in duplicate by two of the authors (MHL, ACS). Disagreements resulted in automatic inclusion.

During the course of our review, we decided to add major complications as a critical outcome. These were defined as adverse events other than pneumonia that resulted in surgery or prolonged hospitalization.""
The outcomes for which data were sought are defined.
[Yes]

P12. Methods / Risk of bias in individual studies
Quote: ""Risk of bias for individual studies was assessed in duplicate using the methodological index for nonrandomized studies (MINORS). Differences between reviewers were resolved through consensus.""

P24. Discussion / Summary of evidence
Quotes: ""The evidence supporting the use of FG versus GJ for refractory gastroesophageal reflux in children with neurologic impairment is very low. Studies reported to date have been complicated by baseline differences between treatment groups and imprecision due to small numbers.""
""We found that the rates of mortality and pneumonia following either procedure were similar, and that most causes of death do not appear to be related to complications of treatment or ongoing gastroesophageal reflux.""
The main findings and their strength are summarized.
[Yes]

P25. Discussion / Limitations
Quote: ""The risk of major complications appears to be higher with FG, whereas the risk of minor complications appears to be higher with GJ. Neither of these trends was statistically significant and should be interpreted with caution. Heterogeneity between publications has only been assessed in studies that compared open FG with GJ.""
Limitations at the study and review level are discussed.
[Yes]

P26. Discussion / Conclusions
Quote: ""The evidence supporting the use of FG versus GJ for refractory gastroesophageal reflux in children with neurologic impairment is very low. Studies reported to date have been complicated by baseline differences between treatment groups and imprecision due to small numbers.""

A flow diagram of the study selection process with numbers at each stage is provided.
[Yes]  

P18. Results / Study characteristics
Quote: ""All 15 studies included in the analysis were case series [4–7, 14–24, 58]. No randomized controlled trials were published comparing outcomes of GTR and STR in stages 3 and 4 neuroblastoma.""
The study designs of the included studies are reported but a full table of characteristics for each study with citations is not provided.
[No]

P19. Results / Risk of bias within studies
Quote: ""The included publications were all non-randomized observational studies. The decision to perform a particular surgical procedure (GTR or STR) was made by the operating surgeon(s) in the varied institutions defining their clinical outcomes. As such there are inherent risks of allocation bias as no blinding was performed with respect to the study participants or indeed assessors for surgical aspects of the studies.""
The risk of allocation bias in the included studies is presented.
[Yes]

P20. Results / Results of individual studies
Simple summary data for each group and effect estimates with confidence intervals are not provided for each study.
[No]

P21. Results / Synthesis of results
Quotes: ""Effect of Gross Total resection (GTR) or Limited resection (STR) on 5 year overall survival in Stage 3 neuroblastoma patients. Weights are from Mantel-Haenszel random effects analysis. Odds ratios are shown with 95% confidence intervals.""

Forest plots with odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals are provided for the meta-analyses.
[Yes]

P22. Results / Risk of bias across studies
Quote: ""Funnel plots for stage 4 neuroblastoma studies showed grouping of studies at the apex of the plot suggesting that larger studies with higher patient numbers are more likely to have been included. The lack of studies gathered at the base of the plot suggests a paucity of publications of smaller sample size. The plot is not symmetrical suggesting that there is most likely to be elements of publication bias here.""
Funnel plots assessing publication bias are presented and interpreted.
[Yes]

P23. Results / Additional analysis
No additional analyses were reported.
[NA]

P24. Discussion / Summary of evidence
Quotes: ""Neuroblastoma is a challenging disease for pediatric cancer specialists and surgeons. Survival remains poor with greater than 50% of children having widespread metastatic disease at initial clinical presentation. The defining role of surgery in patients with advanced stages 3 and 4 disease has been subject to much controversy and debate.""
""By contrast, there were no marked differences in OS found for GTR vs. STR in advanced stage 4 tumors. We did however detect a statistically significant advantage in disease free survival for these patients having GTR. This advantage needs to be carefully weighed against the major complications of surgery for this patient group to recommend a defining role for GTR in stage 4 tumors.""
The main findings are summarized, including the lack of OS benefit for stage 4 disease.
[Yes]

P25. Discussion / Limitations
Quotes: ""It is well recognized that observational studies such as cohort studies, case control studies, and case series are known to be more susceptible to bias than experimental or randomized controlled trials. All the studies included in the meta-analysis, we undertook, were case series.""
""Surgical datasets and outcomes after both types of surgical resection (GTR and STR) which clearly defined outcomes after both types of surgical resection (GTR and STR) were not adequately available in the included studies we analyzed.""
Key limitations of the observational study designs and lack of clearly defined outcomes are discussed.
[Yes]  

P26. Discussion / Conclusions
Quote: ""This study shows the feasibility of ≥90% resection in high risk neuroblastoma patients. Further, ≥90% resection positively correlated with both eventfree survival and local control. These data provide support for ≥90% resection of the primary tumor in high risk patients.""
The conclusions provide a general interpretation in the context of the evidence.
[Yes]

Quotes: ""Choledochal cysts are congenital bile duct anomalies with cystic dilatation of the biliary tree and have potential for various complications. Most of the reported cases in the world come from Asia but the management in the western world. Complete resection of the extra hepatic bile duct is the accepted management of choledochal cyst [1]. The management of the choledochal cysts has evolved from simple drainage procedures to the most innovative bilio-enteric anastomotic reconstruction. Biliary reconstruction is now commonly performed by one of several techniques, including Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy (HJ), hepaticoduodenostomy (HD), and jejunal interposition hepaticoduodenostomy [2] and [3]. Debate continues regarding the optimal method of biliary reconstruction.""

[Yes]

P4. Introduction / Objectives
Quotes: ""With the increasing trend of laparoscopic surgery for choledochal cysts, HD has become more popular among laparoscopic surgeons. Apart from the technical ease of a single anastomosis, the operation has been cited to have several other advantages such as being more physiologic and allows postoperative endoscopic access to the anastomosis if a stricture or stone occurs.""

Quotes: ""Choledochal cysts are congenital bile duct anomalies with cystic dilatation of the biliary tree and have potential for various complications. Most of the reported cases in the world come from Asia but the management in the western world. Complete resection of the extra hepatic bile duct is the accepted management of choledochal cyst [1]. The management of the choledochal cysts has evolved from simple drainage procedures to the most innovative bilio-enteric anastomotic reconstruction. Biliary reconstruction is now commonly performed by one of several techniques, including Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy (HJ), hepaticoduodenostomy (HD), and jejunal interposition hepaticoduodenostomy [2] and [3].

Quote: ""In the last 50 years, many centers have accrued large series of patients with good to excellent cosmetic outcome and minimal morbidity after pectus excavatum repair with the Ravitch technique. In 1998, the Nuss procedure for pectus excavatum repair was introduced as an alternative to the standard open repair.

P3. Introduction / Rationale
Quote: ""A CUTE APPENDICITIS IS A VERY COMMON pathology encountered in both pediatric and adult patient populations, with a lifetime risk of 7%–8%.1 There has been much recent research and debate over the best operative modality for an appendicectomy in a pediatric patient, despite the laparoscopic approach gaining popularity among pediatric surgeons.2 A recent Cochrane systematic review, which included both adult and pediatric studies, concluded that there was an increased incidence of intraabdominal abscess (IAA) following laparoscopic appendicectomy (LA) compared with the open approach (OA); the odds ratio (OR) was 2.48 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.45–4.21).3 There have only been a few reviews on this topic in a pediatric population and fewer that have specifically focused on the incidence of postoperative complications such as IAA, wound infection (WI), and also small bowel obstruction (SBO).4–6 A recently conducted retrospective review in a large multicenter study led by our group revealed an increased incidence of IAA formation following LA compared with the open approach (OA). As the majority of these analyses have focused on appendicectomy in adults, our aim was to review the evidence base for pediatric patients.""

P3. Introduction / Rationale
Quote: ""A CUTE APPENDICITIS IS A VERY COMMON pathology encountered in both pediatric and adult patient populations, with a lifetime risk of 7%–8%.1 There has been much recent research and debate over the best operative modality for an appendicectomy in a pediatric patient, despite the laparoscopic approach gaining popularity among pediatric surgeons.2 A recent Cochrane systematic review, which included both adult and pediatric studies, concluded that there was an increased incidence of intraabdominal abscess (IAA) following laparoscopic appendicectomy (LA) compared with the open approach (OA); the odds ratio (OR) was 2.48 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.45–4.21).3 There have only been a few reviews on this topic in a pediatric population and fewer that have specifically focused on the incidence of postoperative complications such as IAA, wound infection (WI), and also small bowel obstruction (SBO).4–6 A recently conducted retrospective review in a large multicenter study led by our group revealed an increased incidence of IAA formation following LA compared with the open approach (OA). As the majority of these analyses have focused on appendicectomy in adults, our aim was to review the evidence base for pediatric patients.""

P24. Discussion / Summary of evidence
Quotes: ""This meta-analysis shows the lowest complication rates for the TIP repair when it is applied to primary distal hypospadias, with mean rates of meatal stenosis at 3.6% (range 1.7-7.4%), urethral stricture at 1.3% (range 0.8-2.2%), fistula at 5.7% (range 4.0-8.2%) and re-operation at 4.5% (range 2.7-7.5%). The fistula rate is higher than the reoperation rate as one paper reports spontaneous healing of three fistulae [24]. Several studies, including the review paper by Wilkinson et al. [66] reported a lower fistula rate but similar meatal stenosis rates, and Snodgrass reported a 2% fistula rate for the distal repairs [67]. It should be noted that the mode of evaluating complications varied between papers, with no standardised method of assessment. Performing a meta-analysis of the published data has given a pooled estimate of the complication rates assessed, by encompassing all the documented results showing that the TIP repair is a transferable technique that provides good outcomes in primary distal hypospadias.""
Reasoning: The main findings are summarized, including the complication rates for primary distal repairs and the limitations of the evidence.
[Yes]

P25. Discussion / Limitations
Quotes: ""It should be noted that the mode of evaluating complications varied between papers, with no standardised method of assessment. Performing a meta-analysis of the published data has given a pooled estimate of the complication rates assessed, by encompassing all the documented results showing that the TIP repair is a transferable technique that provides good outcomes in primary distal hypospadias. In primary proximal repairs, there are higher complication rates for all variables, with fistula and re-operation rates over 10%. Very poor documentation of pre-operative meatal location and postoperative chordee precluded assessment of this for the primary proximal repairs, even though this is likely to be a significant outcome measure. In the United Kingdom, in order to decrease the chance of complications many surgeons would opt to perform a staged repair for this degree of hypospadias.""
Reasoning: Several limitations are discussed at the study level (lack of standardized outcome assessment) and review level (poor documentation precluding some analyses).
[Yes]

P26. Discussion / Conclusions
Quotes: ""Experience so far with the TIP repair has shown that modifications have reduced the complications. The wide reporting of modifications suggests that surgeons have found that the initial technique was in need of changing. Lack of standardised outcome measure reporting has significantly reduced the available papers for the present study, which limited the power of the analysis. It is suggested that outcome measures become established as criteria for acceptance for publication. The minimum inclusion criteria of operative characteristics should be: meatal location; degree of chordee and repair technique; and postoperative outcomes, including meatal stenosis, urethral stricture, fistula, re-operation rate, residual chordee and length of follow-up (ideally greater than 24 months). In addition, standardised methods for assessment of complications should be introduced.""

[Yes]

P25. Discussion / Limitations
Quotes: ""The most well-known study evaluating iNO use in CDH comes from the Neonatal Inhaled Nitric Oxide Study Group (NINOS) group [27]. This multicenter, randomized controlled trial evaluated the use of iNO in 53 CDH infants compared to iNO use in 16 patients with a larger study evaluating iNO use in term or near-term non-CDH infants [30]. All patients were >34 weeks gestational age, did not have congenital heart disease and had an oxygenation index (OI) >25. The authors hypothesized that the use of iNO would reduce the risk of death by day 120 or need for ECMO, or the need for supplemental oxygen at 30 days. Pre-iNO treatment with sedation, analgesia, neuromuscular blockade, alkalinization, and inotropic support was not standardized. Fifty-one infants had an echocardiogram performed before or during iNO. iNO was initiated at only 76% demonstrated evidence of pulmonary hypertension. iNO was initiated at 20 PPM but could be increased to 80 PPM if there was no response. The data is summarized in Table 7. (See Tables 3–6.) Two reviews of the Extracorporeal Life Support Organization Registry (ELSO) from 1990–1999 and 1991–2006, respectively, attempted to determine the optimal mode of ECMO in CDH [59,60]. Both studies identified VA as the predominant mode of registry centers (82% vs. 18% VV). Guner et al. [56] noted that while survival was 50% with VV compared to 46% in VA, after controlling for birth weight, APGAR score, gestational age, prenatal diagnosis, and other markers of severity available in the registry, survival between groups was equivalent [59]. The authors noted that VA ECMO was more likely to be associated with neurologic complications (seizures, intracranial bleed), while renal dysfunction was more common with VV ECMO, which was similar to the findings reported by Dimmitt et al. [60].""
Reasoning: Limitations of key studies are discussed in detail.
[Yes]

P26. Discussion / Conclusions
Quotes: ""This systematic review by the APSA Outcomes and Evidence-Based Practice Committee attempted to delineate best-evidence recommendations for specific aspects of CDH care. Disappointingly, the quantity of high-level evidence was severely lacking, which precludes the identification of definitive best practices. Moreover, even when fair levels of evidence were available, certain practice patterns continue despite evidence showing no benefit (i.e. use of iNO). Variability in institutional practice patterns for CDH will likely pose a significant barrier to any further improvement in CDH outcomes. Thus, it is imperative that we dedicate efforts to design high quality studies that will inform the development of best practices for these infants. As a start, multi-institutional prospective observational trials would be beneficial in collecting updated information on outcomes and current practices. Randomized trials would help to better understand the optimal mode of ventilation (CMV vs. HFOV), use of iNO, and type of ECMO (VV vs VA). The randomization would likely require an element of risk stratification as well.""

Quotes: ""Larger defects of the diaphragm in patients with CDH have been associated with more severe clinical manifestations than in pulmonary hypoplasia and pulmonary hypertension [1]. In the past, many children with large defects died, but over the past decades, as medical management has improved, the number of patients surviving to repair has increased. Hence, it becomes imperative to learn what are the best options for diaphragm replacement when such defects are approached.""
Reasoning: The main findings are summarized, though the strength of evidence is not explicitly stated.
[Yes]

P25. Discussion / Limitations
Quotes: ""Retrospective studies are particularly susceptible to bias, especially patient selection. For example, numbers of exclusions are frequently unclear, intervention and outcome assessment are often not conducted according to standardized protocols, and outcomes may not be assessed blind.""
Reasoning: Some limitations of the review are discussed.
[Yes]

P26. Discussion / Conclusions
Quotes: ""In summary, we found no difference in complication rates between SIS and PTFE patch repairs for patients with CDH. Both patch materials resulted in a similarly high incidence and pattern of CDH recurrence and risk of SBO. Clearly, at this stage, there is no ideal patch for CDH repair. It is possible that development of new absorbable materials, which become replaced with scar tissue more quickly, or further development of composite patches will improve the recurrence risk for patch repair of CDH.""
Reasoning: The conclusions provide a general interpretation and implications for future research.
[Yes]

Firstly, Kunz and colleagues only included reviews that compared staged closure with primary fascial closure. Any other closure technique such as immediate bedside reduction followed by 'sutureless' or 'plastic' closure was not included in their review. Secondly, they grouped infants treated with a PFS together with infants treated with a traditional hand-sewn silo.

Quotes: ""This meta-analysis has some limitations that should be taken into account when considering the results. First, there are no randomized trials comparing the two procedures. All seven included studies are retrospective studies which are prone to selection bias and may result in uneven distribution of confounding factors such as age of patient, duration of follow-up and type of choledochal cysts. Second, except one study [14], the others did not compare outcomes between the laparoscopic and open group within the same study period, the main drawback in outcome conclusions from different study period is that factors other than the surgical approach, such as changes in perioperative practices or improved equipment, may introduce bias. Third, in some studies, the number of patients was too small, leading to low-power analyses. Caution should be given in the interpretation and generalization of this meta-analysis as the included study numbers are not high and also the overall quantity of these studies is insufficient.

""This meta-analysis quantitatively assessed the importance of screening for IRA and of a prophylactic Ladd procedure in the management of asymptomatic heterotaxy. It was not possible to define the overall incidence of IRA in heterotaxy because only 2 small series performed screening in all their patients. Screening in asymptomatic cases has a high positive detection rate of IRA (58%). The risk of developing acute midgut volvulus, requiring an emergency laparotomy in patients not screened for IRA, was 5.8%. An emergency Ladd procedure was associated with a 3-fold increased risk of death and almost double the risk of postoperative complications compared with an elective operation.""
The discussion summarizes the main findings including the strength of evidence for key outcomes.
[Yes]

P25
""This study could not establish a reliable overall incidence of IRA in heterotaxy because of a small number of patients in the studies that performed a screening for all their patients. Without the benefit of this information, it is impossible to determine the absolute risk of volvulus. This makes it difficult for clinicians to balance the risk-benefits and health care costs of IRA screening and treatment. We therefore urge future studies to ascertain these data in prospective large cohort screening studies by using a standardized definition of IRA. It is necessary to investigate every asymptomatic stable infant with heterotaxy for IRA, whenever clinical stability allows, to establish the true incidence of IRA in this cohort.""

""This meta-analysis quantitatively assessed the importance of screening for IRA and of a prophylactic Ladd procedure in the management of asymptomatic heterotaxy. It was not possible to define the overall incidence of IRA in heterotaxy because only 2 small series performed screening in all their patients. Screening in asymptomatic cases has a high positive detection rate of IRA (58%). The risk of developing acute midgut volvulus, requiring an emergency laparotomy in patients not screened for IRA, was 5.8%. An emergency Ladd procedure was associated with a 3-fold increased risk of death and almost double the risk of postoperative complications compared with an elective operation.""
The discussion summarizes the main findings including the strength of evidence for key outcomes.
[Yes]

P25
""This study could not establish a reliable overall incidence of IRA in heterotaxy because of a small number of patients in the studies that performed a screening for all their patients. Without the benefit of this information, it is impossible to determine the absolute risk of volvulus. This makes it difficult for clinicians to balance the risk-benefits and health care costs of IRA screening and treatment. We therefore urge future studies to ascertain these data in prospective large cohort screening studies by using a standardized definition of IRA. It is necessary to investigate every asymptomatic stable infant with heterotaxy for IRA, whenever clinical stability allows, to establish the true incidence of IRA in this cohort.""

Thus, one of the goals of future research efforts should be to determine which children can safely undergo NSS. In a recent abstract, Ehrlich et al. reported on 39 patients with unilateral WT who underwent NSS. The authors found that 9/39 (23%) were found to have positive margins or intraoperative tumor spill; these patients thus would have received additional chemotherapy and radiation owing to surgical factors. Despite this, the 5-year overall survival in those patients was 96%. Although this study has not yet only been reported in abstract form, the presented data seems to imply that at least some of these tumors may not have been appropriate candidates for NSS.""

The rest of the studies that we identified were non-randomized designs. The results of our systematic review should, therefore, be interpreted with caution.""
Reasoning: The main findings are summarized.
[Yes]

P25. Discussion / Limitations
Quotes: ""This is a fairly comprehensive systematic review, as our search included four major databases; however, it is possible that we missed some evidence by limiting our review to English language, published literature. It should also be noted that most of the evidence that we identified came from non-randomized studies—a design that inherently possesses several sources of potential bias, particularly related to the selection of study participants and the reporting of results [19, 67–69]""
Reasoning: Limitations at the study and review level are discussed.
[Yes]

P26. Discussion / Conclusions
Quotes: ""There is a paucity of good-quality evidence on this topic; however, we cautiously recommend the following: location and diagnosis of IAT should be conducted via laparoscopy, followed by inguinal canal exploration if necessary; low IAT should be corrected by primary orchiopexy, while high IAT should be corrected by either one- or two-stage FSO, according to the surgeon's preference; the decision to perform an open or laparoscopic procedure should also be based on the surgeon's preference. Further studies—particularly RCTs—are needed to confirm the validity of these recommendations, and to improve the current surgical techniques for optimization of long-term outcomes.""

Reasoning: Some characteristics of the included studies are provided in the text and tables.
[Yes]

A7. Was the scientific quality of the included studies assessed and documented?
Quotes: ""We summarized the results of our quality assessment into consideration.""
Reasoning: The authors assessed study quality using AMSTAR for SRs and other tools for non-randomized studies.
[Yes]

A8. Was the scientific quality of the included studies used appropriately in formulating conclusions?
Quotes: ""The results from seven non-randomized studies indicated that one- or two-stage FSO is successful for high IAT, while primary orchiopexy can effectively correct low IAT [43–49], with very low complication rates for both procedures [43, 45, 46]. Higher rates of success were reported for primary orchiopexy (85–100 %) compared to FSO (63–96 %) [46–50], but this is likely because primary orchiopexy is usually performed to repair low IAT, which are easier to correct than high IAT.""

""Short bowel syndrome (SBS) is generally defined as a disorder in which the patient's resorptive capacity of the intestine function is not sufficient to provide an adequate alimentary supply. The incidence of SBS varies between 2 and 5/Million [1, 2]. Currently, there are no strict criteria with which to define SBS. SBS is caused mostly by extensive resection of the small bowel, which can occur for a number of different reasons [1, 3].

""In conclusion, the treatment of SBS patients remains very complex. A combination of different approaches may add up the risks and issues of each procedure rather than combine the possible benefits. Because of that, combining different approaches should be avoided. Of course, the optimal concept should be prevention of SBS, which means to detect, to transfer, and treat patients at risk in centers of perinatal care and pediatric surgery. If failure occurs, all attempts should be made towards optimizing the function of the native bowel. This can be achieved by cooperation of pediatric surgeons and gastroenterologists. Bowel lengthening procedures should only be performed in transplant centers, or if close cooperation with them exists if lengthening fails. It is eminent to find the best therapeutic option for each patient and to individualize and modify the different possible types of applied techniques frequently.""

""Short bowel syndrome (SBS) is generally defined as a disorder in which the patient's resorptive capacity of the intestine function is not sufficient to provide an adequate alimentary supply. The incidence of SBS varies between 2 and 5/Million [1, 2]. Currently, there are no strict criteria with which to define SBS. SBS is caused mostly by extensive resection of the small bowel, which can occur for a number of different reasons [1, 3]. The most common diseases that cause SBS in children are bowel atresia, necrotizing enterocolitis, and gastroschisis [3–5].""

""In conclusion, the treatment of SBS patients remains very complex. A combination of different approaches may add up the risks and issues of each procedure rather than combine the possible benefits. Because of that, combining different approaches should be avoided. Of course, the optimal concept should be prevention of SBS, which means to detect, to transfer, and treat patients at risk in centers of perinatal care and pediatric surgery. If failure occurs, all attempts should be made towards optimizing the function of the native bowel. This can be achieved by cooperation of pediatric surgeons and gastroenterologists. Bowel lengthening procedures should only be performed in transplant centers, or if close cooperation with them exists if lengthening fails. It is eminent to find the best therapeutic option for each patient and to individualize and modify the different possible types of applied techniques frequently.""

Quotes: ""Purpose: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to summarize the effect of preoperative hormonal stimulation on complication rates following proximal hypospadias repair. Materials and Methods: We comprehensively searched the published and unpublished literature between 1990 and 2010. Eligibility criteria were applied. Title, abstract and full text screening was carried out by 2 independent authors, and discrepancies were resolved by consensus. Heterogeneity between studies was tested using Cochran chi-square Q test and quantified by calculating I2. Quality appraisal of included studies was performed. Meta-analysis was conducted as a surrogate measure using a random effects model. Results: Our search yielded 288 citations, of which 11 (622 patients) met inclusion criteria and were incorporated into the systematic review. Most series were retrospective observational studies of moderate or low methodological quality. The patients were stratified by PHS administration of preoperative hormonal stimulation, with intramuscular testosterone being the most commonly prescribed formulation. Four studies addressed postoperative complication rates stratified by preoperative hormonal stimulation use and were included in a meta-analysis. The odds ratio for a complication occurring with preoperative hormonal stimulation use was 1.67 (CI 0.96–2.91, p = 0.07, I2 = 0%). No persistent side effects due to preoperative hormonal stimulation were reported. Conclusions: To our knowledge this is the only systematic review and meta-analysis thus far that has critically assessed the effect of preoperative hormonal stimulation on operative outcomes after hypospadias repair. The published literature is of low quality and lacks standardized reporting of important patient and surgical details. The effect of preoperative hormonal stimulation on operative outcomes after hypospadias repair remains unclear and requires further investigation.""

One series (reference 18 in article) was a cohort nonrandomized study of 126 patients, of whom 30 received PHS and had a higher complication rate. It can be argued that the PHS group had more severe deformities and, therefore, the higher complication rate.""

[Yes]

P26
Quote: ""To improve our understanding of the influence of PHS on operative outcomes following hypospadias surgery, we suggest that certain criteria be met in future studies. Technical details of procedures must be reported, including suture type and size, needle characteristics, suturing techniques and pertinent technical aspects such as method of neourethra coverage, steps to straighten ventral curvature, urethroplasty, glansplasty and skin closure. Patients need to be stratified according to severity of hypospadias. Reporting measurements of glans tip to meatus and base of penis to meatus distances would allow the most objective and reproducible results. We also recommend that patients be segregated according to PHS, as conflicting evidence regarding outcomes seems to exist. Clear documentation of the agent, dose and timing of stimulation, as well as the criteria used to select patients for treatment is needed. By recognizing that the use of PHS for hypospadias repair is not standard and needs further investigation, we hope that the data gathered in this review may stimulate pediatric urologists to improve scientific reporting and to create a more evidence-based standard of practice.""

Reasoning: The title identifies the article as a systematic review.
[Yes]

P2
Quotes: ""Purpose: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to summarize the effect of preoperative hormonal stimulation on complication rates following proximal hypospadias repair. Materials and Methods: We comprehensively searched the published and unpublished literature between 1990 and 2010. Eligibility criteria were applied. Title, abstract and full text screening was carried out by 2 independent authors, and discrepancies were resolved by consensus. Heterogeneity between studies was tested using Cochran chi-square Q test and quantified by calculating I2. Quality appraisal of included studies was performed. Meta-analysis was conducted as a surrogate measure using a random effects model. Results: Our search yielded 288 citations, of which 11 (622 patients) met inclusion criteria and were incorporated into the systematic review. Most series were retrospective observational studies of moderate or low methodological quality. The patients were stratified by PHS administration of preoperative hormonal stimulation, with intramuscular testosterone being the most commonly prescribed formulation. Four studies addressed postoperative complication rates stratified by preoperative hormonal stimulation use and were included in a meta-analysis. The odds ratio for a complication occurring with preoperative hormonal stimulation use was 1.67 (CI 0.96–2.91, p = 0.07, I2 = 0%). No persistent side effects due to preoperative hormonal stimulation were reported. Conclusions: To our knowledge this is the only systematic review and meta-analysis thus far that has critically assessed the effect of preoperative hormonal stimulation on operative outcomes after hypospadias repair. The published literature is of low quality and lacks standardized reporting of important patient and surgical details. The effect of preoperative hormonal stimulation on operative outcomes after hypospadias repair remains unclear and requires further investigation.""

[Yes]

P3
Quote: ""Surgical correction of hypospadias is a technically demanding procedure with well-defined complications, including glans dehiscence, urethrocutaneous fistula, meatal stenosis and unsatisfactory cosmesis due to scarring.

Reasoning: The discussion summarizes the main findings, including the strength of evidence and relevance to key stakeholders.
[Yes]

P25
Quote: ""The primary outcome of our systematic review was complication rate in the context of PHS therapy. The primary limitation to our systematic review and meta-analysis was the limited number of studies addressing this question. Of the 11 articles used only 2 were considered high quality by the authors. One series (reference 18 in article) was a cohort nonrandomized study of 126 patients, of whom 30 received PHS and had a higher complication rate. It can be argued that the PHS group had more severe deformities and, therefore, the higher complication rate.""
Reasoning: The discussion addresses limitations at the study level (low quality evidence) and review level (limited number of studies).
[Yes]

P26
Quote: ""To improve our understanding of the influence of PHS on operative outcomes following hypospadias surgery, we suggest that certain criteria be met in future studies. Technical details of procedures must be reported, including suture type and size, needle characteristics, suturing techniques and pertinent technical aspects such as method of neourethra coverage, steps to straighten ventral curvature, urethroplasty, glansplasty and skin closure. Patients need to be stratified according to severity of hypospadias. Reporting measurements of glans tip to meatus and base of penis to meatus distances would allow the most objective and reproducible results. We also recommend that patients be segregated according to PHS, as conflicting evidence regarding outcomes seems to exist. Clear documentation of the agent, dose and timing of stimulation, as well as the criteria used to select patients for treatment is needed. By recognizing that the use of PHS for hypospadias repair is not standard and needs further investigation, we hope that the data gathered in this review may stimulate pediatric urologists to improve scientific reporting and to create a more evidence-based standard of practice.""

However, it is generally believed that the small size of the baby and anesthesiologic considerations favor OH in premature babies with inguinal hernias [26]. Thus, we believe that studies with larger number of patients and long-term follow-up, especially RCTs, are needed to further strengthen these findings.""
Reasoning: General conclusions are provided in the context of the evidence and future research implications are suggested.

[Yes]

P25. Discussion / Limitations
Quote: ""While a previous investigation demonstrated no difference in surgical site infections (SSI) when comparing GS closures performed in the operating room versus the neonatal intensive care unit, concerns remain about the potential to increase infections at the site of closure if not performed under optimal conditions in the OR [30].""
Reasoning: Some limitations at the study and review level are discussed.
[Yes]

P26. Discussion / Conclusions
Quote: ""Available evidence justifies the increasing use of flap closure as a method to close the abdominal defect in patients with GS. It results in comparable short-term outcomes when compared to fascial closure, and obviates the need for general anesthesia in some cases. It also appears to reduce the rate of surgical site infections, and while the incidence of umbilical hernias is unsurprisingly higher, these may not need operative correction. The results of this review are limited by the quality of included studies and further prospective evidence is needed to clarify the role of flap closure for patients with gastroschisis.""
Reasoning: The conclusions provide a general interpretation of the results in the context of other evidence and note implications for future research.
[Yes]

Intervention: Sutureless flap closure either primarily or after silo reduction, in simple and complex GS cases. Control: Operative fascial closure under general anesthesia either primarily or after a silo, in simple and complex GS cases. Outcomes: The primary outcome was mortality rate. Secondary outcomes included the length of hospital stay, the number of post-intervention days on mechanical ventilation, the number of post-intervention days on total parenteral nutrition (TPN), the number of NEC or SIP, LOS days (NPO), the incidence of surgical site infection, the incidence of umbilical hernia, the need for umbilical hernia repair, and markers of resource utilization.""

Reasoning: The results of subgroup analyses based on study characteristics are reported.
[Yes]

P24. Discussion / Summary of evidence
Quote: ""While the sutured fascial technique has been the classical method of abdominal defect closure in patients with GS, the flap ""sutureless"" closure has been increasingly adopted as a viable alternative by a growing number of surgeons for both simple and complex GS [4,8,10]. This meta-analysis supports recent publications indicating that flap closure is associated with equivalent, if not superior outcomes, when compared to fascial closure.""
Reasoning: The main findings are summarized, including their strength and relevance to key stakeholders.
[Yes]

P25. Discussion / Limitations
Quote: ""While a previous investigation demonstrated no difference in surgical site infections (SSI) when comparing GS closures performed in the operating room versus the neonatal intensive care unit, concerns remain about the potential to increase infections at the site of closure if not performed under optimal conditions in the OR [30].""
Reasoning: Some limitations at the study and review level are discussed.
[Yes]

P26. Discussion / Conclusions
Quote: ""Available evidence justifies the increasing use of flap closure as a method to close the abdominal defect in patients with GS. It results in comparable short-term outcomes when compared to fascial closure, and obviates the need for general anesthesia in some cases. It also appears to reduce the rate of surgical site infections, and while the incidence of umbilical hernias is unsurprisingly higher, these may not need operative correction. The results of this review are limited by the quality of included studies and further prospective evidence is needed to clarify the role of flap closure for patients with gastroschisis.""
Reasoning: The conclusions provide a general interpretation of the results in the context of other evidence and note implications for future research.
[Yes]

The aim of this review was to evaluate worldwide experiences with LAARP with regard to indications, outcomes, and quality of reporting.
Method: A systematic review was conducted. The search was limited to studies reported in English and performed in addition to Medline and PubMed, a manual search of the Journal of Pediatric Surgery, Pediatric Surgery International, Surgical Endoscopy, and the Journal of Laparoendoscopic & Advanced Surgical Techniques published between June 2000 and April 2008 was conducted.
Results: Seventeen studies were included in the final analysis. Of the included studies, none were randomized, 2 were prospective in nature, and 4 compared outcomes of posterior sagittal anorectoplasty and LAARP. The studies included 124 patients (96 males, 28 females) with 80% reported as having high/intermediate malformations. All studies reported short-term outcomes. Reported outcomes included continence, rectal prolapse, the position of the rectum (7 studies using Kelly score), manometry (1 study), contrast enema (1 study), postural endosonography (3 studies), and postoperative complications (3 studies). Outcomes varied widely between reports precluding a meta-analysis.
Conclusion: The number of studies dealing with LAARP is low. There is a need for both a standardization and improvement in the quality of reporting in LAARP research. This will ultimately allow for evidence-based surgical decision making.""

Quote: ""Laparoscopic-assisted anorectal pull-through for anorectal malformations: a systematic review and the need for standardization of outcome reporting""
Reasoning: The title identifies the article as a systematic review.
[Yes]  

P2
Quote: ""Introduction: Laparoscopic-assisted anorectal pull-through (LAARP) is becoming an increasingly common procedure to correct high and intermediate anorectal malformations (ARMs). The aim of this review was to evaluate worldwide experiences with LAARP with regard to indications, outcomes, and quality of reporting.
Method: A systematic review was conducted. The search was limited to studies reported in English and performed in addition to Medline and PubMed, a manual search of the Journal of Pediatric Surgery, Pediatric Surgery International, Surgical Endoscopy, and the Journal of Laparoendoscopic & Advanced Surgical Techniques published between June 2000 and April 2008 was conducted.
Results: Seventeen studies were included in the final analysis. Of the included studies, none were randomized, 2 were prospective in nature, and 4 compared outcomes of posterior sagittal anorectoplasty and LAARP. The studies included 124 patients (96 males, 28 females) with 80% reported as having high/intermediate malformations. All studies reported short-term outcomes. Reported outcomes included continence, rectal prolapse, the position of the rectum (7 studies using Kelly score), manometry (1 study), contrast enema (1 study), postural endosonography (3 studies), and postoperative complications (3 studies). Outcomes varied widely between reports precluding a meta-analysis.
Conclusion: The number of studies dealing with LAARP is low. There is a need for both a standardization and improvement in the quality of reporting in LAARP research. This will ultimately allow for evidence-based surgical decision making.""

Quotes: ""Data were synthesized using standard methods as described in the Cochrane Reviewers Handbook [8]. The chi-squared test for heterogeneity was used to assess the extent to which the results of the studies were in agreement. Using a conservative cut-off of p<0.01, no statistical heterogeneity was detected and therefore fixed-effect methods were used throughout. Dichotomous outcomes were meta-analysed using Mantel–Haenszel fixed effects methods to produce summary odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals. Continuous variables were meta-analysed using the inverse-variance fixed-effect method to produce weighted mean differences and 95% confidence intervals.

P3
Quotes: ""With variation existing around the specifics of management of some of the most common neonatal surgical conditions including oesophageal atresia, gastroschisis and Hirschsprung's disease, research should be commonplace. Yet despite these fertile conditions for research, for these three conditions, only fourteen prospectively registered clinical trials and two systematic reviews could be identified on a search of the major registries at the time of writing (Table 1). Whilst both the low incidence of many of the studied conditions, and the difficulties in gaining ethical approval are at least in part responsible for the lack of paediatric surgical research, we do not believe that they account for the whole story.""

[Yes]

P25
Quotes: ""As is representative of most research in paediatric surgery [14], our meta-analysis was limited by the fact that the majority of studies available for inclusion were small, retrospective case series or cohort studies. Due to the impact of chance and confounding on the results of these studies, it is impossible to generate robust guidelines based upon them. To produce evidence-based guidelines, the type of study used for assessment of any given intervention should progress as described by the IDEAL recommendations [15] through the use of large cohort studies, to the gold standard randomised controlled trial. Doing so not only increases the weight of the conclusions of the primary research, but also of any meta-analysis including them.""
Reasoning: The authors discuss several limitations of the review, including the small size and retrospective nature of the included studies, the potential for chance and confounding to impact the results, and the inability to generate robust guidelines based on these studies alone.

Quotes: ""With variation existing around the specifics of management of some of the most common neonatal surgical conditions including oesophageal atresia, gastroschisis and Hirschsprung's disease, research should be commonplace. Yet despite these fertile conditions for research, for these three conditions, only fourteen prospectively registered clinical trials and two systematic reviews could be identified on a search of the major registries at the time of writing (Table 1). Whilst both the low incidence of many of the studied conditions, and the difficulties in gaining ethical approval are at least in part responsible for the lack of paediatric surgical research, we do not believe that they account for the whole story.""

P26. Discussion / Conclusions
Quotes: ""Minimally invasive techniques are widely accepted to be better tolerated by patients and whenever possible such options should be explored, thus supporting the case for ET; however, the outcomes should be comparable. Several authors have used a variety of techniques for ET, summarized above, all hoping to achieve better outcomes. There have been three literature reviews on ET. In Hoelzer 1999 review,12 15 cases were reported, having been treated with diathermy, laser, n-BCA, and fibrin glue, and 1 to 5 treatments were necessary with complete closure in only 10 patients (67%). Meier et al in 200726 reported an overall success rate of 60% of 62 patients culled from the literature (fibrin glue 55% [n = 22], n-BCA 48% [n = 29], laser 80% [n = 5], diathermy 50% [n = 10], n-BCA + sealant100% [n = 5]); the mean number of applications ranged from 1 to 5.5. They concluded that ET is safe, effective, has less morbidity than OS and recommended fibrin glue but advised close follow-up. Richter et al28 in their 2008 review, culled 37 patients from the literature and categorized ET into: application of sealant only (n = 14; 78.6% success), de-epithelization of the fistula tract only (n = 8; 62.5% success), de-epithelization combined with sealant (n = 15; 93.3%). Overall there was an 81.1% success rate (48.6% after a single attempt) and they concluded that de-epithelization with diathermy combined with fibrin glue sealant will yield the best results; fibrin glue by nature would work better if the opening is small, as it is opposed and not stretched.""

Reasoning: The main findings are summarized.
[Yes]

P25. Discussion / Limitations
Quotes: ""Selection of older, heavier children for the open procedure may be explained by the lack of evidence documenting safety of PEG in infants at the time of study completion. The first large pediatric review of PEG in small (<6 kg) neonates with failure to thrive was in 2011 [38]. As there is currently no literature supporting patient age or weight as a predictive factor for success and safety of tube placement, we are unable to draw conclusions on the influence of these discrepancies of baseline demographics on the results.""
Reasoning: Limitations at the study and review level are discussed.
[Yes]

P26. Discussion / Conclusions
Quotes: ""The most commonly reported disadvantages of LAP over PEG are increased operative length and cost. Three of the 10 comparative studies commented on operative length, 2 of which reported a statistically significant decrease in operative time in the PEG group compared to LAP. However, Zamakhshary et al. [11] reported cumulative operative time (for the PEG group including conversion to low-profile button under general anesthesia) and reported no significant difference in operative length between the two techniques when this conversion was accounted for (54.4 minutes LAP versus 53.7 minutes PEG). Only one investigation commented on the discrepancy in direct costs between the two insertion techniques. On average, the procedure-related hospital charges during an LAP insertion visit were found to be $1050 higher than in PEG. Given that the study is single institutional and now 10 years out of date, these absolute cost numbers are likely inaccurate and hard to generalize. Increased operative time secondary to inexperience with laparoscopic equipment was the primary contributor to the increased cost affiliated with LAP.""

As there is currently no literature supporting patient age or weight as a predictive factor for success and safety of tube placement, we are unable to draw conclusions on the influence of these discrepancies of baseline demographics on the results.""
Reasoning: Limitations at the study and review level are discussed.
[Yes]

P26. Discussion / Conclusions
Quotes: ""The most commonly reported disadvantages of LAP over PEG are increased operative length and cost. Three of the 10 comparative studies commented on operative length, 2 of which reported a statistically significant decrease in operative time in the PEG group compared to LAP. However, Zamakhshary et al. [11] reported cumulative operative time (for the PEG group including conversion to low-profile button under general anesthesia) and reported no significant difference in operative length between the two techniques when this conversion was accounted for (54.4 minutes LAP versus 53.7 minutes PEG). Only one investigation commented on the discrepancy in direct costs between the two insertion techniques. On average, the procedure-related hospital charges during an LAP insertion visit were found to be $1050 higher than in PEG. Given that the study is single institutional and now 10 years out of date, these absolute cost numbers are likely inaccurate and hard to generalize. Increased operative time secondary to inexperience with laparoscopic equipment was the primary contributor to the increased cost affiliated with LAP.""
Reasoning: The conclusions provide an interpretation of the results in the context of other evidence and implications.
[Yes]

P3. Introduction / Rationale
Quote: ""The global prevalence of obesity is rising in children and adolescents (1). In the United Kingdom, e.g. among individuals aged 11–15 years, the prevalence was 14.7% in 1995 and 18.3% in the 2010 round of the National Child Measurement Programme (2). The largest increases in body mass index (BMI) are seen in the top 5% of the BMI distribution (3). Treatment guidelines for obese children from National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) recommend lifestyle intervention support, assessment of co-morbidities, and referral to secondary care if morbidities are present (3,4). Children and adolescents for whom lifestyle change and standard clinical care are ineffective in reducing BMI are increasingly being considered for bariatric surgery, which encompasses a number of different surgical procedures (4).""

Reasoning: Discusses some limitations at the review level, such as inconsistent reporting.
[Yes]

P26. Discussion / Conclusions
Quote: ""As bariatric surgery seems to be associated with a risk of complications and has the potential to impact on future patterns for a lifetime, a balance must be made between the potential benefits and harms at an individual case level. Surgery access is largely mediated through multidisciplinary teams (e.g. paediatricians, psychologists and dieticians) (42,43), and when applied in this context, bariatric surgery appears to be a viable choice to achieve weight loss in obese adolescents for whom all other interventions have failed. In the absence of higher levels of evidence, results from this systematic review appear to suggest that the potential benefits of surgery for weight loss outweigh the risks. Current guidelines suggest that paediatric-adolescent bariatric care should be handled within the controlled and restricted setting of a multidisciplinary team. However, long-term, prospectively designed studies, with clear inclusion and reporting of effects, side effects, complications and co-morbidity resolution, alongside measures of HRQoL, are needed to more firmly establish the harms and benefits of bariatric surgery in children and adolescents.""

Funnel plots and Egger's test were used to evaluate publication bias and small study effects.""
Reasoning: Describes the additional sensitivity analyses performed.
[Yes]

P17. Results / Study selection
Quote: ""A total of 2303 unique citations were returned by the search strategy (Fig. 1). Of these, 2185 were excluded based on abstract review. Two additional papers were included from references (n = 2)""
Reasoning: Provides a flow diagram with the numbers of studies screened, assessed for eligibility, and included.
[Yes]

Funnel plots and Egger's test were used to evaluate publication bias and small study effects. Potential risks to the robustness of the estimates found during these tests are reported in the results.""
Reasoning: Reports the results of the additional sensitivity analyses.
[Yes]

P24. Discussion / Summary of evidence
Quote: ""Bariatric surgery in obese children and adolescents is associated with a significant reduction in BMI after 12 months (average weighted mean BMI difference: −13.5 kg m−2; 95% CI −15.1, −11.9). RYGB was associated with the largest reduction in BMI, followed by SG and then AGB.""
Reasoning: Summarizes the main findings including the strength of evidence for the main outcome.
[Yes]

P25. Discussion / Limitations
Quote: ""There was some evidence to suggest that bariatric surgery is related to co-morbidity resolution, sleep apnoea, type 2 diabetes and dyslipidaemia, particularly with RYGB surgery. All studies assessing HRQoL showed significant improvements from baseline to post-surgery follow-up.""
Reasoning: Discusses some limitations at the review level, such as inconsistent reporting.
[Yes]

P26. Discussion / Conclusions
Quote: ""As bariatric surgery seems to be associated with a risk of complications and has the potential to impact on future patterns for a lifetime, a balance must be made between the potential benefits and harms at an individual case level. Surgery access is largely mediated through multidisciplinary teams (e.g. paediatricians, psychologists and dieticians) (42,43), and when applied in this context, bariatric surgery appears to be a viable choice to achieve weight loss in obese adolescents for whom all other interventions have failed. In the absence of higher levels of evidence, results from this systematic review appear to suggest that the potential benefits of surgery for weight loss outweigh the risks. Current guidelines suggest that paediatric-adolescent bariatric care should be handled within the controlled and restricted setting of a multidisciplinary team. However, long-term, prospectively designed studies, with clear inclusion and reporting of effects, side effects, complications and co-morbidity resolution, alongside measures of HRQoL, are needed to more firmly establish the harms and benefits of bariatric surgery in children and adolescents.""
Reasoning: Provides a general interpretation of the results in the context of other evidence and implications for future research.
[Yes]

P27. Funding
Quote: ""No conflict of interest was declared.""

""Some studies also reported on semen analysis in adulthood (i.e., sperm count, sperm concentration) [11, 25, 29–32, 35, 37, 38, 40, 41]. The overall consensus was that earlier orchiopexy had better outcomes; specifically, the highest quality study [11] showed that sperm count and highly motile spermatozoa were significantly increased when orchiopexy was performed at <1 year compared to 1–2 years of age.""
Reasoning: Publication bias was not assessed, likely because this was a systematic review without a meta-analysis.

P2
Quote: ""The ideal management of cryptorchidism is a highly debated topic within the field of pediatric surgery. The optimal timing of orchiopexy is particularly unclear, as existing literature reports mixed recommendations. The aim of this study was to determine, based on a systematic review, the most favorable age at which orchiopexy should be performed. We conducted a systematic search of MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, and the Cochrane Library to find relevant articles. Two researchers quality assessed each study using the following tools: AMSTAR (systematic reviews), Jadad (RCTs), and MINORS (non-RCTs). We developed a conclusion based on the highest quality studies. We found one relevant systematic review, one RCT, and 30 non-RCTs. Fertility potential was greatest when orchiopexy was performed before 1 year of age. Additionally, orchiopexy before 10–11 years may protect against the increased risk of testicular cancer associated with cryptorchidism. Orchiopexy should not be performed before 6 months of age, as testes may descend spontaneously during the first few months of life. The highest quality evidence recommends orchiopexy between 6 and 12 months of age. Surgery during this timeframe may optimize fertility potential and protect against testicular malignancy in children with cryptorchidism.""

This finding was consistent even when we performed a subgroup analysis with only the studies that reported follow-up time ≥12 months [10–12,14] (OR 3.21 [1.12, 9.18] p = 0.03, Fig. 3E).""
Reasoning: The results take into account the quality of included studies by performing subgroup analyses with higher quality studies.
[Yes]

A9. Were the methods used to combine the findings of studies appropriate?

Quote: ""The meta-analysis done by Cundy et al. [22] showed a borderline significantly lower estimated blood loss in RP group and no instance of blood transfusion was required. Usually, blood transfusion is rare in children undergoing pyeloplasty. However, the national survey of RP reported higher risks of blood transfusions in the RP group (1.2 %) than in OP (0.4 %) [4], which may reflect the real world of surgery done by general pediatric urologists, while the reported case–control series were reported by experienced laparoendoscopists. In general, the very narrow operation site, especially in children, which could prolong the learning curve for this robotic intervention, might cause practice, the higher transfusion, and complication rates in RP group. Moreover, it is likely that surgeons performed most of the robotic cases in their early learning phase. Lastly, the chance of technical error of robotics was around 5 %, in which conversion to standard laparoscopic pyeloplasty is required which highlights the need of keeping laparoscopic skills in performing robotic surgery [11].""

P26
Quote: ""The meta-analysis done by Cundy et al. [22] showed a borderline significantly lower estimated blood loss in RP group and no instance of blood transfusion was required. Usually, blood transfusion is rare in children undergoing pyeloplasty. However, the national survey of RP reported higher risks of blood transfusions in the RP group (1.2 %) than in OP (0.4 %) [4], which may reflect the real world of surgery done by general pediatric urologists, while the reported case–control series were reported by experienced laparoendoscopists. In general, the very narrow operation site, especially in children, which could prolong the learning curve for this robotic intervention, might cause practice, the higher transfusion, and complication rates in RP group. Moreover, it is likely that surgeons performed most of the robotic cases in their early learning phase. Lastly, the chance of technical error of robotics was around 5 %, in which conversion to standard laparoscopic pyeloplasty is required which highlights the need of keeping laparoscopic skills in performing robotic surgery [11].""

TERPT is a minimally invasive procedure, with the advantages of better cosmesis, less postoperative pain and avoidance of abdominal contamination [8]. Many studies have also suggested that TERPT reduces operative time and hospital stay compared to conventional open surgery, which is shown by our meta-analysis [14–19,22,24]. However, we note a significant heterogeneity among the studies for operative time and duration of hospital stay.

Almost all TERPTs were done as single-stage procedures while staged procedures with preoperative colostomy were common in many TABs (Table 1). In two studies, three groups (TERPT, single- and multi-stage TAB) were compared to each other; for these, we analyzed the single-stage TAB for comparison with TERPT [16,22].""

Quote: ""Our meta-analysis suggests that the TERPT is superior to the conventional TAB pull-through for Hirschsprung's disease. To our knowledge, this study is the first systematic review and meta-analysis comparing TERPT to TAB pull-through for Hirschsprung's disease.
TERPT is a minimally invasive procedure, with the advantages of better cosmesis, less postoperative pain and avoidance of abdominal contamination [8]. Many studies have also suggested that TERPT reduces operative time and hospital stay compared to conventional open surgery, which is shown by our meta-analysis [14–19,22,24]. However, we note a significant heterogeneity among the studies for operative time and duration of hospital stay. This heterogeneity may be attributed to variation in the skills of the surgeons and differences in postoperative care pathways in different centers.""
Reasoning: The authors summarize the main findings and their relevance to key groups.
[Yes]

P25
Quote: ""All TERPT procedures were performed after 1996, while the earliest open procedure included in this meta-analysis was from 1990. In the intervening years, factors other than the surgical approach, such as improvements in pediatric perioperative care, management of complications, or even administration-driven attention to length of hospital stay, may have partially contributed to the apparent better outcomes in the TERPT group.""
Reasoning: The authors discuss some limitations at the review level, such as differences between the TERPT and open procedure groups that could have influenced the findings.
[Yes]

P26
Quote: ""Postoperative enterocolitis is one of the main complications after pull-through surgery. The reported incidence of postoperative enterocolitis in the literature ranges from 4.6% to 54% [32]. A recent review showed that the incidence of postoperative and recurrent enterocolitis was markedly lower in TERPT (10% and 2% respectively) [32]. Our meta-analysis also showed a tendency to a lower incidence of enterocolitis in the TERPT group compared with TAB, although the difference was not statistically significant.""

MINORS scoring highlighted these fact(s) (Fig. 1).

""Although this systematic review favors a ""watchful waiting"" approach over prophylactic surgery in patients with heterotaxy, what exactly this should constitute is not standardized. Those 5 papers advocating a conservative approach of the asymptomatic patients emphasize the need for ""regular"" or ""close"" follow-up, and where this is not possible, or when symptoms develop, imaging is warranted.""
Limitations such as lack of standardization of the watchful waiting approach are discussed.

""We fully acknowledge that there are some limitations with the present study. Follow-up reporting data in studies we analyzed was sometimes poor. This may influence long-term outcome(s) of both a ""watchful waiting"" policy and operative intervention. Adequate reporting in studies was thus by no means always satisfactory. MINORS scoring highlighted these fact(s) (Fig. 1). Here, we found that little reference was made in many studies as to the nature of cardiac comorbidity(s) and cardiac mortality out with the perioperative period. It is heart anomalies, which most often are the determinant of life expectancy guiding the appropriateness of surgical correction of IRA. All studies included were retrospective observational studies with no valid comparator group (Oxford EBM—Level IV evidence32). As a result, there were some significant inherent bias(s) indicating interpretation of studies with care.""
The authors acknowledge limitations with the data and studies analyzed.

P24 - Summary of evidence
Quote: ""This review reports the findings from one RCT (50 participants). The intervention focused on laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding surgery, which was compared to a control group receiving a multi component lifestyle program. The study authors were unable to blind their participants, personnel and outcome assessors which may have resulted in a high risk of performance and detection bias. At 24 months follow-up, the mean change in BMI units was 12.7 (95% CI 11.3 to 14.2) for the surgery group compared to 1.3 (95% CI 0.4 to 2.9) for the control group. Adverse events were reported in 12/25 participants in the intervention group compared to 11/25 in the control group.""

P24. Discussion / Summary of evidence
Quotes: ""With this meta-analysis on complications and long-term outcome in newborns with LGEA managed by DPA, we provide an overview of the available patient cohorts that were published so far. Based on this data, it is recommended to perform a DPA when the patient is 2–4 months old. At this age, the distance between the two ends usually is <2.0 cm [22–24]. Successful primary anastomosis with delays of up to 12 months [25] and initial gaps of up to 7.0 cm [26] or eight vertebral bodies [27] have been reported (Fig. 5).""
Reasoning: The discussion summarizes the main findings and their relevance to key groups like healthcare providers.
[Yes]

P25. Discussion / Limitations
Quotes: ""In most studies, early complications after DPA were leaks, which occurred in up to 50 % of their patients [20, 22, 23, 25, 28–40]. Most of the anastomotic leaks were minor and subsided spontaneously on total parenteral nutrition without the need for surgical intervention. However, some investigators reported major disruption and failure of conservative management with need for drainage or reoperation in up to 15 % of their cases [38, 40].""
Reasoning: The discussion addresses some limitations at the study level like the high incidence of leaks and need for reinterventions in some studies. However, review-level limitations like incomplete retrieval of studies or reporting biases are not discussed.
[No]

P26. Discussion / Conclusions
Quotes: ""In conclusion, this meta-analysis shows that the DPA provides good long-term functional results. However, the high incidence of GER and associated strictures requires early intervention to prevent ongoing feeding problems due to strictures and esophagitis. Long-term follow-up is recommended because of the potential risk of Barrett's metaplasia.""

P26. Discussion / Conclusions
Quote: ""Our review would support the following management algorithm: When a patient is diagnosed with malrotation as a result of a screening study, particularly on another study, consideration should be given to three factors: 1) presence of symptoms, 2) status of cardiac disease, and 3) age. All patients need to undergo an UGI to confirm the diagnosis. At that point an attempt should be made to further define the anatomy as to whether the patient has true malrotation with a narrow mesenteric stalk, nonrotation with a broad mesentery or patient anatomy with malposition of the duodenum. Patients who are symptomatic should undergo a diagnostic laparoscopy and Ladd procedure but normal anatomy is confirmed. True malrotation may be considered abnormal. Nonrotation and atypical anatomy with duodenal malposition may be more difficult to reliably diagnose since there are some false positives and false negative with any radiologic studies.""
