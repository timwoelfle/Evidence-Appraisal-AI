1773,9,4,4,5,5,2,5,5,5,4,"Here are the PRECIS-2 scores and explanations for the trial based on the full text in ""1773.pdf"":

Eligibility criteria

Quotes:
- ""Patient inclusion criteria included a confirmed disease diagnosis by a neurologist, according to Mc-Donald criteria (McDonald, 2001); ability to walk (with or without aid) at least 20 m without rest; absence of other diseases that might have affected muscle function.""
- ""None of the patients had previous experience with resistance training.""

Explanation: The inclusion criteria seem fairly broad - patients only need to be diagnosed by a neurologist and able to walk 20m without rest. The only notable exclusion is prior resistance training experience, which makes sense in assessing the effect of a resistance training intervention. Overall, the criteria seem fairly pragmatic.

Score: [4] 

Recruitment

Quotes:
- ""After a group meeting where the details of the investigation were described to the patients, including possible risks and discomfort associated to the intervention, a formal invitation to take part in the study was offered."" 
- ""All training sessions took place in MS rehabilitation centers and the patients were continuously supervised by physical therapists.""

Explanation: Patients were recruited through MS rehabilitation centers where they were already receiving care. No additional recruitment efforts beyond the group meeting seem to have been made. Recruiting through usual care settings is a pragmatic approach.

Score: [4]

Setting

Quotes:
- ""All participants were recruited among six MS rehabilitation centers within the region of Castilla y León (Spain).""
- ""All training sessions took place in MS rehabilitation centers and the patients were continuously supervised by physical therapists.""

Explanation: Conducting the trial in the same rehabilitation centers where patients were receiving usual care is a pragmatic choice of setting. Multiple centers were used as well.

Score: [5]

Organization

Quotes:
- ""Subjects performed 3 sets of 8–12 reps with a load that was progressively increased from 35 to 70% of MVIC through the training period (Table 2). Recovery time between sets was 3 minutes."" 
- ""All training sessions took place in MS rehabilitation centers and the patients were continuously supervised by physical therapists.""

Explanation: The intervention was delivered by physical therapists during usual rehabilitation sessions, without requiring additional expertise, training, or resources. This matches usual care and is pragmatic.

Score: [5] 

Flexibility: Delivery

Quotes:
- ""Subjects were requested to push with maximal effort during the concentric phase of the movement (90–180°) and to lower the load (eccentric action; 180–90°) in a controlled manner.""
- ""Table 2 shows the progressive loading scheme used during the resistance training program.""

Explanation: The resistance training protocol is clearly specified, including number of sets/reps, load, and concentric/eccentric timing. This reduces flexibility in delivery and is more explanatory.

Score: [2]

Flexibility: Adherence

Quotes: None relevant

Explanation: There is no mention of any measures to enforce or monitor adherence by patients. This suggests a pragmatic approach.

Score: [5] 

Follow-up

Quotes:
- ""Testing was performed on three different occasions: before (week 0) and after (week 12) the training program, and after the detraining period (week 24).""

Explanation: Follow-up is limited to testing at baseline, after training, and after detraining. This matches what would occur in usual care and is pragmatic.

Score: [5]

Primary Outcome

Quotes:
- ""Dependent variables included maximal voluntary isometric contraction (MVIC), maximal torque, average power and muscle endurance.""

Explanation: The primary outcomes of strength, power, and endurance are clinically meaningful to patients. This is pragmatic.

Score: [5]

Primary Analysis 

Quotes:
- ""Data were analyzed using SPSS® 17.0 (SPSS Inc., USA).""
- ""To assess any training or detraining effect, as well as any difference between groups, MVIC, torque, average power and muscle endurance raw values were examined using two-way ANOVA with repeated measurements for group and time.""

Explanation: The analysis approach is not explicitly described but seems to follow intention-to-treat principles by including all participants and using repeated measures ANOVA. This is pragmatic.

""Assessment included: EDSS, FS, AI, ISS, in the 6th and 12th week an overall impression by both the patient and the neurologist in a 7-point scale (from much worse via unchanged to much better), and on a 3-point scale (worse, unchanged, better) in the 6th, 9th and 12th month.""

Explanation: Participants were followed closely with multiple assessments over 12 months. This is more frequent than usual care.

Score: [2] 

Domain 8 - Primary outcome

Quotes:

""In some Kurtzke Functional Systems, the Ambulation Index and the Kurtzke Incapacity Scale a transient greater improvement in the ACTH-treated patients was observed.""

Explanation: The primary outcomes of functional systems, ambulation, and disability scales are clinically relevant but may require specialized training to assess.

695,9,3,5,4,2,4,5,3,5,NA,"Here are the PRECIS-2 domain scores and explanations for the trial described in ""695.pdf"":

1. Eligibility criteria

Relevant quotes:
- ""Participants eligible for inclusion were adults aged over 15 years with one of the following possible recorded diagnoses: MS, PD and other causes of progressive parkinsonism, motor neurone disease, Huntington's disease and other degenerative disorders affecting the central nervous system, muscles or peripheral nerves.""
- ""In order to preserve a focus on primarily physical disabilities, dementing disorders such as Alzheimer's disease were not included.""  
- ""Participants whose clinical features appeared incompatible with the recorded diagnosis were excluded, as were those with neurological complications of primarily non-neurological conditions such as diabetes mellitus, or additional causes of severe disability.""

The eligibility criteria are reasonably broad, including adults over 15 years old with a range of progressive neurological conditions affecting physical function. However, some common exclusions are made, such as for dementing disorders and diabetes complications, that may limit generalizability. Overall, the criteria seem moderately pragmatic.

Score: [3]

2. Recruitment

Relevant quotes:
- ""To avoid ascertainment bias towards people already receiving specific health or social services, we used GP information as the sole method for identifying potential participants.""

Participants were identified solely through GP records and referrals, avoiding additional recruitment efforts that could bias the sample. This routine recruitment approach matches how patients would present in usual care.

Score: [5] 

3. Setting

Relevant quotes:  
- ""The study took place between August 1997 and March 2000 and was approved by the research ethics committee of Queen's Medical Centre (Nottingham, UK).""
- ""From July 1998 we approached the 177 GPs based within the City of Nottingham boundaries (population 282000).""
- ""Participants' homes in the City of Nottingham.""

The trial was conducted in participants' homes in a specific city in the UK. While a single city may limit generalizability, conducting the trial in patients' actual homes matches the real-world setting.

Score: [4]

4. Organization

Relevant quotes:
- ""In the EG, baseline data were reviewed by an expert panel which advised on actions most likely to promote each individual's physical, social and psychological well-being.""  
- ""An occupational therapist (OT) then visited EG participants to provide education and information and to discuss a personalized 12-month health action plan.""

The intervention involves an expert panel review and home visits from an OT to provide personalized education. This likely requires more resources and coordination than usual care.

Score: [2] 

5. Flexibility (delivery)

Relevant quotes:
- ""An occupational therapist (OT) then visited EG participants to provide education and information and to discuss a personalized 12-month health action plan.""
- ""Approximately two weeks later, EG participants received a single follow-through phone call from the research OT to confirm and reinforce the educational content of the visit, after which EG patients had no subsequent contact with the OT""

The education delivery seems reasonably flexible, involving a personalized discussion and plan between the OT and participant. Only 1 follow-up call was made to reinforce the education.

Score: [4]

6. Flexibility (adherence)

Relevant quotes:
No discussion of measures to enforce adherence.

The trial does not appear to monitor or enforce adherence to the education intervention. This matches the flexibility seen in usual practice.

Score: [5]

7. Follow-up

Relevant quotes:  
- ""Information on adverse events was collected by phone at two-monthly intervals between baseline and 12-month assessments, when a general enquiry was made without specific reference to falls or sores.""
- ""To inform the expert panel, an assessor carried out a broad-ranging baseline interview, which included the Braden scale for risk of skin sores,14 risk factors for falling,l and self-reported service utilization.""

Follow-up intensity seems moderately pragmatic - participants were contacted every 2 months by phone without extensive data collection. However, more detailed baseline and 12 month in-person assessments were performed.

Score: [3]

8. Primary outcome

Relevant quotes:
- ""Primary outcome measures were reports of one or more falls or skin sores. At interview, participants were asked 'In the past 12 months, have you fallen? Have you had a skin sore?'""

The primary outcomes of falls and skin sores are directly relevant adverse events for patients with neurological conditions. 

Score: [5]

9. Primary analysis

1769,9,3,4,4,5,2,NA,3,4,NA,"Here are the PRECIS-2 scores for the clinical trial described in the attached paper ""1769.pdf"":

Eligibility criteria

Quotes: 
""Patients with multiple sclerosis were randomly selected into treated and control groups; only patients who could walk with or without walking aids were admitted to the trial, and these cases were initially assessed and scored during an inactive phase of the disease.""

""Patients with diabetes mellitus or hypertension or who gave a history of psychiatric illness or peptic ulcer were not admitted to the treated group."" 

Score: [3] 

The eligibility criteria are moderately pragmatic - patients had to have a diagnosis of MS and be ambulatory, which matches the target population, but other exclusions like diabetes, hypertension, and psychiatric illness make it less pragmatic.

Recruitment

Quotes: 
""This controlled study was started in 1963 in three cities-Belfast, Leeds, and Manchester.""

""A separate trial was carried out in the three centres using the same treatment and scoring methods. Patients with multiple sclerosis were randomly selected into treated and control groups;""

Score: [4] 

Patients were recruited from multiple centers, suggesting a pragmatic recruitment approach. However, no details are provided on how exactly patients were recruited.

Setting

Quotes:
""This controlled study was started in 1963 in three cities-Belfast, Leeds, and Manchester."" 

Score: [4]

The trial was conducted across three cities, suggesting a reasonably pragmatic setting.

Organization

Quotes:
""The treated group were given corticotrophin (’ Acthar ’ gel) in a dosage which varied between 15 and 25 units daily, potassium chloride orally, and a low-salt diet.""

Score: [5] 

The intervention appears to be delivered as part of routine care without substantial additional resources, suggesting a very pragmatic approach.

Flexibility: Delivery

Quotes:
""The dose of corticotrophin was adjusted to produce just enough "" mooning "" of the face to be appreciated by the physician in charge of the trial and the dose was not increased during a relapse.""

Score: [2]

The corticotrophin dosage was standardized based on a specific physician assessment (""mooning"" of the face), suggesting an explanatory approach.

Flexibility: Adherence

Score: [NA]

No relevant information provided in the text.

Follow-up

Quotes:  
""All cases were seen at three-monthly intervals and scored on the Kurtzke (1961) scale; relapses lasting longer than twenty-four hours were also scored by a system in the three centres.""

Score: [3] 

Follow-up every 3 months is more frequent than usual care but not excessively burdensome.

Primary outcome

Quotes:
""There is no evidence to suggest that the treated group do better than the controls, either from the point of view of deterioration or reduction in number or severity of relapses.""

Score: [4] 

Deterioration and relapse rate/severity seem like pragmatic and clinically meaningful outcomes.

685,9,5,4,2,3,5,NA,4,5,3,"Here are the PRECIS-2 domain scores and justifications for the trial described in ""685.pdf"":

Eligibility criteria

Quotes:
- ""The only selection criterion was that the diagnosis of MS was confirmed by the general practitioner.""
- ""There were no exclusion criteria.""

Reasoning: The trial had very broad eligibility criteria, including anyone with a confirmed diagnosis of MS. There were no exclusions based on age, comorbidities, disease severity, ability to adhere to treatment, or any other factors. This reflects a very pragmatic approach, allowing the results to be widely generalizable.

Score: [5] 

Recruitment 
Quotes:
- ""Participants were volunteers with MS who were recruited through voluntary organizations, were community based and lived in West London and in counties contiguous with Greater London.""

Reasoning: Participants were recruited through MS voluntary organizations rather than clinic visits or medical records. This requires some extra effort compared to recruiting during routine care. However, it seems reasonably feasible that this recruitment approach could occur in usual care.

Score: [4]

Setting
Quote: 
- ""It was a community-based research study, which was approved by the appropriate local research ethics committees, and was conducted at the Centre for Research in Rehabilitation at Brunel University’s Osterley Campus in West London from June 1996 until February 1999.""

Reasoning: The setting was a university research center rather than a community clinic or other real-world care setting. This reduces the pragmatism of the trial.

Score: [2] 

Organization
Quotes:
- ""The intervention comprised discussion of self-care based on client priorities, using an information booklet about self-care."" 
- ""Sessions were conducted either at participants’ homes or in local therapy centres.""
- ""The discussions lasted between 1 and 2 hours and were conducted on two occasions, over a one month period.""

Reasoning: The intervention required trained staff to deliver it, which is more resources than usual care. However, it was reasonably brief and delivered in homes/community centers. Overall, it requires some additional resources compared to usual care.

Score: [3]

Flexibility: Delivery
Quotes:
- ""As findings from the Delphi study highlighted the need for flexibility and responsiveness to individuals the format of the discussion focused on individuals’ interests and concerns rather than on covering all the information contained in the booklet.""
- ""Individuals were assigned to group or one to one sessions by the health professional in consultation with each person, and based on their needs and wishes.""

Reasoning: The delivery allowed flexibility in format based on individual needs and interests. There was no strict protocol. This matches usual care.

Score: [5] 

Flexibility: Adherence
Quotes: None relevant

Reasoning: Adherence does not seem applicable for this informational intervention. There is no medication or regimen for patients to adhere to.

Score: [NA]

Follow-up
Quotes:  
- ""Follow-up assessments were conducted six months after baseline.""
- ""The blind code was broken after the final follow-up assessments had occurred.""

Reasoning: Participants were followed up at 6 months, with no other contacts in between. This matches reasonably well with follow-up in usual long-term MS care.

Score: [4]

Primary outcome
Quotes:
- ""Total scores on a postal version of the Barthel Index, a scale measuring mobility, the SF-36, and one measure developed for the study; the Standard Day Dependency Record (SDDR), were the main outcome measures.""

Reasoning: The outcomes measured mobility, quality of life, and independence in daily activities. These are highly patient-centered and relevant for MS.

Score: [5]

Primary analysis
Quote:
- ""Missing values on scales were replaced with group means for each outcome measure. It was not possible to perform an ‘intention to treat’ analysis as those individuals who declined the intervention also withdrew from follow-up and therefore did not complete any follow-up assessments.""

Reasoning: An intention-to-treat analysis was not done since some patients withdrew after declining intervention. However, missing data was accounted for reasonably. This seems moderately pragmatic. 

Score: [3]

684,9,4,4,5,5,5,5,4,5,5,"Here are the PRECIS-2 scores for the trial described in the attached paper ""684.pdf"":

Eligibility criteria:

Relevant quotes:
- ""Subjects had a definite diagnosis of primary or secondary progressive MS, and an EDSS of between 6.5 (constant bilateral assistance required to walk about 20 metres without resting) to 8 (essentially restricted to bed or chair or perambulated in wheelchair, but may be out of bed much of the day, retains many self-care functions and generally has effective use of arms).""
- ""People with MS who were medically stable were selected where cognitive function was adequate, as assessed by a Mini Mental State Examination score of 23 or over and had at least three identifiable physiotherapy goals were included."" 
- ""Potential subjects were excluded if they had rapidly progressing disease, were already involved in a physiotherapy programme, had additional neurological conditions or other medical conditions which would preclude them taking part in the study.""

The eligibility criteria target patients with moderate to severe MS who would be candidates for physiotherapy in usual care. The exclusion criteria remove patients with rapidly progressing disease who would not be suitable. The additional requirement of at least 3 physiotherapy goals ensures selected patients will benefit from the intervention. Overall, the criteria seem very similar to usual care.

Score: [4]

Recruitment:

Relevant quotes:
- ""People moderately to severely affected by MS were recruited from the MS Service, NHS Ayrshire and Arran.""

Patients were recruited from an MS service, which is likely the normal source for this population in usual care. No additional recruitment methods were mentioned.

Score: [4] 

Setting:

Relevant quotes:
- ""Subjects assigned to Group 1 received physiotherapy, twice weekly for eight weeks, by an experienced domiciliary physiotherapist within their home.""

The setting was patients' own homes, which matches usual care for moderate to severe MS patients.

Score: [5]

Organization:

Relevant quotes: 
- ""Each session lasted up to 60 minutes, and a task-specific programme included upper and lower limb strengthening using theraband, mobile pedals, and weights. Repetition of tasks such as sit to stand, gait, balance (using gym balls and sit fits) and stretching activities were used depending on the subjects previously identified goals.""

The intervention was delivered by physiotherapists using resources that would be standard in usual care. No additional training or expertise was mentioned.

Score: [5] 

Flexibility (delivery):

Relevant quotes:
- ""Each subject therefore received core treatments aimed to maximize strength, flexibility and function.""

A tailored program was designed for each patient based on goals. This matches the flexibility expected in usual physiotherapy care.

Score: [5]

Flexibility (adherence): 

No discussion of measures to enforce adherence.

Score: [5] 

Follow-up:

Relevant quotes:  
- ""Subjects in both groups were assessed at the beginning and at the end of the eight-week intervention period (i.e. either physiotherapy or control) and then again eight weeks later.""
- ""To improve the reliability of the data, all assessments were undertaken at the Douglas Grant Rehabilitation Centre, Irvine, and the assessor remained blind to the subjects’ treatment group allocation.""

Follow-up matches the intervention period with an additional assessment 8 weeks later. Assessments were done at a center rather than home. Frequency is reasonable but location differs from purely usual care.

Score: [4] 

Primary outcome:

Relevant quotes:
- ""The MS impact scale (MSIS 29), which is a measure of the physical and psychological impact of MS, was the primary outcome measure for the study."" 

The MSIS measures outcomes directly relevant to patients.

Score: [5]

Primary analysis:

Relevant quote: 
- ""Where there were problems with missing data due to dropouts/non-completion, the simple repeated measures ANOVA was replaced with a general linear model where missing data are estimated within the model.""

An intention-to-treat approach was used with statistical methods to account for missing data.

Eligibility criteria

Quotes: 
""To be eligible, all patients screened for study participation had to be affected by clinically definite multiple sclerosis and live in the Rome service area.""

""Eligible patients were assessed for suitability by the coordinator of the home based care team (LP)."" 

Reasoning: The eligibility criteria require patients to have clinically definite multiple sclerosis, which is reasonable for this trial. Patients also had to live in the Rome service area, which may limit generalizability somewhat but is likely similar to eligibility criteria in usual care. The coordinator further assessed patients for suitability, which introduces some selectivity beyond typical eligibility. Overall, the criteria seem moderately pragmatic.

Score: [3] 

Recruitment

Quotes:
""Patients were recruited from the multiple sclerosis centre of the neurological department of La Sapienza University, or from other institutional centres for multiple sclerosis in Rome.""

Reasoning: Patients were recruited through multiple sclerosis clinics, which is a pragmatic approach similar to how patients would present for treatment in usual care. No additional recruitment efforts beyond standard clinic visits are mentioned.

Score: [5]

Setting

Quotes: 
""The study was conducted in Rome""

""Patients were recruited from the multiple sclerosis centre of the neurological department of La Sapienza University, or from other institutional centres for multiple sclerosis in Rome.""

Score: [NA]

Follow-up

Quotes:
""At the end of a one year follow up period, all patients underwent the same comprehensive interview as at baseline.""

Reasoning: Patients were followed for 1 year, which exceeds typical follow-up in usual care. However, follow-up assessments were done only at baseline and 1 year, with no additional visits in between. This seems moderately pragmatic.

Score: [3]

Primary outcome

Quotes:
""Functional outcomes were calculated as the mean change of scores from baseline to the final follow up at 12 months.""

733,9,4,4,5,4,4,4,4,5,5,"Here are the PRECIS-2 scores and explanations for the trial based on the publication:

Eligibility criteria

Quotes: 
- ""Patients were eligible to participate if they were: community dwelling aged ≥65 years; independently mobile (with or without a walking aid); and physically able to take part in group exercise.""
- ""Patients were excluded if they: had experienced ≥3 falls in the previous year; had unstable clinical conditions; would be unable to follow instructions about exercise safely; or were receiving palliative care.""

Explanation: The eligibility criteria are fairly broad, including community-dwelling adults aged 65+ who are mobile and can participate in exercise. The exclusions are mainly for safety reasons in patients who are seriously ill, at high fall risk, or unable to follow instructions. This matches typical eligibility for exercise programs in this population.

Score: [4]

Quotes:
- ""Practices were recruited with assistance from Primary Care Research Networks for London, Derby, and Nottingham.""  
- ""Patients aged ≥65 years were identified by searches of computerised medical records and invited to participate by letter from their GP.""

Explanation: Participants were recruited through their regular GP practices by searching medical records and sending invitation letters. This is a fairly pragmatic recruitment approach leveraging existing primary care resources and records. More intensive advertising or incentives were not used.

Score: [4] 

Setting
Quote: 
- ""A three-arm, parallel-design cluster controlled trial was used, with allocation at the level of general practice in two centres (London and Nottingham/Derby).""

Explanation: The trial was conducted in multiple general practices in London and Nottingham/Derby, matching the typical primary care setting where the intervention would be implemented. No specialist centers were used.

Score: [5]

Organization 
Quotes:
- ""Volunteer peer mentors supported participants in the OEP arm, and weekly FaME classes were run in local venues by postural stability instructors trained to work with older people.""
- ""All FaME classes were fully staffed but recruitment of peer mentors was difficult...and not all participants in the OEP arm received per protocol peer mentor support.""

Explanation: The interventions leveraged existing local resources like venues and some additional trained instructors. Volunteer peer mentors were intended to provide support but this was not fully implemented due to recruitment difficulties. Overall the organization is fairly typical for what would be available in these settings.

Score: [4]  

Flexibility: Delivery
Quotes: 
- ""The FaME intervention took place in a group once a week and included exercises to be carried out at home, unsupervised, twice weekly.""  
- ""The OEP was undertaken at home, unsupervised, and comprised exercises to be done three times per week.""

Explanation: The exercise interventions were prescribed but the delivery allows flexibility in how participants complete the exercises at home with minimal supervision. This matches typical flexibility in exercise recommendations.

Score: [4]

Flexibility: Adherence
Quotes: 
- No mention of specific measures to enforce adherence.
- ""There was no evidence of difference in primary outcome between adherers and non-adherers for either analysis.""

Explanation: Adherence was measured but there were no specific strategies described to improve adherence, exclude or withdraw participants based on adherence. This suggests a pragmatic approach.

Score: [4] 

Follow-up
Quotes:
- ""Participants were followed up every 6 months after the end of the intervention period, until 24 months.""
- ""The primary time point was chosen as 12 months post-intervention to match other trials.""

Explanation: Follow-up was at 6 month intervals for 2 years, with the primary outcome at 12 months. This does not seem substantially different from typical follow-up that would occur.

Score: [4]

Primary Outcome
Quotes:  
- ""The primary outcome was the proportion reaching the recommended physical activity target 12 months post-intervention."" 
- ""Physical activity was assessed using three validated questionnaires: Phone-FITT, the Physical Activity Scale for the Elderly (PASE), and the Community Healthy Activities Model Program for Seniors (CHAMPS).""

Explanation: The primary outcome of physical activity level is highly relevant for participants in exercise trials. It was measured by self-report instruments commonly used in these settings.

Eligibility criteria

Relevant quotes:
- ""Inclusion criteria were patients aged 45-65 with mild and moderate COPD (grade II and III) as the primary disease.""
- ""Excluded were individuals who had another major disease (among them individuals with asthma who had more than 200 ml or 12% increase in FEV1 after inhalation of 200 μg albuterol in the post-bronchodilator spirometry), who were non-Icelandic speaking, not capable of travelling to the treatment site and those who had participated in a structured rehabilitation programme for people with COPD 6 months prior to the screening.""

Reasoning: The inclusion criteria target patients with mild to moderate COPD, which matches the intended population for the self-management program. The exclusions are reasonable and aim to isolate the effect of COPD. Overall, the criteria seem reasonably pragmatic.

Score: [4]

Recruitment

Relevant quotes:
- ""An invitation letter signed by the patient’s physician was sent to potential participants explaining that the study was a clinical, family trial and that as a client of the physician, the person had been identified as a possible participant and that in addition, participation by a close family member was requested."" 
- ""One to two weeks later the patient was contacted by phone. In the phone call, possibilities for participation were explored. An appointment at the research centre was set up for those who accepted the invitation.""

Reasoning: Participants were identified from medical records and contacted by mail and phone, which requires some additional effort compared to approaching patients directly during clinic visits. However, this seems reasonable for recruiting patients spread across multiple sites. Overall, fairly pragmatic.

Score: [4] 

Setting

Relevant quotes:
- ""All potentially relevant patients (n = 291) were contacted for enrolment in the study from primary healthcare settings (n = 8) and the offices of private lung physicians (n = 6) in the Reykjavik capital area of Iceland.""
- ""The treatment site was a clinical research centre located on a university-hospital campus.""

Reasoning: Participants were recruited from primary care and physician offices where they would normally receive care. The treatment was delivered at a research center, which is slightly less pragmatic but overall the setting seems reasonably matched to real world care.

Eligibility criteria

Quotes:
""Eligible participants were male 35–65 yr old with a BMI of ≥28 kg/m2 and met PA safety requirements (i.e., no risk indicated by the Physical Activity Readiness Questionnaire [36] or clearance from a health care provider).""

""Age and BMI restrictions reflect evidence suggesting the following: 1) overweight/obese men in their mid-30s may experience an attitudinal shift in relation to their health, increasing their receptiveness to change health behaviors, and 2) men who are obese or at risk for becoming obese are more likely to want to lose weight (16).""

Explanation: The trial included men aged 35-65 years with BMI ≥28 kg/m2, reflecting the target population for the intervention if implemented in real-world practice. The eligibility criteria match the intended recipients based on evidence of when men become receptive to lifestyle changes. No exclusions were made based on ability to adhere to the intervention. Overall, the eligibility criteria appear to closely match the intended real-world recipients.

""Details were provided in the protocol, but coaches were able to adapt delivery based on participants' needs and engagement.""

Explanation: The classroom sessions and exercises allowed for flexibility in delivery, tailored to the participants. Coaches could adapt components as needed. The protocol gave a framework while allowing for individualized delivery. Overall, the flexibility of delivery appears pragmatic.

Score: [4]

Flexibility of experimental intervention - adherence

Quotes:

""A highly pragmatic design approach would allow for full flexibility in how end user recipients engage with the intervention."" 

""In usual care, health professionals encourage patients to take medication or follow therapy as best they can, and such encouragement would not count against a pragmatic design; if it also happens in usual care, allowing it in the trial is a pragmatic design decision.""

Explanation: There is no mention of specific measures to enforce or monitor adherence. The trial appears to have allowed flexibility in adherence matching usual care encouragement. 

Score: [4] 

Follow-up

Quotes:

""Follow-up occurred at 12 wk (both groups) and 12 months (intervention group only).""

""Measurement at baseline and 12 wk (both groups) and 12 months (intervention group only) included clinical outcomes (e.g., weight) and self-reported physical activity, diet, and self-rated health.""

715,9,4,5,5,5,5,NA,4,5,5,"Here are the PRECIS-2 domain scores and reasoning based on the full text publication:

Eligibility criteria

Relevant quotes:

""The inclusion criteria were: a positive diagnosis of RA (1987 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria), age 18 years or older and the ability to complete questionnaires unaided. Exclusions were: unstabilised concomitant disease, awaiting surgery and already receiving care from the practitioners involved in the study.""

""Patients ≥ 3 with acute respiratory tract infections. Exclusions not common cold but severe respiratory tract infections, peptic ulcer and asthma. But even asthma patients who were not sensitive to ibuprofen or aspirin eligible. Pregnant or breast feeding women are discouraged from taking ibuprofen when pregnant but can take as low a dose as possible of Paracetemol but as both being tested in the trial cannot include this group as participants. If include visually impaired increase organisation of trial (as in carers have to assist diary completion) but that would be norm and usual if prescribed ibuprofen or Paracetemol or steam treatment in usual care, so just easier for trialists to exclude. Small proportion of participants – so why exclude? Depressed and people with psychosis unreliable diary fillers, concerned with other things.""

Reasoning: The eligibility criteria are relatively inclusive, requiring only a diagnosis of RA based on standard ACR criteria and age 18+ along with ability to complete questionnaires. The exclusions are limited to unstable concomitant diseases, awaiting surgery, and already receiving care from the practitioners in the study. These eligibility criteria seem fairly pragmatic and similar to what would be used in usual care.

Score: [4]

Recruitment

Relevant quotes: 

""After gaining patient consent, demographics and disease activity score in 28 joints (DAS28), patients were randomly assigned using a remote secure telephone randomisation service provided by Leeds University Clinical Trials Research Unit.""

Reasoning: Patients were recruited during regular clinic visits after being diagnosed. No special efforts beyond usual care were mentioned. Central randomization was used but this alone does not affect recruitment pragmatism.

Score: [5] 

Setting

Relevant quotes:

""This study was conducted in outpatient clinics of 10 rheumatology centres across the UK.""

Reasoning: The study was conducted across 10 rheumatology clinics in the UK. This multicenter design matches usual care settings where patients would receive treatment.

""NLC interventions usually include allocated 30-min time slots in which the CNS takes history, performs physical examination, pain control, prescribing or recommending medication and dosage changes, intra-articular or intramuscular steroid injections, provision of patient education, psychosocial support and ordering blood tests or X-rays. Referrals for ward admission, to the rheumatologist or other health professionals, were carried out as appropriate."" 

Reasoning: The care was provided by regular rheumatology nurses and rheumatologists with typical experience levels. The nurse-led clinics were organized similar to usual care clinics, with adequate 30 minute slots for comprehensive care. No extra staffing or resources were mentioned.

Score: [5] 

Flexibility: delivery

Relevant quotes:

""The usual RLC is similar to the above except that it usually involves an allocated 15-min time slot.""

""Both practitioners saw patients according to the protocol and any extra visits or admissions were recorded.""

Reasoning: Apart from protocol-defined visit schedule, the delivery of the intervention in both arms appears to have been flexible based on providers' discretion, matching usual practice. No strict protocol, monitoring, or measures to improve compliance were described.

Score: [5]

Score: [NA]

The publication does not provide enough information to assess the flexibility around patient adherence.

7. Follow-up

Relevant quotes:

- ""After the randomization visit, follow-up appointments were arranged for both groups at 3, 9 and 12 months."" 

- ""At each follow-up visit, the general health status of the patient was assessed, medical treatment was revised and optimized, educational reinforcement was provided, 6-minute walk test (6MWT) and spirometry tests were carried out and HRQoL measures were taken.""

Score: [3] Equally pragmatic/explanatory

Follow-up visits were scheduled every 3 months, which provides some intensity. However, the assessments done seem fairly routine. The frequency and intensity of follow-up seems a mix of pragmatic and explanatory elements.

8. Primary outcome

Relevant quotes:

- ""Exercise tolerance (the ability to sustain exercise) was assessed using distance covered in the 6-min walk test (6MWT).""

- ""Health-related quality of life (HRQoL) was measured using a generic instrument (SF-36) and the Chronic Respiratory Disease Questionnaire (CRQ)."" 

Score: [5] Very pragmatic

The primary outcomes of exercise tolerance and quality of life are highly relevant and important to patients. They also seem to be measured in a similar way as would be done in usual practice.

9. Primary analysis

Relevant quotes:

- ""Missing values were not imputed. All patients were analyzed in the group to which they were randomized.""

- ""Secondly, additional analyses were conducted using linear mixed models, adjusted for baseline values and including time-group interaction terms.""

Score: [4] Rather pragmatic

An intention-to-treat approach was used with no imputation. Additional analyses were done, but the primary analysis seems to align with a pragmatic approach.

""Both problem solving and reattribution techniques were intended to result in action plans indicating how patients would achieve their personal goals.""

Explanation: The intervention involved specific techniques and structured processes for delivery, reducing flexibility compared to pure usual care. However, it allowed for some individualization in defining problems and goals. Overall this makes the delivery moderately pragmatic.

Flexibility of experimental intervention - Adherence:

Relevant quotes:

No relevant quotes found.

Explanation: The paper does not provide information about measures to enforce or monitor adherence. In the absence of evidence, this domain cannot be scored.

Score: [NA] 

Follow-up:

Relevant quotes:

""Outcomes were measured at baseline and at 4-month and 12-month follow-ups.""

""In 10% of the sample, one follow-up measurement was missing. Three patients did not complete the baseline measurement and gave informed consent at the 4-month follow-up measurement. Another 23 patients completed only the baseline measurement.""

Explanation: Follow-up was limited to two post-intervention assessments at 4 and 12 months. Around 10-15% of patients missed one or both follow-ups. This intensity seems moderately pragmatic compared to pure usual care.

Score: [3]

Primary outcome: 

Relevant quotes:

""The primary outcome measure was a dichotomised score on a Visual Analogue Scale that measured the perceived effect of diabetes on daily functioning.""

Explanation: The primary outcome directly measures the patient's perceived daily functioning, which is relevant and important to patients. This makes it pragmatic.

Score: [4]

Primary analysis:

Relevant quotes:

""Analyses were performed on an intention-to-treat basis.""

""Only 16 of the 117 patients in the intervention arm (14%) who were found eligible by the posted research-driven screening questionnaire were detected by their practice nurses."" 

Explanation: The analysis was done on an intention-to-treat basis, which is pragmatic. However, the low exposure to the actual intervention for many patients in the intervention arm reduces pragmatism. Overall this makes the analysis moderately pragmatic.

722,9,4,5,5,5,5,5,4,5,5,"Here are the PRECIS-2 scores for the clinical trial paper ""722.pdf"":

Eligibility criteria

Relevant quotes:

""Patients ≥ 18 years of age with established CVD or an estimated five-year CVD risk of ≥15%...were eligible.""

""Each participant had to have, in their doctor’s view, indications for all and no contraindications to any component of at least one of two polypills...""

The eligibility criteria seem fairly broad, including adults with either established CVD or high estimated CVD risk. The main exclusions are contraindications to the polypill components, which seems pragmatic as these patients likely wouldn't receive the polypill in usual care. However, there is some uncertainty around how patients were determined to be ""high risk"" beyond the CVD risk calculator. Overall, the criteria appear more pragmatic than explanatory.

Score: [4] 

Recruitment:

Relevant quotes:

""Central, computer-based randomization to polypill-based strategy or usual care was stratified by primary healthcare centre, type of indication (established CVD versus high risk), Indigenous identification and level of preventive treatment at baseline.""

""All participants were treated by their regular doctor following randomization.""

The patients seem to have been recruited through their regular primary care doctors, without extra recruitment efforts like media campaigns or incentives. The recruitment path matches how patients would access this intervention under usual care conditions.

Score: [5]

Setting:

Relevant quotes:

""We conducted a randomized, open-label trial involving 623 participants from Australian general practices.""

""Rural and remote communities included to ensure that ‘real-life’ variations in healthcare delivery were captured.""  

The trial was conducted in a range of general practice settings across Australia, including rural and remote areas. This diversity of real-world settings matches where the intervention would be delivered under usual care.

Score: [5]

Organisation:

Relevant quotes:

""Prescription and dispensing of the polypill occurred in the same way as for other medications.""

""This mostly involved doctors providing patients with written prescriptions, and patients presenting the prescriptions to designated local pharmacies where all drugs (including the polypill) were dispensed.""

The polypill was prescribed and dispensed through the existing healthcare system, similar to other medications. There is no mention of extra staffing, training, or resources to deliver the intervention. The organization matches usual care.

Score: [5] 

Flexibility of experimental intervention - delivery:

Relevant quotes:

""Those allocated to the polypill-based strategy were prescribed one of the polypill versions at the discretion of their doctor, to be taken at a time suggested by the doctor."" 

""The doctor could, at any time, change prescription to the alternative polypill version, add drugs on top of the polypill, or withdraw the polypill and substitute individual drugs of their choice.""

The doctors had flexibility in terms of which polypill version to prescribe, when patients should take it, and ability to modify/change the polypill over time. There was no strict protocol dictating delivery. This matches the flexibility expected under usual care.

Score: [5]

Flexibility of experimental intervention - adherence:

Relevant quotes: 

No discussion of measures to enforce adherence.

There is no mention of monitoring or enforcing adherence. Patients seem to have been free to take the polypill as in usual care.

Score: [5] 

Follow-up:

Relevant quotes:

""Participants attended the primary healthcare centres for trial assessments at randomization and 12 month intervals thereafter. All participants were also reviewed one month post-randomization and at intervening six month intervals, but these could be conducted by telephone.""

Follow-up included visits at 12 months and phone calls at 1 month and 6 months. This does not seem substantially more intensive than typical follow-up for high CVD risk patients.

Score: [4]

Primary outcome:

Relevant quotes:

""Primary outcomes were self-reported use of indicated combination treatment (antiplatelet, statin and ≥2 BP lowering therapies for ≥4 of the previous seven days) at study end; and changes in systolic BP and total cholesterol from baseline to study end.""

The primary outcomes are clinically meaningful to patients - medication adherence, blood pressure, and cholesterol. They do not require special tests beyond what is typical in usual care.

Score: [5] 

Primary analysis:

Relevant quotes:

No mention of exclusions from primary analysis.

In the absence of any stated exclusions, the analysis approach seems to have been a standard intention-to-treat analysis.

648,9,4,NA,5,NA,5,NA,4,4,5,"Here are the PRECIS-2 scores I would give for the CORONIS trial based on the attached publication:

Eligibility criteria 
Relevant quotes:
""Pregnant women were eligible if they were to undergo delivery by lower segment caesarean section through a transverse abdominal incision, irrespective of fever in labour, gestational age, or multiple pregnancies.""
""Women were not eligible if there was a clear indication for a particular surgical technique or material to be used that prevented any of the allocated interventions being used, if they had more than one previous caesarean section, or if they had already been recruited into the trial.""

Reasoning: The eligibility criteria are quite broad, including women undergoing both elective and emergency cesarean section, at any gestational age, and with singleton or multiple pregnancies. The only notable exclusions are women with more than one previous cesarean section and those with a clear indication for a particular surgical technique. Overall, the criteria seem intended to achieve a study population that is representative of the target population for cesarean section in general.

Score: [4] Rather pragmatic

Recruitment 
Relevant quotes: No details provided on recruitment process.

Reasoning: Since no information is provided on how participants were recruited, I cannot assess this domain.

Score: [NA]

Setting
Relevant quotes: 
""CORONIS was undertaken at 19 sites in Argentina, Chile, Ghana, India, Kenya, Pakistan, and Sudan.""

Reasoning: The trial was conducted across multiple sites in 7 countries across 3 continents. This indicates that the setting is intended to be generalizable and applicable across diverse geographic regions and healthcare systems.

Score: [5] Very pragmatic

Organization
Relevant quotes: No details provided on organization of care delivery.

Reasoning: No information is provided on the expertise of care providers or resources available, so I cannot assess whether the organization differed from usual care.

Score: [NA] 

Flexibility: Delivery
Relevant quotes: No quotes, but the Methods section states ""All non-allocated surgical elements and all other aspects of the caesarean section procedure were undertaken at the discretion of the surgeon.""

Reasoning: Letting surgeons use their own discretion in how to deliver the allocated interventions suggests a very flexible approach that should mirror usual care.

Score: [5] Very pragmatic

Flexibility: Adherence
Relevant quotes: No details provided on measures to ensure adherence.

Reasoning: No information is provided on whether any measures were used to enforce or monitor adherence, so I cannot assess this domain.

Score: [NA]

Follow-up 
Relevant quotes:
""Data were collected at trial entry, immediately after surgery, at hospital discharge (including hospital transfer or death), and at about 6 weeks after delivery.""

Reasoning: Follow-up to 6 weeks post-delivery seems to represent the typical duration of follow-up after a cesarean section in usual care. No details are provided to suggest the frequency or intensity of measurement was increased beyond typical care.

Score: [4] Rather pragmatic

Primary outcome
Relevant quotes:
""The primary outcome was a composite of death, maternal infectious morbidity, further operative procedures, or blood transfusion (>1 unit) up to the 6-week follow-up visit.""

Reasoning: The components of the primary composite outcome are clinically important events that would be meaningful to patients and providers. The 6-week time period also seems reasonable and relevant.

Score: [4] Rather pragmatic

Primary analysis
Relevant quotes:
""Women were analysed in the groups into which they were allocated.""

Reasoning: Analyzing participants according to the group they were randomized to, regardless of adherence, represents an intention-to-treat approach that is very pragmatic.

Eligibility criteria

Quotes:
- ""Inclusion criteria: diagnosis of MS made by a neurologist, able to walk 10 meters with or without an aid within 2 minutes, no relapse of their MS in the past 4 weeks, and no other neurological or orthopedic condition that would affect their function.""
- ""Eligible participants were excluded from the study if they were already engaged in a formal exercise program lasting >30 minutes twice per week, experienced an exacerbation within the past 4 weeks, had their MS immunomodulation medications altered in the previous 4 weeks or during the trial period, or declined to be randomly allocated.""

Explanation: The eligibility criteria are moderately pragmatic. Patients had to have a confirmed diagnosis of MS and be able to walk at least 10 meters, which are reasonable criteria for a walking exercise intervention trial. However, excluding patients who were already exercising regularly, had a recent exacerbation or medication change, or declined randomization make the criteria less pragmatic. Overall, this domain seems moderately pragmatic but leaning towards the explanatory side. Score: [3]

Recruitment 
Quotes:
- ""Community dwelling people with MS were recruited through the Multiple Sclerosis Society of New South Wales and South Australia.""

Explanation: Recruitment was done through a MS society, which seems moderately pragmatic as people with MS who might be interested in an exercise program are members of such societies. However, recruiting only through a society may bias the sample compared to broad recruitment from clinical settings. There is not enough information to determine if any additional effort beyond contacting society members was made. Score: [3]

Setting
Quote: 
- ""The group program was conducted at a local community center and included four to six participants per class.""

Explanation: The setting was a local community center, which seems pragmatic as this matches real-world settings where group exercise classes are held. No mention is made of using specialized or academic centers. Score: [4] 

Organization
Quote:
- ""Groups were led by a physiotherapist employed by the Multiple Sclerosis Society who received training to ensure a standard approach to intervention, intensity, and progression.""

Explanation: A physiotherapist led the groups, which seems reasonably pragmatic, although the additional training to standardize the interventiondelivery across sites makes it slightly less so. No major changes like increased staffing or resources were mentioned. Score: [4] 

Flexibility: delivery
Quote: 
- ""Guidelines were provided to physiotherapists and participants for exercises to be adapted and progressed to suit individual functional ability via increasing repetitions, amplitude of movement, speed of movement, and modifying base of support.""

Explanation: There was flexibility in how the exercises were delivered and progressed, tailored to each participant's functional level. No strict protocol was described. Score: [4]

Flexibility: adherence
Quote:
- ""In both group and home exercise sessions, participants completed eight, 6 minute exercises/stations per session plus a 5-minute warm up and cool down."" 

Explanation: Participants were expected to complete the full exercise program, but no specific measures to enforce adherence were mentioned. This seems moderately pragmatic. Score: [3]

Follow-up
Quotes:
- ""Outcome assessments were conducted at baseline, immediately post-intervention and at 8-week follow-up.""
- ""Assessments were conducted by physiotherapists blinded to group allocation and trained in administering the outcome measures.""

Explanation: Follow-up was at two standard time points with blinded outcome assessment. No unscheduled or more frequent visits were mentioned. This seems pragmatic. Score: [4]

Primary outcome
Quote:
- ""The primary outcome measure was gait speed, measured using the 10-meter walk test.""

Explanation: The primary outcome of gait speed is highly relevant and meaningful to patients. It was measured in a standard way that could be applied in real-world settings. Score: [5]

""Inclusion criteria for the study included (1) a diagnosis of MS, (2) not currently engaged in rehabilitation, therapy or PA program and able to undertake PA without risk-factors (3) aged between 18 and 65 (4) able to give informed consent and to understand French.""

Reasoning: The eligibility criteria are fairly inclusive, allowing adult MS patients with a range of disease severity and types to participate as long as they are not currently in a rehabilitation or PA program. Patients only needed to be able to undertake PA without risk factors, which is consistent with how PA would be recommended in clinical practice. The criteria do not appear to specifically select for patients expected to respond well to the intervention. The only major exclusion is due to language.

Quotes:
""The facilitator manual provides guidance on preparation and delivery, detailed session content, notes and suggested timings, and a checklist of facilitator objectives as well as signposts to additional resources. Sessions are delivered via PowerPoint; hence can be easily replicated. A companion participant handbook, along with existing information booklets, reinforces programme content.""

Reasoning: The intervention is manualized with PowerPoint slides, handouts, and guidance for facilitators. This reduces flexibility in delivery compared to usual care. However, no measures to monitor or enforce compliance are mentioned.

690,9,4,3,3,2,3,NA,2,4,5,"Here are the PRECIS-2 domain scores and justifications based on the provided full text:

Eligibility criteria

Relevant quotes:

""Participants were non-institutionalized adults (age ≥ 18 years) with severe MS and their primary carers.""

""Other patient inclusion criteria were primary or secondary progressive MS, [1,13] Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score ≥ 8.0, [14] complex symptoms, [15] and ≥2 unmet care needs."" 

""All patient-carer dyads gave written informed consent before study enrollment.""

Score: [4] Rather pragmatic

The eligibility criteria target the intended population for the intervention (severe MS patients and their caregivers) using criteria commonly used in MS research like EDSS score and type of MS. While restrictive, the criteria seem aligned with identifying patients who would need and receive this intervention in usual care. The inclusion of caregivers also matches usual care. The consent requirement is standard.

Recruitment

Relevant quotes:

""Dyads were randomly assigned (2:1) to receive HPA or UC. Allocation to treatment groups was done using a third-party, web-based computerized randomization procedure with stratified minimization for EDSS score (8.0–8.5, 9.0–9.5), presence of severe cognitive compromise (clinical judgment), and center""

Score: [3] Equally pragmatic and explanatory 

The recruitment through minimization randomization is more explanatory, since it tries to balance groups on selected factors. However, recruitment is from patients already engaged with the participating clinical centers, which is more pragmatic. Overall, recruitment has explanatory and pragmatic elements.

Setting

Relevant quotes:

""In this randomized, examiner-blind, controlled study, we recruited patients from three Italian centers."" 

Score: [3] Equally pragmatic and explanatory

Conducting the trial across 3 centers makes it more pragmatic and enhances generalizability. However, limiting to only 3 centers in Italy without further description makes it unclear how well the settings match real-world care settings. The setting has both pragmatic and explanatory elements.

Organization

Relevant quotes:

""Based on the principles of PC, each center had a HPA team consisting of a physician (neurologist or physiatrist), a nurse (case manager and team leader), a psychologist, and a social worker.""

""The nurse (team leader) performed 152 visits (33%), followed by the psychologist (25%), the physician (25%), and the social worker (17%).""

Score: [2] Rather explanatory 

The HPA team brings additional expertise and resources beyond usual care for MS patients. The involvement of multiple specialists for home visits is not reflective of typical care. The organization is skewed toward being more explanatory.

Flexibility: Delivery

Relevant quotes:

""After a comprehensive assessment of the dyad needs based on direct observation and on visit 1 information (available via the eCRF), the HPA team defined the contents of the intervention, involving the dyad and the patient caring physician (the intervention was not intended to replace existing services).""

Score: [3] Equally pragmatic and explanatory

The delivery allows for some flexibility in tailoring to each dyad's needs, which is more pragmatic. However, it is protocolized with comprehensive assessment and eCRF documentation. The delivery has explanatory and pragmatic aspects.

Flexibility: Adherence

Relevant quotes:

No relevant quotes.

Score: [NA] 

The text does not provide enough information to assess flexibility of adherence.

Follow-up

Relevant quotes:  

""All team activities were recorded in the PeNSAMI patient study record, which was kept at the patient’s home and available to all HPs/caregivers.""

""Dyads assigned to UC received the three examiner visits (visits 1–3) and the monthly telephone interviews, but not the HPA team visits (except visit 0).""

Score: [2] Rather explanatory

The HPA team visits and detailed documentation in study records constitute more intensive follow-up than usual care. The additional examiner visits and monthly calls for the UC group also make follow-up more explanatory.

Primary Outcome

Relevant quotes:

""The pre-specified primary endpoints were changes in patient quality of life (SEIQoL-DW) and symptom burden (PC Outcome Scale-Symptoms-MS, POS-S-MS).""

Score: [4] Rather pragmatic 

The quality of life and symptom measures seem patient-centered and relevant for evaluating a palliative care intervention. The outcomes are meaningful for patients.

Primary Analysis

Relevant quotes:

""All randomly assigned patients were included in the main intention-to-treat analysis, provided that at least one contact with the team occurred (HPA group).""

Score: [5] Very pragmatic

The analysis used an intention-to-treat approach including all randomized patients with at least one contact. This data analysis matches usual care and is very pragmatic.

The eligibility criteria are reasonably inclusive, allowing a range of disability levels and only excluding those with very recent exacerbations or other medical conditions that would prevent exercise. The confirmed MS diagnosis and cognitive screening are pragmatic given the nature of the intervention. Overall, the criteria seem intended to get a representative sample of the target population.

Score: [4] 

Recruitment
Quotes: 
""Potential participants (n 1⁄4 159) were sent invitation letters and participant information sheets."" 

""Thus 36 people were invited for screening.""

Recruitment was done by contacting potential participants from a clinical register and inviting them to participate. There was no mention of advertising or other special efforts beyond invitation letters. This seems like a reasonably pragmatic approach.

Score: [4]

Setting
Quotes:
""The intervention took place at two different geographical locations (Site A and Site B).""

""From those living near Site A a list of potential participants (n 1⁄4 16) was created and, to maximise class occupancy, 10 potential participants were allocated to Site A’s intervention group. A similar system was used for Site B (which had a class capacity of 12), for which a list of potential participants (n 1⁄4 20) was created.""

The classes took place in two community leisure centers, which seems like a very pragmatic setting for an exercise intervention intended for community implementation.

Score: [5] 

Organization
Quotes:
""Each group was led by two instructors (one physiotherapist and one fitness instructor)."" 

""The same physiotherapist was present at both sites; however fitness instructors were different between sites.""

The classes were led by a physiotherapist and fitness instructor, which seems like a reasonably pragmatic level of expertise for delivering an exercise intervention in the community. There is no mention of additional resources or training beyond what would be typical.

Score: [4]

Flexibility: delivery
Quotes:
""Through discussion with the instructors, participants chose which level of each exercise they deemed appropriate and also when and how each exercise should be progressed.""

Eligibility criteria

Quotes:
- ""For inclusion and exclusion criteria, see Langeskov-Christensen et al24""
- ""At inclusion, a neurologist examined participants to determine the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score, unless a recent score (<6 months) followed by a disease stable period existed.""

Reasoning: The eligibility criteria seem fairly broad, including people with any MS subtype as long as they have a recent stable EDSS score. The only major exclusions seem to be significant comorbidities and inability to exercise. This matches usual care pretty closely.

Score: [4] 

Recruitment

Quotes: 
- ""Eighty-six participants were recruited from Danish MS clinics (Aarhus University Hospital, Viborg Regional Hospital, Odense University Hospital, and the MS Clinic of Southern Jutland (Kolding)).""

Reasoning: Participants were recruited when they attended standard clinic appointments at multiple centers. No extra efforts like advertising seem to have been used. This matches usual care.

Score: [5]

Setting

Quotes:
- ""Eighty-six participants were recruited from Danish MS clinics (Aarhus University Hospital, Viborg Regional Hospital, Odense University Hospital, and the MS Clinic of Southern Jutland (Kolding)).""

Reasoning: The trial was conducted at standard MS clinics where patients receive usual care. No specialized or single-center settings were used.

Score: [5] 

Organization

Quotes:
- ""Supervised PAE sessions were conducted twice weekly during the 24 weeks, with one continuous and one interval exercise session performed each week.""

Reasoning: The intervention was delivered by study staff during supervised sessions twice per week. This provides more resources and monitoring than would occur in usual care.

Score: [2]

Flexibility: Delivery

Quotes:
- ""In brief, the session volume increased from 30 to 60 minutes during the intervention while the intensity increased from 65% to 95% of individual maximum heart rate (HRmax)."" 
- ""For further details on exercise modality options and the progressing volume and intensity of the exercise sessions, see Langeskov-Christensen et al.23""

Reasoning: The exercise intervention followed a standardized protocol with set progression of duration and intensity. This leaves little flexibility in how it is delivered compared to usual care.

Score: [2]

Flexibility: Adherence

Quotes: 
- No discussion of measures to enforce adherence

Reasoning: There is no mention of monitoring or enforcing patient adherence to the exercise program. This matches the flexibility expected in usual care.

The eligibility criteria seem reasonably inclusive, excluding only patients with comorbid psychiatric disorders that could confound the results. However, patients had to be definitely diagnosed with MS and have records at the MS Society to participate. This may exclude some MS patients who are not engaged with the Society. Overall, the criteria seem moderately pragmatic.

Score: [3] 

Recruitment

Relevant quotes:
""Because the patients were not hospitalized and regularly referred to the Association, to follow randomized assignment, we decided to run the sampling within two consecutive months until we enrolled an adequate number of participants. Accordingly, 70 numbers, equal to the number of people required in each group, were developed and the numbers 1e70 were randomly assigned to two groups: experimental and control. After eligible patients referred to the Association, a number was randomly assigned to each patient according to his/her referring time and the patients were assigned to the two groups.""

Patients were recruited as they presented to the MS Society clinic over 2 months. No extra effort beyond usual clinic recruitment was mentioned. This seems quite pragmatic.

Score: [4] 

Setting

1. ""CDTs were given during three consecutive days in Zorghotel Spelderholt, Beekbergen, the Netherlands, a facility especially equipped for the accommodation of people with impaired health.""

2. The intervention was delivered at a specialized facility for people with impaired health. This is more explanatory than a typical outpatient setting.

Score: [2]

Organization

1. ""The multidisciplinary team included a psychiatrist, psychiatric nurse, neurologist, registered nurse specialized in MS, physiotherapist, dance therapist, and a person with MS.""

2. The intervention required a specialized multidisciplinary team including medical specialists, nurses, therapists and a patient expert. This level of resources and expertise exceeds what would be available in usual care.

Score: [2]

Flexibility (delivery)

1. ""Components are large group sessions, small group sessions, consultations (carrousel), a theatre evening, and start of the day with a joint activity (optional)"" 

2. The delivery protocol seems reasonably fixed, with pre-defined components delivered in a structured program. This reduces flexibility compared to usual care.

Score: [3]

Flexibility (adherence)

1. No mention of specific measures to enforce adherence.

2. Adherence does not seem to be directly enforced or monitored. This matches usual care.

Score: [5] 

Follow-up

If include visually impaired increase organisation of trial (as in carers have to assist diary completion) but that would be norm and usual if prescribed ibuprofen or Paracetemol or steam treatment in usual care, so just easier for trialists to exclude. Small proportion of participants – so why exclude? Depressed and people with psychosis unreliable diary fillers, concerned with other things.""

Reasoning: The eligibility criteria mostly match patients who would receive this treatment in usual care, with some typical exclusions like pregnant women. However, the exclusions of visually impaired, depressed, and psychotic patients seem overly restrictive compared to usual care. Overall quite pragmatic but some limitations.

Score: [4] 

Recruitment

Quotes: 
""Patients presenting to GP or nurse in primary care with respiratory tract infections as diagnosed by health professional. Easy to recruit to but time pressures in busy winter clinics prevented recruitment and meant non-recruitments logs poorly completed.""

Score: [NA]

Flexibility: Adherence 

No relevant quotes

Explanation: The paper does not mention any strategies to enforce or monitor adherence. However, it also provides no details to suggest flexibility in adherence.

Score: [NA]

Follow-up

Quotes:
- ""Blinded raters performed EDSS assessments at baseline, every 3 months, and when relapse was suspected.""  
- ""Raters administered the MSFC 3 times before baseline to attenuate practice effects, then every 6 months.""

Explanation: Patients were followed regularly with assessments every 3 months for EDSS and every 6 months for MSFC. This seems moderately frequent but not excessive compared to real-world practice.

Score: [3]

Primary outcome

Quote: ""EDSS-based and non-EDSS-based methods. The results of these prespecified outcomes and post hoc analyses from CARE-MS II more fully characterize the effects of alemtuzumab on disability in patients with RRMS than those published previously""

Explanation: The primary outcomes include EDSS and MSFC which measure disability and are clinically meaningful to patients.

Score: [5] 

Primary analysis

Quote: ""An intention-to-treat analysis has recently also become the norm for superiority trials taking a more explanatory design approach, especially when regulatory approval for an intervention is being sought.""

Eligibility criteria 
Quotes: 
1) ""Eligible participants were over 18 years of age and had a diagnosis of MS that was confirmed by a consultant physician or neurologist.""
2) ""Persons with MS were excluded if they had a previous relapse or began steroid therapy in the 12 weeks prior to participating in the first assessment, were pregnant, or had a comorbidity that severely impacted their ability to safely participate in exercise.""

Reasoning: The eligibility criteria are reasonably broad, including adults with confirmed MS diagnosis. Some exclusions are made for safety reasons like recent relapse, pregnancy, and comorbidities impacting exercise safety. Overall, the criteria seem moderately pragmatic.

Score: [3]

Recruitment
Quotes:
1) ""Participants were referred to the project by themselves, their care-giver, MSI, chartered physiotherapists, neurologists, general practitioners or clinical nurse specialists."" 
2) ""Once consent for eight people of a strand in a specific geographical area was obtained, the regional office of MSI contacted the national coordinator (AL) who allocated that block of participants to the control or an intervention.""

Reasoning: Participants were recruited through usual care referrals from physicians and self-referrals. The recruitment seems moderately pragmatic overall, leveraging usual care routes but with some extra coordination for grouping and randomization.

Score: [3] 

Setting
Quote: ""This was a multi-centre, block randomised, assessor blind, controlled study. The methods of the trial were previously described in detail. This paper presents the results of the study participants, who used at the most unilateral support to walk outdoors""

Reasoning: The trial was conducted across multiple centers, suggesting a pragmatic setting close to usual care.

Score: [4]

Organization
Quote: ""All interventions took place in groups of eight, for an hour per week, for 10 weeks. They were delivered in community centres such as local gyms, hotels and health centres.""

Reasoning: The interventions were delivered in community settings using existing resources, suggesting a pragmatic organization.

Score: [4] 

Flexibility: delivery
Quotes:
1) ""The PT-led exercise provided was pre-defined. It consisted of a circuit-style class of exercises that were either resisted by body weight or by the addition of free weights.""
2) ""The yoga intervention was also not predefined, and detailed descriptions of the classes were gathered by nine of the instructors.""

Reasoning: The PT-led intervention was protocolized while the yoga intervention was flexible. Overall, the delivery seems moderately pragmatic.

Score: [3]

Flexibility: adherence
No relevant quotes.

Reasoning: The text does not mention any measures to enforce adherence. I will assume a pragmatic approach was taken since nothing is specified.

Score: [4] 

Follow-up
Quote: ""Outcome was assessed at week 24 for the intervention groups only, as it was felt that withholding a potentially beneficial treatment for longer than 12 weeks, from the controls, could be considered unethical. As all groups were not treated similarly between weeks 12 and 24, and due to the high attrition rates at weeks 12 and 24, the results of our follow-up phase will be presented in a separate paper.""

Reasoning: Follow-up was limited to 12 weeks even for the control group to avoid withholding treatment. This seems reasonably pragmatic.

Score: [4]

Primary outcome
Quotes: 
1) ""The primary outcome measure was the physical component of the Multiple Sclerosis Impact Scale-29, version 2 (MSIS-29v2), a patient-reported outcome measure that assesses the physical impact of MS.""
2) ""It consists of 20 questions and it is scored from 0–100, with the higher scores indicating a greater impact of MS.""

Reasoning: The primary outcome is a patient-reported measure of MS physical impact, which seems highly pragmatic and relevant to participants.

But even asthma patients who were not sensitive to ibuprofen or aspirin eligible. Pregnant or breast feeding women are discouraged from taking ibuprofen when pregnant but can take as low a dose as possible of Paracetemol but as both being tested in the trial cannot include this group as participants. If include visually impaired increase organisation of trial (as in carers have to assist diary completion) but that would be norm and usual if prescribed ibuprofen or Paracetemol or steam treatment in usual care, so just easier for trialists to exclude. Small proportion of participants – so why exclude?""

Reasoning: The eligibility criteria are quite broad, including patients with acute respiratory tract infections who would receive the intervention in usual care. Some common exclusions are made for safety reasons or to simplify trial procedures, but overall the criteria seem pragmatic.

Score: [4]

Recruitment

Quotes:

""Patients presenting to GP or nurse in primary care with respiratory tract infections as diagnosed by health professional. Easy to recruit to but time pressures in busy winter clinics prevented recruitment and meant non-recruitments logs poorly completed.""

Reasoning: Patients were recruited through usual appointments in primary care, which is a very pragmatic approach. Some non-recruitment due to time pressures indicates that recruitment conditions were similar to real-world constraints.

Score: [5] 

Setting

Quotes:

""Identical setting to usual care setting: primary care, where patients usually go for advice and treatment of the common cold in the UK.""

""Multi-centre: 25 practices in UK.""

Reasoning: The setting of primary care clinics is identical to where patients would receive treatment in usual practice. Multiple sites were used to increase generalizability.

Score: [5]

Organization

Quotes: 

""Information sheets given out to participants. This is not usual practice, would it be if trial had shown this helped? Need more staff for follow up of trial participants to get diary results so more extensive data collection than usual. Otherwise no difference in provider expertise and organisation of care delivery.""

Reasoning: The intervention was delivered with existing primary care staff and resources. Some additional materials and data collection were required for the trial but unlikely to affect care delivery.

Score: [4]

Flexibility: Delivery

Quotes:

""Full flexibility""

Reasoning: No protocol prescribed how providers should deliver the intervention, indicating full flexibility.

Score: [5]

Flexibility: Adherence

Quotes:

""Compliance measured with diary – “reasonably good” participants free to “not-comply” with advice. Little impact of advising patients to take analgesics regularly. No measures to improve compliance""

Reasoning: Adherence was measured but participants were free to follow the advice or not. No special measures were used to enforce adherence.

Score: [5]

Follow-Up

Quotes:

""Participants Followed up one month – usual care no follow up. Patients come back to GP if problems. Trial more extensive data colleaction - patients telephoned day two to three to check for any problems with diary completion. If no diary after 2 weeks then mailed reminder and then phoned as necessary to document outcomes using validated questionnaire.""

Reasoning: One month follow-up is more than usual care. Additional contacts were made to collect trial data but unlikely to affect care.

Score: [3]

Primary Outcome

Quotes:

""Very relevant to participants - Mean symptom severity on days 2-4. Symptoms 0 (no problem) to 6 (as bad as they can be 7 in abstract). Completed in diary at end of day – children with parents or participants.""

670,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,"Here are the PRECIS-2 domain scores and explanations for the trial in the attached paper ""670.pdf"":

Eligibility:

Relevant quotes:

""The inclusion criterion for the study was a diagnosis of multiple sclerosis, and therefore the spectrum of clinical presentations was broad, as would be expected in this client population.""

""Of the fifteen study participants, all had previously received a diagnosis of multiple sclerosis. The time since diagnosis ranged from three to forty-one years (with a mean of 19 years) at the time of the study. Nine participants were categorized as Relapse eRemitting, four as Secondary Progressive and two as Primary Progressive."" 

""With respect to the ambulatory status of the participants, six walked unassisted, five used a cane, and four used a walker. All participants had prior experience of massage treatment at the clinic.""

Reasoning: The inclusion criterion of a diagnosis of MS is very broad and appears to match usual care eligibility. The participants represented a range of MS types and disability levels, reflecting a heterogeneous MS population typically seen in practice. The broad eligibility criteria yield a pragmatic trial design aimed at determining effectiveness under usual conditions.

Score: [5]

Recruitment:

Relevant quotes:

""Clients attending the clinic were interviewed, and their case histories recorded. The research project was explained, and written informed consent was obtained.""

""An appropriate history and physical examination was performed, and a treatment plan determined, this being reflective of the therapist’s assessment and the mutually set goals for the treatment series."" 

Reasoning: Participants were recruited when they attended the clinic for usual care, which matches how they would receive this intervention under normal circumstances. No additional effort was made to recruit beyond those presenting for care.

Score: [5] 

Setting:

Relevant quotes:

""Participants were clients seen in the multiple sclerosis clinics at Sutherland-Chan School, in which the study was conducted.""

""Clients were provided with information about the clinic by the local chapter of the Multiple Sclerosis Society, and self selected on that basis.""

Reasoning: The setting was a multiple sclerosis specialty clinic, which appears to be the typical setting where these patients receive massage therapy. Conducting the trial in this real-world clinical setting matches the intended application.

Score: [5]

Organisation:

Relevant quotes: 

""The teacher also monitored treatment delivery, which involved the application of a variety of techniques appropriate to the client’s needs. These included effleurage, petrissage, stroking, frictions, vibrations, tapotment, rocking and shaking, details of which have been reviewed by Yates (2004). These techniques all involve the manipulation of soft tissues to which was added joint mobilization, myofascial techniques, rehabilitative exercise and hydrotherapy in order to reflect the broad therapeutic armamentarium of the massage therapist.""

Reasoning: The massage therapy was delivered by supervised student therapists using typical resources and a variety of techniques tailored to each participant's needs. This matches how massage therapy is organized and provided in real-world practice.

Score: [5]

Flexibility (delivery): 

Relevant quotes:

""Massage therapy is aligned with the wellness paradigm of health and health care (Alexander, 2006; Yates, 2004), which speaks to a holistic client centered approach to treatment. Accordingly, if the current research was to conform to the requirements of model fit/ecological validity (Menard, 2003; Mason et al., 2002), it was incumbent on the therapists to construct individualized treatment plans recognizing the importance of the client’s physical, psychological and emotional needs. The heterogeneity of the client/participant population precluded an overly prescriptive approach to treatment, and it is worth noting that this heterogeneity is also a component of the normal clinical reality of therapists involved with multiple sclerosis clients.""

Reasoning: The massage therapy was individualized for each participant based on presenting symptoms and tailored goals. No protocol was prescribed, allowing flexibility to match real-world practice.

Score: [5]

Flexibility (adherence):

Relevant quotes: None relevant.

Reasoning: The paper does not mention any strategies to enforce or monitor adherence. In the absence of information, it appears there was no difference from usual care.

Score: [5] 

Follow-up:

Relevant quotes:

""For both treatment and control groups, self-efficacy scores were obtained before the first treatment, mid-treatment series, after the last treatment in the series, four weeks after the final treatment and again eight weeks after the final treatment had been received.""

Reasoning: Follow-up was limited to 5 assessment time points to measure the primary outcome. This does not seem more extensive than usual care.

Score: [5]

Primary outcome:

Relevant quotes:

""The outcome measures for the current research were the scores yielded by the Multiple Sclerosis Self Efficacy (MSSE) survey.""

""The nature of the MSSE survey is such that the clients’ self-efficacy rating is captured through a series of eighteen questions to which they respond on a scale ranging from ten to one hundred. The instrument focuses on the clients’ perception of their ability to function, and the degree of control they have within the context of their disease state."" 

""In the context presented above, the use of MSSE scores as the outcome measure in the current research reflects the notion that massage therapy has the potential to improve client well-being and adjustment to living with multiple sclerosis, through improving perceptions of function and control.""

Reasoning: The primary outcome was self-efficacy measured by the MSSE survey, which assessses patients' perceived ability to function and degree of control. This outcome is relevant and meaningful to the participants.

Score: [5]

Primary analysis:

Relevant quotes:

""The data were analyzed on an intention to treat basis, with a focus on the differences between mean MSSE values of the control and intervention groups.""

Reasoning: An intention-to-treat analysis was used including all participants as randomized. This pragmatic approach to analysis matches the intended purpose.

""Where appropriate, participants also performed exercises for strength and control. The prescribed strength training was based on individual functional needs, as assessed by the trial physiotherapist (NS).""

Reasoning: The supervised exercise sessions took place at a university exercise research facility with supervision from an exercise physiologist and physiotherapist input. This specialized setting is more explanatory than a typical clinical setting where exercise would be prescribed. However, the program was designed to be pragmatic and tailored to individual needs.

Score: [3] Equally pragmatic and explanatory

Organization: 

Relevant quotes:
""An exercise physiologist supervised the delivery of the intervention but with physiotherapist input during the early stages of the programme.""

Reasoning: The intervention involved supervision from an exercise physiologist and physiotherapist, which provides more resources and expertise than may be typically available in usual care. However, it does not seem that extensive additional training or experience was required.

Score: [3] Equally pragmatic and explanatory

Flexibility - Delivery:

Relevant quotes:  
""Aerobic exercise was the core exercise modality as it is accessible (i.e. includes community-based walking exercise) and does not require equipment. Participants were asked to complete short bouts (e.g. 5 × 3 minutes, with two-minute rest intervals) of low to moderate intensity aerobic exercise (e.g. stepping ergometer, cycle-ergometer, treadmill walking, rowing ergometer, arm-cranking) at 50%–69% of predicted maximum heart rate (220–age) or 12–14 on the Borg Ratings of Perceived Exertion Scale.""

""The home-exercise sessions were intended to mirror the supervised sessions in terms of intensity and duration of aerobic exercise, and also included tailored exercises for strength, flexibility and balance. Participants were encouraged to seek out opportunities to exercise in the local community (e.g. healthy living centres, health walks, fitness centres, swimming pools, etc.), based on their individual preferences.""

Reasoning: The protocol provides guidance on the exercise intensity, duration, and modalities but leaves flexibility for individually tailored programs incorporating community-based activities. This seems reasonably similar to what would be done in usual care.

Score: [4] Rather pragmatic

Flexibility - Adherence:

Relevant quotes: No discussion of measures to enforce adherence.

Reasoning: There is no indication that measures were in place to monitor or enforce adherence. Participants seemed to have flexibility similar to what would occur in usual care.

Score: [5] Very pragmatic

Follow-up:

Relevant quotes: 
""Outcomes were assessed at baseline, and at three months (post-intervention) and nine months after randomisation.""

Reasoning: Outcomes were assessed at baseline, 3 months, and 9 months. There is no mention of extra visits or more extensive follow-up than would occur in usual care.

Score: [4] Rather pragmatic

Primary outcome:

Relevant quotes:
""The primary outcome was self-reported exercise behaviour at three months using the Godin Leisure Time Exercise Questionnaire (GLTEQ).""

Reasoning: The primary outcome was self-reported exercise behavior, which is a patient-centered outcome that would be relevant in usual care. The GLTEQ seems like a reasonable tool to assess this.

Score: [4] Rather pragmatic

Primary analysis:

Relevant quotes:
""All analyses were by intention to treat, whereby participants were analysed in the arm to which they were randomised irrespective of whether they complied with the intervention."" 

Reasoning: An intention-to-treat analysis was used, which is consistent with a pragmatic approach.

Eligibility criteria

Quotes:
""Inclusion criteria were: age of 18 years or above; BDI score of at least 14 on two consecutive occasions and no treatment from psychologist, psychotherapist or psychiatrist within the last three months.""

""Exclusion criteria were: poor English language skills or cognitive function (score of less than 24 on Mini Mental State Examination [20]); BDI score of at least 29 on two consecutive occasions; active suicidal ideas; current or life-time diagnosis of psychosis, organic mental disorder or substance dependency; Kurtzke Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score of 8.5 or above [21]."" 

The trial had strict inclusion and exclusion criteria that excluded patients based on English proficiency, cognitive impairment, suicidal ideation, psychosis, organic mental disorders, substance dependency, and high levels of disability. This reduces the similarity of trial participants to real-world patients and limits generalizability. The exclusion of patients with severe depression (BDI ≥29) also departs from real-world practice.

Recruitment

Quotes:
""Invitations were made between October 2008 and July 2009: face-to-face by consultants in the Sheffield Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust MS clinic (n = 288); by the Sheffield MS nurses visiting patients (n = 4); and, using ink-signed personalised letters mailed out from a neuropsychologist at Sheffield (n = 40) as well as from consultant neurologists at the Walton Centre for Neurology and Neurosurgery NHS Trust, Liverpool (n = 250).""

""Sheffield neurologists in the MS clinic, forms were completed and returned by 63 (21.8%) candidates from which we randomised 13 in 281 days (4.5% recruitment yield), or 1.4 participants per month. From the 250 recruitment packs sent out by post from The Walton Centre, forms were completed and returned by 64 (25.6%) of recipients, from which 10 participants were randomised in 149 days (4.0% recruitment yield), or two participants per month.""

The trial used multiple recruitment strategies including in-clinic recruitment and mailed letters. The overall recruitment rate was low, with only 4.1% of those invited consenting to participate. The additional effort required beyond standard clinical practice reduces pragmatism.

Organisation

Quote:
""In the Sheffield region, Primary Care Trust (PCT) mental health care teams administered the CCBT, facilitating access and undertaking safety monitoring (PCTs were publicly funded organisations responsible for commissioning acute services for local populations). The CCBT service provided to trial participants was the routine service provided to all patients referred to the PCT mental health care teams.""

The CCBT intervention was delivered through existing PCT mental health care teams, reflecting usual care organization and resources.

Score: [4] Rather pragmatic

Flexibility: delivery

Quote: 
""Only one out of the five participating PCTs around the Sheffield centre formally provided any kind of community facility for accessing CCBT; PCT staff warned that clients rarely used the facility and it was closed during the course of the study. Although four out of five participating PCTs were happy to arrange alternative provision for those who did not have Internet access at home, all our participants requested home use of CCBT. In the Liverpool region, a specialist neuropsychologist, based in the acute hospital facilitated access to and provided technical advice on CCBT, but did not provide additional therapeutic input.""

The CCBT intervention was delivered with flexibility, allowing home access as preferred by participants. There was no strict protocol dictating delivery.

Score: [4] Rather pragmatic

Flexibility: adherence 

No relevant quotes. The paper does not mention any measures to enforce or monitor adherence. As an unguided self-administered intervention, flexibility of adherence appears high.

Score: [4] Rather pragmatic

Follow-up

Quotes:
""The completion of outcome data by postal questionnaire proved to be challenging, with multiple attempts to obtain data from many participants, particularly at later outcome assessment points.""

""Participants were contacted if they failed to keep trial appointments.""

The trial used postal questionnaires for follow-up assessment, which required significant additional effort beyond usual care. Participants were contacted if they missed appointments, also indicating more intensive follow-up.

Score: [2] Rather explanatory

Primary outcome

Quote:
""The primary clinical endpoint was the mean change in self-reported symptoms of depression as measured on the BDI. Specifically, we measured the mean change in scores between the two arms as measured at baseline, 8 and 21 weeks (13 weeks post intervention).""

The primary outcome was change in BDI score, a standard depression scale. This outcome is clinically meaningful and important to patients.

666,9,3,3,4,3,4,4,3,5,5,"Here are the PRECIS-2 scores for the clinical trial based on the attached publication:

Eligibility criteria

Quotes:
- ""Key inclusion criteria permitted the participation of men or women ≥18 years of age with confirmed and documented RRMS diagnosis (as defined by the Revised McDonald criteria)""
- ""Key exclusion criteria were previous exposure to GA40, a progressive form of MS or neuromyelitis optica, the use of experimental or investigational drugs, participation in clinical drug studies within the 6 months before screening, recent use of immunosuppressive medications or immunoglobulins/monoclonal antibodies, or previous use of alemtuzumab, cladribine, cyclophosphamide, or mitoxantrone.""

The eligibility criteria are typical for an RRMS trial, excluding progressive forms of MS and severely disabled patients. The key inclusion criterion is a confirmed RRMS diagnosis. The trial excludes patients who have previously been exposed to GA40, likely to avoid bias, but does not exclude based on expected adherence or response. Overall, the criteria seem moderately pragmatic.

Score: [3]

Recruitment:

Quotes: 
- ""Eligible patients were randomly assigned 1:1 to receive subcutaneous injections of GA40 (n = 431) or GA20 (n = 430).""

No details are provided on how patients were recruited into the trial. However, since patients were randomized after being screened for eligibility, it seems that patients were recruited in a reasonably standard way, likely from MS clinics. There is no mention of extra efforts like media campaigns or incentives.

Score: [3] 

Setting:

Quotes:
- ""The CONFIDENCE study was a multinational, multicenter, randomized, parallel-group, phase 4, open-label study conducted at 88 study centers in 14 countries (Russia, Poland, Italy, France, Croatia, US [including Puerto Rico], Mexico, Spain, Austria, Turkey, Belgium, Argentina, Germany, and Finland) across different geographic regions.""

The trial was conducted across 88 centers in 14 countries across several continents. This diversity of settings indicates a pragmatic approach to increase generalizability of results.

Score: [4]

Organization: 

No relevant quotes.

There are no details provided on resources, staffing, or intervention delivery. It seems the trial did not make significant changes to normal care delivery.

Score: [3]

Flexibility (delivery):

No relevant quotes.

No details are provided on how the interventions were delivered. However, since this was a trial comparing two approved dosage regimens of an existing therapy, it is likely the flexibility in delivery mirrored real-world practice.

Score: [4]

Flexibility (adherence):

Quotes:
- ""Adherence to treatment when the dosing schedule differs is complicated, because missing one dose has potentially differential impacts on treatment.""

Adherence was measured through self-reported questionnaires. No measures were taken to enforce adherence. This pragmatic approach mirrors real-world practice.

Score: [4]

Follow-up:

Quotes:
- ""Five scheduled visits at study sites occurred at screening (within 2 weeks prior to baseline), baseline (Month 0), and Months 1, 3, and 6 (end of the core phase)."" 
- ""Patients also participated in self-reported, daily at-home MSQ assessments on Days 1 through 7 after the baseline visit.""

Follow-up included 5 scheduled visits over 6 months, which is reasonably frequent but not excessive. Additional patient-reported outcomes were collected daily for the first week. Follow-up intensity seems slightly greater than normal care but still moderately pragmatic.

Score: [3]

Primary outcome:

Quotes:
- ""The primary endpoint was patient overall satisfaction with the medication as measured by the single-item MSQ 7-point scale (1 = extremely dissatisfied to 7 = extremely satisfied)""

The primary outcome is patient satisfaction measured by the MSQ scale. This outcome is clinically meaningful and patient-centered.

Score: [5] 

Primary analysis:

Quotes:
- ""The intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis set included all randomly assigned participants and were analyzed according to the treatment group to which they were randomly assigned, regardless of which treatment they actually received.""

An intention-to-treat analysis was used including all randomized patients. This pragmatic approach is appropriate for a superiority trial.

668,9,4,4,5,5,5,5,4,5,5,"Here are the PRECIS-2 scores for the trial based on the full text:

Eligibility criteria 

Relevant quotes:

""Volunteers were excluded if they had an acute exacerbation of MS within 2 months of starting the program, had benign or progressive/relapsing types of MS, had a serious unstable medical condition, had any concurrent condition, for example stroke, or had participated in a PRT program in the 6 months before training started.""

""Participants were recruited through a statewide organization providing education and support to people with MS, and a large specialist MS outpatient clinic. To be included, people had to be aged 18 years or more, have a confirmed diagnosis of relapsing–remitting MS, have an Ambulation Index score of 2, 3 or 4 (mild to moderate walking disabilities), and have received medical clearance to participate.""

Reasoning: The eligibility criteria mostly match those who would receive this intervention in usual care, including adults with confirmed relapsing-remitting MS and mild to moderate walking disability. However, some exclusion criteria like recent acute exacerbation and participation in PRT in past 6 months make it slightly less pragmatic. Overall, it seems reasonably close to usual care eligibility.

Score: [4] Rather pragmatic

Recruitment

Relevant quotes:

""Recruitment information flyers were sent by mail to all potential participants registered on the mailing lists of both organizations. If interested, volunteers were asked to contact one of the researchers (KD) by telephone, during which volunteers were screened to ensure they satisfied the inclusion criteria.""

Reasoning: Recruitment was done through organizations providing education and support to people with MS, by sending flyers to their mailing lists. This seems reasonably close to how patients would be recruited or made aware of the intervention in a real-world setting. No major additional efforts like media campaigns or incentives were mentioned.

Score: [4] Rather pragmatic  

Setting

Relevant quotes:

""The experimental group completed a 10-week (two times per week), PRT program in one of four community gymnasiums in metropolitan and regional areas.""

Reasoning: The setting of community gymnasiums seems very typical of where patients would receive this intervention in usual care. Multiple sites were used which further enhances pragmatism.

Score: [5] Very pragmatic

Organization

Relevant quotes:

""Each program was attended by a group of up to 12 participants, and they were supervised by up to three experienced trainers (physiotherapists and registered personal sports trainers). Each trainer directly supervised a sub-group of three or four participants.""

""The training also took the form of small group-based training; this is important because it made exercising a more social activity, and it was more cost effective and time efficient than individual training."" 

Reasoning: The intervention utilized trainers with expertise typical of a real-world setting - physiotherapists and personal trainers. Resources were not substantially greater than usual care. Overall organization seems very similar to real-world implementation.

Score: [5] Very pragmatic

Flexibility of experimental intervention - delivery

Relevant quotes:

""While these were the core exercises, they could be individualized. For example, if any exercise caused discomfort, the starting position was modified or the exercise was replaced.""

Reasoning: There was flexibility in delivery of the exercises based on individual needs and tolerances. No major protocol constraints were mentioned. This matches real-world flexibility.

Score: [5] Very pragmatic

Flexibility of experimental intervention - adherence

Relevant quotes:

No relevant quotes found.

Reasoning: There is no mention of any special measures to enforce or monitor adherence. It seems to match usual encouragement.

Score: [5] Very pragmatic

Follow-up

Relevant quotes:  

""Outcome measurements were taken three times: at baseline, after 10 weeks to determine the immediate effects of the intervention, and after a further 12 weeks (week 22) to determine if any benefits from the program had been sustained.""

Reasoning: Follow-up at 10 weeks and 22 weeks seems reasonably typical to assess sustainability of outcomes. No mentions of more extensive unscheduled visits or data collection. 

Score: [4] Rather pragmatic

Primary outcome

Relevant quotes:

""Changes in walking endurance were measured with the 2-minute walk test (2MWT).""

""Changes in maximal walking speed were measured by recording the time taken to walk the middle 10 m of a level 14-m walkway using a stopwatch.""

Reasoning: The primary outcomes of walking endurance and speed are highly relevant for MS patients and measure skills needed in daily life. They do not require special expertise to assess.

Score: [5] Very pragmatic

Primary analysis

Relevant quotes:

""Intention-to-treat analysis was applied, with all participants who were allocated and commenced their program included in analysis. Where data were missing, the carry forward technique was used.""
