How to use PRECIS-2 - Designing trials that are fit for purpose
We think there are four steps to using PRECIS-2, which may be iterative depending on what you
discover after going through the steps.
Step 1: Why are you doing your trial?
Your first step is to be clear about why you are doing your trial. Are you:
1. Aiming to take an explanatory approach to answer the question ‘Can this
intervention work under ideal conditions?’
2. Aiming to take a pragmatic approach and answer the question ‘Does this
intervention work under usual conditions?’
Both approaches to trial design have their place but trialists should be clear which path they are on.
As Schwartz and Lellouch pointed out, trialists have often taken the first approach by default rather
than as a considered judgement.
Step 2: Consider your trial design choices for each of the nine PRECIS-2 domains
This step is explained in more detail for each domain later on.
Step 3: Score 1 to 5 for these choices made in Step 2 and/or mark on the PRECIS-2 wheel
Having considered your design choices in Step 2, the PRECIS-2 wheel is used to record how
pragmatic or explanatory these choices are for each domain. Each domain is a 5-point Likert scale:
1. Very explanatory
2. Rather explanatory
3. Equally pragmatic/explanatory
4. Rather pragmatic
5. Very pragmatic
A table can be used in conjunction with the PRECIS “wheel” or instead of the wheel to give rationale
for scores. You can use this to assist discussion with trial collaborators.
Step 4: Review your PRECIS-2 wheel
Review your design choices (Step 2) on the PRECIS-2 wheel to see whether they will produce a trial
that will support the aim identified in Step 1. Go back to Step 2 and modify your design choices if
required.

The PRECIS-2 Domains
The NINE PRECIS-2 domains are:
 Eligibility –to what extent are the participants in the trial similar to those who would receive this
intervention if it was part of usual care? For example, score 5 for very pragmatic criteria
essentially identical to those in usual care; score 1 for a very explanatory approach with lots of
exclusions (e.g. those who don’t comply, respond to treatment, or are not at high risk for
primary outcome, are children or elderly), or uses many selection tests not used in usual care.
 Recruitment - how much extra effort is made to recruit participants over and above what that
would be used in the usual care setting to engage with patients? For example, score 5 for very
pragmatic recruitment through usual appointments or clinic; score 1 for a very explanatory
approach with targeted invitation letters, advertising in newspapers, radio plus incentives and
other routes that would not be used in usual care.
 Setting – how different is the setting of the trial and the usual care setting? For example, score 5
for a very pragmatic choice using identical settings to usual care; score 1, for a very explanatory
approach with only a single centre, or only specialised trial or academic centres.
 Organisation – how different are the resources, provider expertise and the organisation of care
delivery in the intervention arm of the trial and those available in usual care? For example, score
5 for a very pragmatic choice that uses identical organisation to usual care; score 1 for a very
explanatory approach if the trial increases staff levels, gives additional training, require more
than usual experience or certification and increase resources.
 Flexibility (delivery) – how different is the flexibility in how the intervention is delivered and the
flexibility likely in usual care? For example, score 5 for a very pragmatic choice with identical
flexibility to usual care; score 1 for a very explanatory approach if there is a strict protocol,
monitoring and measures to improve compliance, with specific advice on allowed co-
interventions and complications.
 Flexibility (adherence) - how different is the flexibility in how participants must adhere to the
intervention and the flexibility likely in usual care? For example, score 5 for a very pragmatic
choice involving no more than usual encouragement to adhere to the intervention; score 1 for a
very explanatory approach that involves exclusion based on adherence, and measures to
improve adherence if found wanting. In some trials eg surgical trials where patients are being
operated on or Intensive Care Unit trials where patients are being given IV drug therapy, this
domain is not applicable as there is no compliance issue after consent has been given, so this
score should be left blank.
 Follow-up - how different is the intensity of measurement and follow-up of participants in the
trial and the likely follow-up in usual care? For example, score 5 for a very pragmatic approach
with no more than usual follow up; score 1 for a very explanatory approach with more frequent,
longer visits, unscheduled visits triggered by primary outcome event or intervening event, and
more extensive data collection.
 Primary outcome – to what extent is the trial's primary outcome relevant to participants? For
example, score 5 for a very pragmatic choice where the outcome is of obvious importance to
participants; score 1 for a very explanatory approach using a surrogate, physiological outcome,
central adjudication or use assessment expertise that is not available in usual care, or the
outcome is measured at an earlier time than in usual care.
 Primary analysis – to what extent are all data included in the analysis of the primary outcome?
For example, score 5 for a very pragmatic approach using intention to treat with all available
data; score 1 for a very explanatory analysis that excludes ineligible post-randomisation
participants, includes only completers or those following the treatment protocol.

Notes
“Participants" include patients or other individual recipients of an intervention, and/or providers of
the intervention. This may include individual participants and/or one or more levels of clusters. For
example, in a trial of a continuing education intervention, participants may be health professionals
and trained instructors and the trial may be randomised into clusters at the level of the instructor.
During the design process, if there is uncertainty over how explanatory or pragmatic a domain is,
then we suggest the score for this domain should be left blank. This will then highlight uncertainty
and encourage discussion. If PRECIS-2 is used to look at how pragmatic included trials are in
systematic reviews then a score of 3 may be chosen if there is inadequate information. This is
different to the “3 = equally pragmatic/explanatory”.

Table – PRECIS-2 scores for trial domains
Domain Score Rationale
1 Eligibility Criteria 5 
Patients ≥ 3 with acute respiratory tract infections. Exclusions not common cold but severe respiratory tract infections,
peptic ulcer and asthma. But even asthma patients who were not sensitive to ibuprofen or aspirin eligible. Pregnant or
breast feeding women are discouraged from taking ibuprofen when pregnant but can take as low a dose as possible of
Paracetemol but as both being tested in the trial cannot include this group as participants. If include visually impaired
increase organisation of trial (as in carers have to assist diary completion) but that would be norm and usual if
prescribed ibuprofen or Paracetemol or steam treatment in usual care, so just easier for trialists to exclude. Small
proportion of participants – so why exclude? Depressed and people with psychosis unreliable diary fillers, concerned
with other things.
2 Recruitment Path 5 
Patients presenting to GP or nurse in primary care with respiratory tract infections as diagnosed by health professional.
Easy to recruit to but time pressures in busy winter clinics prevented recruitment and meant non-recruitments logs
poorly completed.
3 Setting 5 Identical setting to usual care setting - primary care where patients usually go for advice and treatment.
4 
Organisation
intervention
3 
Information sheets given out to participants. This is not usual practice, would it be if trial had shown this helped? Need
more staff for follow up of trial participants to get diary results so more extensive data collection than usual. Otherwise
no difference in provider expertise and organisation of care delivery.

Compliance measured with diary – “reasonably good” participants free to “not-comply” with advice. Little impact of
advising patients to take analgesics regularly. No measures to improve compliance
7 Follow up 2 Participants Followed up one month – usual care no follow up. Patients come back to GP if problems.
Trial more extensive data colleaction - patients telephoned day two to three to check for any problems with diary
completion. If no diary after 2 weeks then mailed reminder and then phoned as necessary to document outcomes using
validated questionnaire.
8 Outcome 5 
Very relevant to participants - Mean symptom severity on days 2-4. Symptoms 0 (no problem) to 6 (as bad as they can
be 7 in abstract). Completed in diary at end of day – children with parents or participants.
9 Analysis 5 ITT no matter whether compliance.
