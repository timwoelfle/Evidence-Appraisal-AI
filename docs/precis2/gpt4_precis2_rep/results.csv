- Quote: ""Participants were included who scored >2 on the General Health Questionnaire 12, a measure of psychological distress, or >7 on the anxiety and depression subscales of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, thus confirming they had low mood.""
- Reasoning: The eligibility criteria for this trial are quite specific, requiring participants to have a certain score on two different psychological distress scales. This suggests that the trial is not including all individuals with multiple sclerosis, but rather a subset of these individuals who also have low mood. This is less pragmatic as it does not reflect the full range of individuals who might receive this intervention in a usual care setting.
- Score: [2]

2. Recruitment
- Quote: ""Participants were recruited for a randomized trial of adjustment groups for people with multiple sclerosis and low mood between June 2008 and September 2009.""
- Reasoning: The text does not provide specific details about how participants were recruited, such as whether they were recruited from a usual care setting or through other means. Without this information, it is difficult to assess the pragmatism of the recruitment process.
- Score: [NA]

3. Setting
- Quote: ""The groups were delivered by two Band 5 assistant psychologists, who were supervised by a Band 8a clinical psychologist, experienced in working with people with multiple sclerosis.""

- Score: [2]

5. Flexibility (delivery)
- Quote: ""Participants allocated to intervention were invited to attend a psychological adjustment group for six sessions over 12 weeks.""
- Reasoning: The intervention is delivered in a structured manner with a set number of sessions over a specific period of time. This level of rigidity in the delivery of the intervention suggests a more explanatory approach.
- Score: [2]

6. Flexibility (adherence)
- Quote: ""Those allocated to intervention were invited to attend a psychological adjustment group for six sessions over 12 weeks.""
- Reasoning: The text does not provide specific information about measures in place to ensure participants adhere to the intervention. However, the structured nature of the intervention suggests that there may be less flexibility for participants in terms of adherence.
- Score: [NA]

7. Follow-up
- Quote: ""Four and eight months after random allocation, participants were sent a booklet of outcome questionnaires to complete and return by post.""
- Reasoning: The follow-up process involves sending participants questionnaires at specific time points, which may not reflect the usual care setting. This suggests a more explanatory approach.

- Reasoning: The eligibility criteria for this trial are quite specific, including age, gender, diagnosis, and EDSS score. This suggests that the trial is not fully pragmatic as it does not include all individuals who might receive the intervention in a real-world setting. However, the criteria are not overly restrictive and do not exclude individuals based on factors such as adherence or responsiveness to the intervention.
- Score: [3]

2. Recruitment
- Quote: ""Patients have been recruited at Ferrara University Hospital from patients who attend the Rehabilitation Outpatient Clinic for gait rehabilitation.""
- Reasoning: The recruitment process is somewhat pragmatic as it involves recruiting patients from a rehabilitation outpatient clinic, which is a usual care setting. However, the recruitment is limited to a single hospital, which may not fully represent the diversity of patients in the real world.
- Score: [3]

3. Setting
- Quote: ""Eligible patients have been randomized to 10 supervised TOCT sessions over two weeks (Phase 1) followed by a 12-weeks home-based task-oriented program (Phase 2) or a delayed-treatment group.""
- Reasoning: The trial setting includes both a supervised setting (the hospital) and a home-based setting, which is a pragmatic approach as it reflects the settings in which the intervention would likely be applied in the real world. However, the trial is conducted in a single hospital, which may limit the generalizability of the results.

- Score: [5]

6. Flexibility (adherence)
- Quote: ""A mean adherence of 6.2 out of 10 was reported for the home-based TOCT program.""
- Reasoning: The trial allows for some flexibility in adherence, as evidenced by the reported adherence rate. This is a pragmatic approach as it reflects the variability in adherence that would likely be seen in the real world.
- Score: [5]

7. Follow-up
- Quote: ""The blind evaluator, who did not supervise the training program, performed functional tests, questionnaires and instrumental measurements the week before treatment, the week after the end of the supervised-TOCT, after the 12-weeks home-based TOCT program.""
- Reasoning: The follow-up in this trial is more intensive than would typically occur in usual care, with multiple assessments conducted by a blind evaluator. This suggests a more explanatory approach.
- Score: [2]

8. Primary outcome
- Quote: ""The primary outcome measure was the 6-minute walking test (6MWT) for walking endurance.""

- ""Participants were encouraged to keep a diary of home practice, but, in fact, very few did record it.""

Reasoning: The intervention was delivered in a structured manner with specific activities and homework assignments. However, there was some flexibility in that participants were not strictly required to keep a diary of home practice. This suggests a balance between explanatory and pragmatic approaches.

Score: [3]

6. Flexibility (adherence)

Quotes:
- ""Eighteen of the 19 participants completed the mindfulness intervention.""
- ""All the participants attended four or more of the eight mindfulness sessions and 14 (73.7%) attended six or more sessions.""

Reasoning: The trial allowed for some flexibility in adherence, as evidenced by the fact that not all participants attended all sessions. This suggests a more pragmatic approach.

Score: [4]

7. Follow-up

Quotes:
- ""Participants completed online questionnaires at baseline (prior to randomisation), post-intervention and three-month follow-up.""
- ""If participants had failed to complete the questionnaires a week later, SW phoned them to ensure that they had received the email and that they were not encountering any technical difficulties.""

Reasoning: The follow-up process involved online questionnaires at specific time points, with additional contact if participants failed to complete the questionnaires. This level of follow-up is more intensive than what would typically occur in usual care.

Score: [2]

8. Primary outcome

Quotes:
- ""The primary outcome was distress, as measured by GHQ.""
- ""Distress scores were lower in the intervention group compared with the control group at post-intervention and follow-up.""

Reasoning: The primary outcome of distress is relevant to participants and is measured in a way that is similar to how it would be measured in usual care. This suggests a more pragmatic approach.

Score: [4]

9. Primary analysis

Quotes:
- ""Outcome analysis was conducted using Stata 12.1.""
- ""Treatment effects on the primary and secondary outcomes were estimated using linear mixed modelling.""

Reasoning: The primary analysis included all available data and used statistical methods that are commonly used in clinical trials. This suggests a balance between explanatory and pragmatic approaches.

Score: [3]","1. Eligibility criteria

Quotes:
- ""Inclusion criteria were diagnosis of PPMS or SPMS, Internet access and some level of distress determined by a score of 3 or greater on the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12).""
- ""Exclusion criteria were severe cognitive impairment, as determined by a score of 20 or smaller on the Telephone Interview for Cognitive Status-Modified (TICS-M), and high suicide risk, as assessed by a score of 20 or greater on the Clinical Outcome of Routine Evaluation (CORE-10).""

Reasoning: The eligibility criteria for this trial are quite specific, including a diagnosis of PPMS or SPMS, internet access, and a certain level of distress. Additionally, individuals with severe cognitive impairment or high suicide risk were excluded. These criteria may limit the generalizability of the trial results to the broader population of individuals with MS, as they exclude those without internet access or with cognitive impairments or high suicide risk.

Score: [2]

2. Recruitment

Quotes:
- ""We recruited 40 participants across the UK.""
- ""We recruited potential participants through adverts on the MS Society website and from National Health Service (NHS) MS centres across the UK.""

Reasoning: The recruitment process involved advertising on the MS Society website and through NHS MS centres, which may not reflect the usual care setting where patients are typically identified and approached for interventions. This approach may limit the generalizability of the trial results to the broader population of individuals with MS.

Score: [2]

3. Setting

Quotes:
- ""The treatment phase took place between February 2013 and July 2013.""
- ""We delivered the programme in eight hour-long sessions over an eight-week period via Skype video conferences.""

Reasoning: The trial was conducted via Skype video conferences, which is not a typical care setting. This may limit the generalizability of the trial results to the broader population of individuals with MS, particularly those without access to or familiarity with Skype.

Score: [2]

4. Organisation

Quotes:
- ""AB, a health psychologist, facilitated the courses. AB was supervised by PC, a clinical psychologist and expert mindfulness practitioner.""
- ""Participants were sent a headset and webcam together with instructions of how to set up Skype.""

Reasoning: The trial required specific resources (headset, webcam, Skype setup instructions) and expertise (health psychologist, clinical psychologist) that may not be readily available in a usual care setting. This may limit the generalizability of the trial results to the broader population of individuals with MS.

- ""Participants had a confirmed diagnosis of multiple sclerosis, an Extended Disability Status Scale score of 5 (ambulatory without aid or rest for about 200 m) to 6.5 (constant bilateral assistance required to walk about 20 m without resting), stable rehabilitation and drug therapy for 30 days before entry into the study, cognitive scores of over 24 on the Mini-Mental State Examination and access to the intervention sites using their own or public transport.""
- ""Potential participants were excluded if they had experienced exacerbation of their multiple sclerosis symptoms three months prior to the study, or had any medical condition which may preclude them from taking part in the exercise intervention.""

Reasoning: The eligibility criteria for this trial are quite specific, including a confirmed diagnosis of multiple sclerosis, a certain range of disability scores, stable rehabilitation and drug therapy, and access to the intervention sites. This suggests that the trial is not fully representative of the broader population of individuals with multiple sclerosis, as it excludes those with more severe disabilities, those with unstable treatment regimens, and those without access to the intervention sites. 

Score: [2]

2. Recruitment:

Quotes:
- ""Of the 873 patients on the clinical register for multiple sclerosis 159 patients were deemed suitable for the study. These people were sent invitation letters and participant information sheets.""
- ""Forty-three potential participants expressed an interest in participating.""

Reasoning: The recruitment process involved identifying potential participants from a clinical register and sending them invitation letters and information sheets. This approach is somewhat pragmatic as it mimics the way patients might be informed about new treatment options in a usual care setting. However, it also involves an extra step of identifying suitable patients from a register, which may not be typical in usual care.

Score: [3]

3. Setting:

Quotes:
- ""The intervention took place at two different geographical locations (Site A and Site B).""
- ""This study was undertaken in two community leisure setting, this is one of the first studies to utilise this format and, as there is a trend toward longer term rehabilitation and symptom management in the community in the UK, the results of this study are timely.""

Reasoning: The trial was conducted in two community leisure settings, which is a pragmatic choice as it reflects a real-world setting where the intervention might be implemented. This suggests that the trial results could be applicable to similar settings in the usual care context.

Score: [5]

4. Organisation:

Quotes:
- ""Each group was led by two instructors (one physiotherapist and one fitness instructor). The same physiotherapist was present at both sites; however fitness instructors were different between sites.""
- ""Participants were provided with exercise progress cards and were asked to record which level they performed each exercise at each session.""

Reasoning: The organisation of the trial intervention involved a team of two instructors (a physiotherapist and a fitness instructor) at each site, and participants were asked to record their exercise progress. This level of organisation and monitoring is more intensive than what might be expected in usual care, suggesting a more explanatory approach.

Score: [2]

5. Flexibility (delivery):

Quotes:
- ""Through discussion with the instructors, participants chose which level of each exercise they deemed appropriate and also when and how each exercise should be progressed.""
- ""Participants worked at a self-regulated pace for each exercise.""

Reasoning: The trial allowed for a high degree of flexibility in the delivery of the intervention, with participants able to choose the level of each exercise and work at their own pace. This reflects a pragmatic approach, as it mirrors the flexibility that would likely be present in a usual care setting.

Score: [5]

6. Flexibility (adherence):

Quotes:
- ""Including those who discontinued participation, the total attendance at the classes was 340 sessions out of a possible 480 (71%) with participants missing classes due to other appointments, family/work commitments, transport problems, holidays or mild ill-health (e.g. common cold).""

Reasoning: The trial allowed for flexibility in adherence, with participants able to miss classes due to other commitments or health issues. This is a pragmatic approach, as it reflects the realities of adherence in a usual care setting where individuals may not always be able to attend every session due to various life circumstances.

Score: [5]

7. Follow-up:

Quotes:
- ""Outcome measures were carried out within the local hospital’s rehabilitation unit. They were taken at baseline, after 8 and 12 weeks of the intervention period (i.e. either the exercise class or usual care).""

Reasoning: The follow-up in this trial involved taking outcome measures at baseline and after 8 and 12 weeks of the intervention. This is a relatively short follow-up period and the frequency of follow-up visits is not specified, making it difficult to assess the level of pragmatism in this domain.

Score: [NA]

8. Primary outcome:

Quotes:
- ""The primary outcome measure was 25-foot (7.6 m) walk time, secondary outcomes assessed walking endurance, balance, physical function, leg strength, body mass index, activity levels, fatigue, anxiety and depression, quality of life and goal attainment.""

Reasoning: The primary outcome of the trial, the 25-foot walk time, is a measure that is directly relevant to the participants' daily lives and would likely be of interest in a usual care setting. This suggests a pragmatic approach to the choice of primary outcome.

Score: [5]

9. Primary analysis:

Quotes:
- ""All outcome measures were analysed on the basis of intention to treat, with all variables summarized and comparisons made between groups and over time.""

4. Organisation

Quotes:
- ""The Hockey FIT pro- gram was delivered over 12 weekly, 90-min sessions by Hockey FIT coaches (coach to participant ratio 2:20) from the central research team.""
- ""In addition to the weekly in-person sessions, participants took part in an incremental pedometer-based walking program and they both set and tracked lifestyle prescriptions for PA (steps), exercise, and healthy eating.""

Reasoning: The organisation of the intervention required additional resources and expertise beyond what would typically be available in usual care, such as the involvement of Hockey FIT coaches and the use of a pedometer-based walking program. This suggests a more explanatory approach.

Score: [3]

5. Flexibility (delivery)

Quotes:
- ""Program sessions com- prised the following: 1) classroom-based teaching of behavior change techniques and simple information sharing on PA and healthy eating, delivered to encourage participant interaction and mutual learning, and 2) exercise sessions where men performed aerobic, strength, and flexibility exercises, incorporating their passion for hockey off the ice.""
- ""At the start of the program, more time was allocated to classroom education, but as the program progressed, more time was spent on group-based exercise.""

Reasoning: The delivery of the intervention was quite structured, with specific components and a progression from classroom education to group-based exercise. This suggests a more explanatory approach, as it may not reflect the variability and flexibility of intervention delivery in a real-world setting.

Score: [2]

6. Flexibility (adherence)

Quotes:
- ""For 12 wk (Hockey FIT active phase or control), there were no serious adverse events reported. Participants reporting any adverse event were numerically higher for intervention (11 (27.5%)) compared with those in the comparator group (1 (2.5%)); however, most adverse events (11/12) were musculoskeletal and only 2 (5%) were considered possibly or definitely related to the intervention.""
- ""When examining clinically significant weight loss of at least 5% (18), our results indicate that men participating in Hockey FIT were 10 times more likely to achieve this weight loss by 12 wk compared with the controls.""

Reasoning: The trial did not appear to have strict measures in place to ensure participant adherence to the intervention, suggesting a more pragmatic approach. The fact that most adverse events were not related to the intervention and that participants were able to achieve clinically significant weight loss suggests that adherence was not a major issue.

Score: [4]
