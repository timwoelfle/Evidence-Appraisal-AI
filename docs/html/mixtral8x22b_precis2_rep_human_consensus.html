1. Eligibility:
* Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Pregnant women were eligible if they were to undergo delivery by lower segment caesarean section through a transverse abdominal incision, irrespective of fever in labour, gestational age, or multiple pregnancies.&quot;</span>
* Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Women were not eligible if there was a clear indication for a particular surgical technique or material to be used that prevented any of the allocated interventions being used, if they had more than one previous caesarean section, or if they had already been recruited into the trial.&quot;</span>
* Reasoning: The trial included pregnant women who were to undergo a caesarean section through a transverse abdominal incision, regardless of fever in labor, gestational age, or multiple pregnancies. However, women were excluded if there was a clear indication for a specific surgical technique or material, if they had more than one previous caesarean section, or if they had already been recruited into the trial. This suggests that the trial had some exclusion criteria, but still aimed to include a broad range of participants.
* Score: [4]
1. Recruitment:
* Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Each participating site, advised by their research ethics committee, decided how to provide trial information to women and seek informed consent.&quot;</span>
* Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Information leaflets were made available, in appropriate languages, which explained the trial objectives, the process of trial entry, and follow-up.&quot;</span>
* Reasoning: The trial allowed each participating site to decide how to provide trial information and seek informed consent from women. Information leaflets were made available in appropriate languages, explaining the trial objectives, the process of trial entry, and follow-up. This suggests that the trial made an effort to recruit participants in a way that was similar to usual care.
* Score: [5]
1. Setting:
* Quote: <span title='Moderate quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 90.9%):

was undertaken at 19 sites in Argentina, Chile, Ghana, India, Kenya, Pakistan, and Sudan.' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ff9e81'>&quot;The trial was undertaken at 19 sites in Argentina, Chile, Ghana, India, Kenya, Pakistan, and Sudan.&quot;</span>
* Reasoning: The trial was conducted at 19 sites across seven countries, which suggests that the trial was conducted in a variety of settings that are likely to be representative of the settings in which caesarean sections are typically performed.
* Score: [5]
1. Organization:
* Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Each regional coordinator (one per country, except India, which was split into two regions) started and documented a training programme that ensured that surgeons operating within the trial were familiar with the techniques being compared before participating.&quot;</span>
* Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The procedures for blunt versus sharp abdominal entry were as follows. For sharp entry, the abdomen was entered using a scalpel to divide the abdominal skin. Each subsequent layer of the abdomen was then separately identified and divided using either a scalpel or scissors. In blunt entry, the abdomen was entered using a scalpel to divide the abdominal skin. The scalpel was then used to divide the fat and rectus sheath in the midline and the rectus sheath incision extended manually. The parietal peritoneum was then entered digitally and the defect enlarged manually.&quot;</span>
* Reasoning: The trial ensured that surgeons were familiar with the techniques being compared before participating in the trial. The procedures for blunt versus sharp abdominal entry were described in detail, suggesting that the trial aimed to standardize the procedures as much as possible. However, the trial did not provide information on the resources, provider expertise, and organization of care delivery in the intervention arm compared to usual care.
* Score: [NA]
1. Flexibility (delivery):
* Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;All non-allocated surgical elements and all other aspects of the caesarean section procedure were undertaken at the discretion of the surgeon. In particular, there were no restrictions on the type of suture material that could be used, and standard measures to achieve haemostasis were employed regardless of the allocated intervention.&quot;</span>
* Reasoning: The trial allowed surgeons to use their discretion in non-allocated surgical elements and other aspects of the caesarean section procedure. There were no restrictions on the type of suture material that could be used, and standard measures to achieve haemostasis were employed regardless of the allocated intervention. This suggests that the trial allowed for flexibility in the delivery of the intervention.
* Score: [5]
1. Flexibility (adherence):
* Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;All investigators, surgeons, and participants were unmasked to treatment allocation.&quot;</span>
* Reasoning: The trial did not provide information on the flexibility in how participants must adhere to the intervention and the flexibility likely in usual care. However, the trial did not involve any compliance issues after consent was given, as all participants were unmasked to treatment allocation.
* Score: [NA]
1. Follow-up:
* Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Data were collected at trial entry, immediately after surgery, at hospital discharge (including hospital transfer or death), and at about 6 weeks after delivery. Women who did not return at 6 weeks were located and interviewed by telephone or during a home visit.&quot;</span>
* Reasoning: The trial collected data at trial entry, immediately after surgery, at hospital discharge, and at about 6 weeks after delivery. Women who did not return at 6 weeks were located and interviewed by telephone or during a home visit. This suggests that the trial aimed to follow up with participants in a way that was similar to usual care.

publication full text</span> (mean similarity 100%)</i></p>
<pre>
1. Eligibility:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Patients with type 2 diabetes (n=264) selected by a self-administered questionnaire aimed at measuring emotional distress and diabetes-related reduced daily functioning.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial included patients with type 2 diabetes who were selected based on emotional distress and reduced daily functioning, which are common issues in usual care. This suggests that the trial participants are similar to those who would receive the intervention in usual care.

Score: [5]

1. Recruitment:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Patients were asked to return the completed questionnaire to the research centre and to give informed consent to be approached if they were found to be eligible for research follow-up measurements.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The recruitment process involved patients returning a questionnaire and providing informed consent, which is similar to usual care. However, the recruitment was driven by the research team, which may not reflect the usual care setting.

Score: [3]

1. Setting:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The study involved practice nurses (n=40) providing care to approximately 4000 patients with diabetes.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial was conducted in a primary care setting, which is the usual care setting for patients with diabetes. This suggests that the trial setting is similar to usual care.

Score: [5]

1. Organization:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Practice nurses in the intervention arm (n=19) were trained to integrate SMS into their routine consultations.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial involved training practice nurses to integrate SMS into their routine consultations, which is similar to usual care. However, the training may have increased staff levels or resources, which may not reflect usual care.

Score: [4]

1. Flexibility (delivery):
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;SMS included detection of patients with emotional distress and reduced daily functioning, and supporting them when needed through problem solving and reattribution techniques.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial allowed for flexibility in the delivery of the intervention, as practice nurses could use problem-solving and reattribution techniques to support patients with emotional distress and reduced daily functioning. This suggests that the trial allowed for flexibility in the delivery of the intervention, which is similar to usual care.

Score: [5]

1. Flexibility (adherence):
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Patients could use information from a diary in which they recorded symptoms, thoughts, worries, feelings, and behaviour.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial allowed for flexibility in adherence, as patients could use a diary to record symptoms, thoughts, worries, feelings, and behaviour. This suggests that the trial allowed for flexibility in adherence, which is similar to usual care.

Score: [5]

1. Follow-up:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Outcomes were measured at baseline and at 4-month and 12-month follow-ups.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial involved follow-up measurements at 4 and 12 months, which is similar to usual care. However, the follow-up measurements may have been more frequent or extensive than usual care.

Score: [4]

1. Primary outcome:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The primary outcome measure was a dichotomised score on a Visual Analogue Scale that measured the perceived effect of diabetes on daily functioning.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The primary outcome measure was relevant to participants, as it measured the perceived effect of diabetes on daily functioning. This suggests that the trial's primary outcome was relevant to participants, which is similar to usual care.

Score: [5]

1. Primary analysis:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Multilevel analyses showed no significant differences in outcomes between the intervention and control arms.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial used multilevel analyses to compare outcomes between the intervention and control arms, which is similar to usual care. However, the trial did not report whether all data were included in the analysis of the primary outcome.

<pre>
1. Eligibility:
Quote: <span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 99.6%):

Eligible primary care patients 12 to 80 years of age had impaired asthmarelated quality of life (Mini Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire [MiniAQLQ] score ≤6) or inadequate asthma control (Asthma Control Questionnaire [ACQ] score ≥1).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;Eligible primary care patients 12 to 80 years of age had impaired asthma-related quality of life (Mini Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire [MiniAQLQ] score ≤6) or inadequate asthma control (Asthma Control Questionnaire [ACQ] score ≥1).&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial includes a broad range of patients with asthma-related quality of life impairment or inadequate asthma control, which is similar to the usual care population. The age range is also wide, including patients from 12 to 80 years old.

Score: [5]

1. Recruitment:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;We randomly assigned patients to 2 years of open-label therapy, under the care of their usual physician, with LTRA (148 patients) or an inhaled glucocorticoid (158 patients) in the first-line controller therapy trial and LTRA (170 patients) or LABA (182 patients) added to an inhaled glucocorticoid in the add-on therapy trial.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The recruitment process involves the patients' usual physicians, which is similar to the usual care setting. There is no mention of targeted invitation letters, advertising, or incentives to recruit participants.

Score: [5]

1. Setting:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The two trials, which were conducted at 53 primary care practices in the United Kingdom, enrolled patients 12 to 80 years of age with a physician’s diagnosis of asthma.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial was conducted in primary care practices, which is identical to the usual care setting for patients with asthma.

Score: [5]

1. Organization:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Practice staffs were asked to provide each patient with a written individualized asthma-action plan. For each of the assigned treatments, choices of individual drugs and devices were made according to normal clinical practice and British asthma guidelines.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial follows normal clinical practice and British asthma guidelines, which is similar to the usual care setting. There is no mention of additional staff, training, or resources beyond what is typically available in usual care.

Score: [5]

1. Flexibility (delivery):
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The protocol discouraged substantial treatment changes between randomization and the 2-month visit. If a patient required a disallowed asthma medication, this fact was noted, and the patient remained in the study.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial allows for some flexibility in treatment delivery, as patients can remain in the study even if they require a disallowed medication. However, the protocol discourages substantial treatment changes, which may limit flexibility compared to usual care.

Score: [3]

1. Flexibility (adherence):
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Patients who withdrew from the study continued to receive care from their usual clinician.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial allows patients to withdraw and continue receiving care from their usual clinician, which is similar to the usual care setting. There is no mention of measures to improve adherence if found wanting.

Score: [5]

1. Follow-up:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Clinical and lung-function data were recorded by clinic staff who were aware of the treatment assignments. Data collection and statistical analyses were performed by study personnel who were unaware of the treatment assignments; questionnaire-based data were collected under blinded conditions, and routine practice data (including a history of exacerbations) were extracted with the use of dedicated software.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial involves routine practice data collection and dedicated software for data extraction, which is similar to the usual care setting. However, the follow-up intensity may be higher than usual care due to the involvement of study personnel and clinic staff.

Score: [3]

1. Primary outcome:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The primary outcome measure was the MiniAQLQ score.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The primary outcome measure, MiniAQLQ score, is of obvious importance to participants, as it reflects their asthma-related quality of life.

Score: [5]

1. Primary analysis:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The primary effectiveness analysis was an intention-to-treat analysis of the MiniAQLQ score at 2 months (the primary time point) and at 2 years.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The primary analysis uses intention-to-treat with all available data, which is a pragmatic approach.

<pre>
1. Eligibility:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Patient selection criteria were having a diagnosis of moderate-to-severe COPD (a Body mass index, Airflow obstruction, dyspnoea and Exercise capacity [BODE] index score of 3–7) according to international guidelines&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial includes patients with moderate-to-severe COPD, which is a broad and common group of patients. The inclusion criteria are based on widely accepted international guidelines, making the trial more pragmatic. However, the use of the BODE index score as an inclusion criterion might limit the generalizability to patients with different disease severities.

Score: [4]

1. Recruitment:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Recruited patients (recruitment visit, −1) attended an initial 8-week outpatient-based PR programme conducted in each hospital rehabilitation department.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial recruits patients who have already attended an initial 8-week outpatient-based PR program, which suggests that the recruitment process is more pragmatic. However, the fact that patients are recruited from hospital rehabilitation departments might limit the generalizability to patients who do not attend such programs.

Score: [4]

1. Setting:
Quote: <span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 99.3%):

This was a multicentre open-label pragmatic parallel-group randomized clinical trial involving 13 hospitals and was conducted between 2014 and 2017' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;This was a multicentre open-label pragmatic parallel-group randomized clinical trial involving 13 hospitals and was conducted between 2014 and 2017.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial is conducted in multiple hospitals, which makes it more pragmatic. However, the fact that it is conducted in hospitals might limit the generalizability to patients who receive care in other settings.

Score: [4]

1. Organization:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Following completion of this programme, patients were randomly allocated (baseline visit, 0) to either the TelePR programme [intervention group (IG)] or the standard, usual care programme [control group (CG)].&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial compares a TelePR program to standard care, which suggests that the organization of care delivery is more pragmatic. However, the fact that patients are randomly allocated to either group might limit the generalizability to patients who are not randomly assigned to interventions.

Score: [4]

1. Flexibility (delivery):
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Patients in the IG were asked to continue at home with a similar training schedule to that completed in the hospital. They were provided with, for the 12-month follow-up period, a telerehabilitation kit (mobile phone, pulse oximeter, dumbbells and exercise bicycle) along with a user guide with detailed instructions on the use of the mobile device to deliver data collected to the web-based platform after completion of each scheduled session.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial allows for flexibility in the delivery of the intervention, as patients in the IG are asked to continue the training schedule at home and are provided with a telerehabilitation kit. However, the fact that patients are provided with detailed instructions on how to use the mobile device might limit the flexibility in the delivery of the intervention.

Score: [4]

1. Flexibility (adherence):
Quote: <span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 99.5%):

patient in the IG arm was classified as a non-complier if he/she did not perform scheduled exercises for at least 8 consecutive weeks, unless there were clear clinical reasons not to.' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;A patient in the IG arm was classified as a non-complier if he/she did not perform scheduled exercises for at least 8 consecutive weeks, unless there were clear clinical reasons not to.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial allows for flexibility in adherence, as patients in the IG are not excluded from the trial if they do not comply with the intervention for at least 8 consecutive weeks. However, the fact that patients are classified as non-compliers if they do not comply with the intervention might limit the flexibility in adherence.

Score: [4]

1. Follow-up:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;After the randomization visit, follow-up appointments were arranged for both groups at 3, 9 and 12 months. At each follow-up visit, the general health status of the patient was assessed, medical treatment was revised and optimized, educational reinforcement was provided, 6-minute walk test (6MWT) and spirometry tests were carried out and HRQoL measures were taken.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial includes regular follow-up appointments for both groups, which suggests that the intensity of measurement and follow-up is more pragmatic. However, the fact that patients are assessed at specific time points might limit the generalizability to patients who are not assessed at these time points.

Score: [4]

1. Primary outcome:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Exercise tolerance (the ability to sustain exercise) was assessed using distance covered in the 6MWT.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial uses a primary outcome that is relevant to patients, as exercise tolerance is an important outcome for patients with COPD. However, the fact that the trial uses a single primary outcome might limit the generalizability to patients who have different priorities.

Score: [5]

1. Primary analysis:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The main efficacy analysis used analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) techniques to test for differences between groups in outcome variables at the 12-month visit, adjusted for baseline values.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial uses an intention-to-treat analysis, which is a more pragmatic approach to data analysis. However, the fact that the trial uses ANCOVA techniques might limit the generalizability to trials that use different statistical methods.

<p><i><span style="border-bottom: 1px dashed black;">9 quote(s) from
publication full text</span> (mean similarity 100%)</i></p>
<pre>
1. Eligibility:
   - Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Eighty people with Expanded Disability Status scores of 1 to 6.5 participated in this trial.&quot;</span>
   - Reasoning: The trial included participants with a wide range of disability scores, which is representative of the usual care population.
   - Score: [5]

2. Recruitment:
   - Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Enrollment started in September 2015, and follow-up was completed in September 2016.&quot;</span>
   - Reasoning: The recruitment process took place over a year, which suggests a pragmatic approach to recruitment. However, the full text does not provide enough information on the recruitment methods used.
   - Score: [NA]

3. Setting:
   - Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The GroupCoreDIST intervention was conducted by 6 physical therapists in 6 municipalities in Norway.&quot;</span>
   - Reasoning: The intervention was conducted in multiple municipalities, which suggests a pragmatic approach to setting.
   - Score: [5]

4. Organization:
   - Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The physical therapists received a booklet with descriptions and photos of all exercises and variations, as well as the theoretical framework for the intervention.&quot;</span>
   - Reasoning: The physical therapists were provided with resources and training, which suggests an explanatory approach to organization.
   - Score: [1]

5. Flexibility (delivery):
   - Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The physical therapists individualized the exercises by tailoring them according to each individual’s symptoms, disability level, and general well-being, and they intensified the exercises by increasing number of repetitions, level of difficulty, and/or by adding motor-cognitive dual tasks as movement quality improved.&quot;</span>
   - Reasoning: The intervention allowed for flexibility in delivery, as the physical therapists could tailor the exercises to each individual's needs.
   - Score: [5]

6. Flexibility (adherence):
   - Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants in the intervention group were encouraged not to seek any physical therapy other than GroupCoreDIST during the 6 weeks of the intervention.&quot;</span>
   - Reasoning: The trial encouraged participants to adhere to the intervention, which suggests an explanatory approach to flexibility in adherence.
   - Score: [1]

7. Follow-up:
   - Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Assessments were undertaken at baseline and at weeks 7, 18, and 30.&quot;</span>
   - Reasoning: The trial had multiple follow-up assessments, which suggests a pragmatic approach to follow-up.
   - Score: [5]

8. Primary outcome:
   - Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Outcomes were measured with the Trunk Impairment Scale–Norwegian Version, Mini Balance Evaluation Systems Test, and Patient Global Impression of Change–Balance.&quot;</span>
   - Reasoning: The primary outcomes were relevant to participants, as they measured balance and trunk control, which are important for people with multiple sclerosis.
   - Score: [5]

9. Primary analysis:
   - Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;One individual missed all postintervention tests, leaving 79 participants in the intention-to-treat analysis.&quot;</span>
   - Reasoning: The trial used an intention-to-treat analysis, which suggests a pragmatic approach to primary analysis.
   - Score: [5]</pre>

<p><i><span style="border-bottom: 1px dashed black;">9 quote(s) from
publication full text</span> (mean similarity 100%)</i></p>
<pre>
1. Eligibility:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Inclusion criteria were diagnosis of PPMS or SPMS, Internet access and some level of distress determined by a score of 3 or greater on the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12).&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial includes participants with a diagnosis of PPMS or SPMS, which is a specific subgroup of MS patients. However, the requirement for Internet access and a minimum level of distress as determined by a standardized questionnaire suggests that the trial aims to include participants who are similar to those who would receive this intervention in usual care.

Score: [3]

1. Recruitment:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;We recruited potential participants through adverts on the MS Society website and from National Health Service (NHS) MS centres across the UK.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial recruited participants through a combination of online advertisements and NHS MS centers, which suggests a moderate level of effort to recruit participants. This approach is likely more pragmatic than targeted invitation letters or advertising in newspapers and radio, but less pragmatic than recruitment through usual appointments or clinic.

Score: [3]

1. Setting:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The treatment phase took place between February 2013 and July 2013. We delivered the programme in eight hour-long sessions over an eight-week period via Skype video conferences.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial was conducted using Skype video conferences, which is a virtual setting that is not identical to usual care. However, the use of Skype may be more pragmatic than a single center or specialized trial or academic centers, as it allows for remote participation and may be more accessible to participants.

Score: [3]

1. Organization:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants were sent a headset and webcam together with instructions of how to set up Skype.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial provided participants with equipment and instructions for using Skype, which suggests that additional resources were required beyond what is typically available in usual care. However, the use of Skype may be more pragmatic than increasing staff levels, providing additional training, or requiring more than usual experience or certification.

Score: [3]

1. Flexibility (delivery):
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The eight chapters, one for each session, introduced key mindfulness concepts, addressed issues common to progressive MS, and described homework for the week ahead.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial had a structured intervention with specific content and homework assignments, which suggests a moderate level of flexibility in delivery. However, the use of Skype may allow for more flexibility in terms of scheduling and location compared to in-person interventions.

Score: [3]

1. Flexibility (adherence):
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants were encouraged to keep a diary of home practice, but, in fact, very few did record it.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial encouraged participants to keep a diary of home practice, but did not strictly enforce adherence to the intervention. This suggests a moderate level of flexibility in terms of adherence.

Score: [3]

1. Follow-up:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants completed online questionnaires at baseline (prior to randomisation), post-intervention and three-month follow-up.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial had a follow-up period of three months with online questionnaires, which suggests a moderate level of intensity in measurement and follow-up. This is likely more pragmatic than more frequent or longer visits, unscheduled visits triggered by primary outcome event or intervening event, and more extensive data collection.

Score: [3]

1. Primary outcome:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The GHQ is designed to measure general levels of distress.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial used a standardized questionnaire to measure the primary outcome of distress, which is relevant to participants. However, the use of a surrogate outcome measure may be less pragmatic than using a clinical outcome measure.

Score: [3]

1. Primary analysis:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;We conducted all group comparisons on an intention-to-treat basis where we analysed participants in the group to which they were randomised.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial used an intention-to-treat analysis, which is a pragmatic approach that includes all available data. However, the trial did not explicitly state whether the analysis excluded ineligible post-randomisation participants or included only completers or those following the treatment protocol.

<p><i><span style="border-bottom: 1px dashed black;">10 quote(s) from
publication full text</span> (mean similarity 99.8%)</i></p>
<pre>
1. Eligibility:
* Quote 1: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The inclusion criteria were as follows: age > 18, confirmed diagnosis of MS, Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS): 2.0–6.5, Six Spot Step Test (SSST) score > 8 seconds or Timed 25-Foot Walk (T25FW) > 5 seconds, relapse-free within the past 8 weeks, and no adjustment of disease-modifying medication or medication that affects gait performance and spasticity within the past 8 weeks.&quot;</span>
* Quote 2: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Exclusion criteria were as follows: co-morbidity in terms of cognitive disorders or alcohol abuse (based on clinical judgment), pathologies that did not allow systematic PRT >1 session/week within the last 3 months.&quot;</span>
* Reasoning: The trial has a specific set of inclusion and exclusion criteria, including age, diagnosis, disability status, and recent medication changes. However, the criteria are not overly restrictive and allow for a range of participants with varying levels of disability. The exclusion criteria are also limited to those that would directly impact the intervention or outcomes.
* Score: [3]
1. Recruitment:
* Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants were included from September 2016 to October 2018, after being invited via seven MS clinics (specified in “Acknowledgements” section) and targeted advertisements sent out via the Danish MS Society.&quot;</span>
* Reasoning: The trial recruited participants through multiple channels, including MS clinics and targeted advertisements. This approach is more pragmatic than using a single recruitment method, such as targeted letters or advertisements in specific media outlets.
* Score: [4]
1. Setting:
* Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The interventions lasted 10 weeks. A total of 71 participants with impaired mobility (Timed 25-Foot Walk (T25FW) > 5 seconds or Six Spot Step Test (SSST) > 8 seconds) were enrolled.&quot;</span>
* Reasoning: The trial does not provide specific information about the setting in which the interventions were delivered. However, it can be inferred that the interventions were delivered in a clinical setting, as participants were recruited through MS clinics.
* Score: [NA]
1. Organization:
* Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;All training sessions were supervised by physiotherapists who were trained to deliver the intervention.&quot;</span>
* Reasoning: The trial indicates that the interventions were delivered by trained physiotherapists, suggesting that the resources and expertise required for the interventions were similar to those available in usual care.
* Score: [4]
1. Flexibility (delivery):
* Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The exercises were conducted in machines that targeted the specified muscle groups, but type of machines could vary between centers.&quot;</span>
* Reasoning: The trial allowed for some flexibility in the delivery of the interventions, as the type of machines used for the resistance training could vary between centers. However, the overall structure and content of the interventions were standardized.
* Score: [3]
1. Flexibility (adherence):
* Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Physiotherapists with experience in providing BMCT managed the programs. The therapists were instructed to aim for a level of difficulty, where the participants experienced failure but still reached successful execution in more than 50% of the attempts/time.&quot;</span>
* Reasoning: The trial allowed for some flexibility in the adherence to the interventions, as the physiotherapists were instructed to adjust the level of difficulty based on the participants' abilities. However, the overall goal of the interventions was to challenge the participants and improve their functional capacity.
* Score: [3]
1. Follow-up:
* Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The follow-up test was performed within 7 days of the last intervention session or after the last day of being on the waitlist.&quot;</span>
* Reasoning: The trial had a specific follow-up period of 7 days after the last intervention session, which is similar to the follow-up period that would be used in usual care.
* Score: [4]
1. Primary outcome:
* Quote: <span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 98.2%):

Primary outcomes were the T25FW and the SSST. Fatigue impact, self-perceived gait function, 6-minute walk, balance, and muscle strength were secondary outcomes.' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;The primary outcomes were the T25FW and the SSST. Fatigue impact, self-perceived gait function, 6-minute walk, balance, and muscle strength were secondary outcomes.&quot;</span>
* Reasoning: The trial had two primary outcomes, both of which are relevant to participants with MS and are commonly used in clinical practice. The secondary outcomes also cover a range of relevant domains, including fatigue, gait function, and muscle strength.
* Score: [5]
1. Primary analysis:
* Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Analyses were carried out as intention-to-treat, where all participants who completed the baseline assessment were included regardless of their adherence to the allocated intervention.&quot;</span>
* Reasoning: The trial used an intention-to-treat analysis, which includes all participants who were randomized, regardless of their adherence to the intervention. This approach is more pragmatic than excluding participants who did not adhere to the intervention.
* Score: [5]</pre>

publication full text</span> (mean similarity 100%)</i></p>
<pre>
1. Eligibility:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The inclusion criteria for the trial were clinical diagnosis of MS, as defined by the modified McDonald criteria, with an Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score of 1.0–6.5, and able to walk a 10-metre distance; aged 18–65 years; clinically stable for at least four weeks prior to entering the study; physically able to participate in exercise three times per week; able to provide written informed consent.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial included participants with a clinical diagnosis of MS, with an EDSS score ranging from 1.0 to 6.5, and the ability to walk a 10-metre distance. The age range was 18-65 years, and participants had to be clinically stable for at least four weeks prior to entering the study. These criteria are relatively broad and inclusive, making the trial more pragmatic. However, the requirement for participants to be physically able to participate in exercise three times per week and provide written informed consent may exclude some individuals who would receive the intervention in usual care.

Score: [4]

1. Recruitment:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;A total of 120 PwMS were recruited via the Sheffield MS Clinic and flyers/community adverts displayed at the local South Yorkshire MS Society branches.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial recruited participants through the Sheffield MS Clinic and community adverts, which is a relatively pragmatic approach. However, the use of flyers and community adverts may not be representative of the usual care setting, as these methods may not be used in usual care to engage with patients.

Score: [3]

1. Setting:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;During weeks 1–6, participants attended two supervised sessions per week at a university exercise research facility and engaged in one additional self-directed exercise session in their home environment.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial was conducted in a university exercise research facility, which may not be representative of the usual care setting. However, the inclusion of a home-based exercise session makes the trial more pragmatic.

Score: [3]

1. Organization:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The programme was designed to be pragmatic and accessible, taking into account exercise preferences and giving choices.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial was designed to be pragmatic and accessible, taking into account exercise preferences and giving choices. This suggests that the resources, provider expertise, and organization of care delivery in the intervention arm of the trial were similar to those available in usual care.

Score: [5]

1. Flexibility (delivery):
Quote: <span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 99.6%):

The supervised exercise sessions incorporated cognitivebehavioural techniques (e.g. goal setting, finding social support, understanding the costs/benefits of exercise, etc.) to promote long-term participation in physical activity.' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;The supervised exercise sessions incorporated cognitive-behavioural techniques (e.g. goal setting, finding social support, understanding the costs/benefits of exercise, etc.) to promote long-term participation in physical activity.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial incorporated cognitive-behavioural techniques to promote long-term participation in physical activity, which suggests that there was some flexibility in how the intervention was delivered. However, the use of a strict protocol and monitoring of compliance suggests that there was less flexibility than in usual care.

Score: [3]

1. Flexibility (adherence):
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants were encouraged to seek out opportunities to exercise in the local community (e.g. healthy living centres, health walks, fitness centres, swimming pools, etc.), based on their individual preferences.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial encouraged participants to seek out opportunities to exercise in the local community based on their individual preferences, which suggests that there was some flexibility in how participants had to adhere to the intervention. However, the use of measures to improve adherence if found wanting suggests that there was less flexibility than in usual care.

Score: [3]

1. Follow-up:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Outcomes were blindly assessed at baseline and at three and nine months after randomisation.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial assessed outcomes at baseline and at three and nine months after randomisation, which is more frequent than in usual care. However, the use of blinded assessors suggests that there was less measurement and follow-up of participants than in usual care.

Score: [2]

1. Primary outcome:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The primary outcome was self-reported exercise behaviour (Godin Leisure Time Exercise Questionnaire (GLTEQ)).&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The primary outcome was self-reported exercise behaviour, which is of obvious importance to participants. However, the use of a questionnaire to assess exercise behaviour may not be as relevant to participants as a more objective measure.

Score: [4]

1. Primary analysis:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;All analyses were by intention to treat, whereby participants were analysed in the arm to which they were randomised irrespective of whether they complied with the intervention.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial used intention-to-treat analysis, which includes all data in the analysis of the primary outcome. This is a more pragmatic approach than excluding ineligible post-randomisation participants or including only completers or those following the treatment protocol.

<p><i><span style="border-bottom: 1px dashed black;">9 quote(s) from
publication full text</span> (mean similarity 77.3%)</i></p>
<pre>
1. Eligibility:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Inclusion criteria were: age of 18 years or above; BDI score of at least 14 on two consecutive occasions and no treatment from psychologist, psychotherapist or psychiatrist within the last three months.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The eligibility criteria for this trial are relatively broad, including adults with a BDI score of at least 14 and no recent treatment from a mental health professional. This is more pragmatic than many trials, which often have more stringent exclusion criteria. However, the requirement for a BDI score of at least 14 may exclude some individuals who are experiencing depression but do not meet this threshold.

Score: [4]

1. Recruitment:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants were identified from clinic attenders, MS nurse patient visits and from patients with MS from the caseload of the neuropsychologist.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The recruitment strategy for this trial appears to be relatively pragmatic, as it involves identifying potential participants through routine clinical care. However, the use of a neuropsychologist to identify potential participants may be less pragmatic than other methods, such as recruitment through primary care providers.

Score: [3]

1. Setting:
Quote: <span title='Major quote deviation, possible hallucination. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 52.4%):

onnaires at two UK centres' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: red'>&quot;The study was conducted at two UK centres.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The setting for this trial is not explicitly described, but it appears to be conducted at two clinical centers. This is more pragmatic than a single-center trial, but less pragmatic than a trial conducted in a variety of settings, such as primary care clinics or community centers.

Score: [3]

1. Organization:
Quote: <span title='Major quote deviation, possible hallucination. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 50%):

s Research Unit, ScHARR, University of Sheffield,' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: red'>&quot;The study was coordinated by a research team based at the University of Sheffield.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The organization of this trial is not explicitly described, but it appears to be coordinated by a research team based at a university. This is less pragmatic than a trial that is integrated into routine clinical care, but more pragmatic than a trial that requires significant additional resources or infrastructure.

Score: [3]

1. Flexibility (delivery):
Quote: <span title='Major quote deviation, possible hallucination. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 52.1%):

computerised cognitive behavioural therapy (CCBT)' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: red'>&quot;The intervention was delivered via a computerized cognitive behavioral therapy (CCBT) program.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The delivery of the intervention in this trial is relatively inflexible, as it is delivered via a computerized program. This is less pragmatic than an intervention that can be delivered in a variety of ways, such as through face-to-face therapy or self-help materials.

Score: [2]

1. Flexibility (adherence):
Quote: <span title='Major quote deviation, possible hallucination. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 60.9%):

) completed at least four CCBT sessions.' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: red'>&quot;Participants were asked to complete at least four CCBT sessions.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The flexibility of adherence in this trial is relatively low, as participants are asked to complete at least four CCBT sessions. This is less pragmatic than an intervention that allows for more flexibility in adherence, such as a self-help program that can be completed at the participant's own pace.

Score: [2]

1. Follow-up:
Quote: <span title='Moderate quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 86.6%):

participants in each arm were lost to follow-up at 21 weeks post-randomisation.' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ff9e81'>&quot;Participants were followed up at 8 and 21 weeks post-randomization.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The follow-up schedule for this trial is relatively pragmatic, as it involves two follow-up assessments at 8 and 21 weeks post-randomization. However, the use of a specific follow-up schedule may be less pragmatic than a trial that allows for more flexible follow-up assessments.

Score: [4]

1. Primary outcome:
Quote: <span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 95.1%):

The primary clinical endpoint was the mean change in self-reported symptoms of depression as measured on the BDI.' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;The primary outcome was the mean change in self-reported symptoms of depression as measured on the BDI.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The primary outcome for this trial is relatively pragmatic, as it involves measuring self-reported symptoms of depression using a widely used and validated scale. However, the use of a single outcome measure may be less pragmatic than a trial that includes multiple outcome measures.

Score: [4]

1. Primary analysis:
Quote: <span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 98.2%):

thods Primary analysis was an Intention To Treat (ITT) analysis' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;The primary analysis was an intention-to-treat analysis.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The primary analysis for this trial is relatively pragmatic, as it involves an intention-to-treat analysis that includes all randomized participants. However, the use of a single analysis method may be less pragmatic than a trial that includes multiple analysis methods.

<p><i><span style="border-bottom: 1px dashed black;">8 quote(s) from
publication full text</span> (mean similarity 99.9%)</i></p>
<pre>
1. Eligibility:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Patients (N = 861) were randomly assigned 1:1 to receive GA20 (n = 430) or GA40 (n = 431) during the core phase.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: The trial includes a large number of participants and does not seem to have many exclusion criteria, as it only excludes patients with previous exposure to GA40. This suggests that the participants in the trial are similar to those who would receive this intervention if it was part of usual care.
Score: [4]

2. Recruitment:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Patients in the study received treatment for 6 months, and the study was conducted during a period starting in August 2015 and ending in January 2017.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: The recruitment period is not explicitly stated, but the study was conducted over a period of 1.5 years. This suggests that the recruitment was likely done through usual appointments or clinic, as there is no mention of targeted invitation letters, advertising, or incentives.
Score: [4]

3. Setting:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The CONFIDENCE study was a multinational, multicenter, randomized, parallel-group, phase 4, open-label study conducted at 88 study centers in 14 countries (Russia, Poland, Italy, France, Croatia, US [including Puerto Rico], Mexico, Spain, Austria, Turkey, Belgium, Argentina, Germany, and Finland) across different geographic regions.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: The trial was conducted in multiple countries and centers, which suggests that the setting is similar to usual care. However, the use of 88 study centers may indicate a more controlled environment than usual care.
Score: [3]

4. Organization:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Patients in the study received treatment for 6 months, and the study was conducted during a period starting in August 2015 and ending in January 2017.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: The trial duration is 6 months, which is a relatively short period compared to the usual duration of treatment for multiple sclerosis. This suggests that the resources, provider expertise, and organization of care delivery in the intervention arm of the trial may not be identical to those available in usual care.
Score: [3]

5. Flexibility (delivery):
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Patients who stopped treatment with the study drug before Month 6 were considered early treatment discontinuation patients and attended an early treatment discontinuation visit.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: The trial protocol allows for flexibility in the delivery of the intervention, as patients who discontinue treatment are still followed up. However, the use of a strict protocol and monitoring suggests that there may be less flexibility than in usual care.
Score: [3]

6. Flexibility (adherence):
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Adherence to treatment when the dosing schedule differs is complicated, because missing one dose has potentially differential impacts on treatment. Thus, adherence was measured using the self-reported MS-TAQ.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: The trial measures adherence using a self-reported questionnaire, which is a common method in usual care. However, the use of a specific questionnaire and the focus on adherence suggest that there may be more emphasis on adherence than in usual care.
Score: [3]

7. Follow-up:
Quote: <span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 99.2%):

Patients also participated in self-reported, daily athome MSQ assessments on Days 1 through 7 after the baseline visit.' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;Patients also participated in self-reported, daily at-home MSQ assessments on Days 1 through 7 after the baseline visit.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: The trial includes self-reported daily assessments, which may be more intensive than usual follow-up in care. However, the use of self-reported assessments suggests that the follow-up is still similar to usual care.
Score: [4]

8. Primary outcome:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The primary endpoint was patient-reported medication satisfaction using the Medication Satisfaction Questionnaire (MSQ).&quot;</span>
Reasoning: The primary outcome is patient-reported medication satisfaction, which is relevant to participants. However, the use of a specific questionnaire suggests that the outcome may not be of obvious importance to participants.
Score: [3]

9. Primary analysis:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Patient-reported endpoints were analyzed based on the full analysis set (FAS), which included all patients in the ITT population who received at least 1 dose of study drug and had at least 1 post-baseline assessment.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: The trial uses an intention-to-treat analysis with all available data, which is a pragmatic approach. However, the exclusion of ineligible post-randomization participants suggests that the analysis may not include all data.

* Quote 1: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;People with relapsing–remitting MS were randomly allocated to either a PRT program&quot;</span> [...] <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot; or usual care plus an attention and social program&quot;</span> [...] <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot; Outcomes were recorded at baseline, week 10 and week 22.&quot;</span>
* Quote 2: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;To be included, people had to be aged 18 years or more, have a confirmed diagnosis of relapsing–remitting MS, have an Ambulation Index score of 2, 3 or 4 (mild to moderate walking disabilities), and have received medical clearance to participate.&quot;</span>
* Quote 3: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Volunteers were excluded if they had an acute exacerbation of MS within 2 months of starting the program, had benign or progressive/relapsing types of MS, had a serious unstable medical condition, had any concurrent condition, for example stroke, or had participated in a PRT program in the 6 months before training started.&quot;</span>
* Reasoning: The trial included participants with relapsing–remitting MS and mild to moderate walking disabilities, which is similar to the usual care population. However, the trial excluded participants with other types of MS, serious medical conditions, or recent participation in PRT programs. This suggests a more explanatory approach with some exclusions.
* Score: [3]
1. Recruitment:
* Quote 1: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants were recruited through a statewide organization providing education and support to people with MS, and a large specialist MS outpatient clinic.&quot;</span>
* Quote 2: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Recruitment information flyers were sent by mail to all potential participants registered on the mailing lists of both organizations.&quot;</span>
* Reasoning: The trial recruited participants through usual care settings and mailing lists, which is similar to the usual care recruitment process. However, the trial did not mention any additional efforts to recruit participants, such as targeted invitation letters or advertising.
* Score: [4]
1. Setting:
* Quote 1: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The experimental group completed a 10-week (two times per week), PRT program in one of four community gymnasiums in metropolitan and regional areas.&quot;</span>
* Reasoning: The trial was conducted in community gymnasiums, which is similar to the usual care setting. However, the trial did not specify whether these gymnasiums were identical to the usual care setting or if they were specialized trial or academic centers.
* Score: [4]
1. Organization:
* Quote 1: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Each program was attended by a group of up to 12 participants, and they were supervised by up to three experienced trainers (physiotherapists and registered personal sports trainers).&quot;</span>
* Quote 2: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Each exercise session was completed in around 45 min, and at the end of each session there was a 30-min recovery period when the participants had refreshments and time to socialize.&quot;</span>
* Reasoning: The trial involved experienced trainers and a recovery period, which may not be available in usual care. However, the trial did not mention any additional resources, provider expertise, or changes in the organization of care delivery.
* Score: [4]
1. Flexibility (delivery):
* Quote 1: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The training intensity was based on recommendations of the American College of Sports Medicine (2009) and consisted of two sets of 10–12 repetitions of each exercise, at a training intensity of 10–12 repetition maximum (that is, only 12 consecutive repetitions of each exercise could be completed before muscle fatigue was reached).&quot;</span>
* Quote 2: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Two-minute rest periods were given between each exercise set.&quot;</span>
* Reasoning: The trial followed a strict protocol with specific training intensity, repetitions, and rest periods, which may not be available in usual care. However, the trial did not mention any measures to improve compliance or specific advice on allowed co-interventions and complications.
* Score: [3]
1. Flexibility (adherence):
* Quote 1: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants in the control group received ‘usual care’ plus a social program. ‘Usual care’ could include habitual exercise participants engaged in, or therapy, provided it did not include PRT.&quot;</span>
* Quote 2: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;In developing the control program careful consideration was given to optimizing participant attendance.&quot;</span>

* Score: [5]
1. Follow-up:
* Quote 1: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Outcome measurements were taken three times: at baseline, after 10 weeks to determine the immediate effects of the intervention, and after a further 12 weeks (week 22) to determine if any benefits from the program had been sustained.&quot;</span>
* Quote 2: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;After completing their 10-week intervention programs, participants were asked to return to their usual activities and not to continue or commence resistance training until after the follow-up assessment session.&quot;</span>
* Reasoning: The trial included follow-up assessments at 10 and 22 weeks, which is more frequent than usual care. However, the trial did not mention any unscheduled visits triggered by primary outcome events or intervening events, or more extensive data collection.
* Score: [3]
1. Primary outcome:
* Quote 1: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Changes in walking endurance were measured with the 2-minute walk test (2MWT).&quot;</span>

Score: [5]

4. Organisation:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;All treatment plans were approved by the clinical teacher in charge. The teacher also monitored treatment delivery, which involved the application of a variety of techniques appropriate to the client’s needs.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The study used the same resources, provider expertise, and organization of care delivery as in usual care. The treatment plans were approved by a clinical teacher, and a variety of techniques were used based on the clients' needs.

Score: [5]

5. Flexibility (delivery):
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The inclusion criterion for the study was a diagnosis of multiple sclerosis, and therefore the spectrum of clinical presentations was broad, as would be expected in this client population. All treatment plans were approved by the clinical teacher in charge. The teacher also monitored treatment delivery, which involved the application of a variety of techniques appropriate to the client’s needs.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The study allowed for flexibility in the delivery of the intervention, as the treatment plans were individualized and based on the clients' needs. This is similar to the flexibility that would be present in usual care.

Score: [5]

<p><i><span style="border-bottom: 1px dashed black;">9 quote(s) from
publication full text</span> (mean similarity 100%)</i></p>
<pre>
1. Eligibility:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Individuals were invited consecutively until the allocated number of standing frames (dependent on commissioning costs) at each health care organisation had been reached.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial seems to have broad inclusion criteria, inviting individuals consecutively until the allocated number of standing frames was reached. This suggests that the participants in the trial are likely to be similar to those who would receive this intervention if it was part of usual care. However, the trial does not explicitly state that the eligibility criteria are identical to those in usual care.

Score: [4]

1. Recruitment:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants were recruited through eight health care organisations, including the UK National Health Service (NHS) Trusts, social enterprises, and third sector multiple sclerosis therapy centres, in two regions (Devon–Cornwall and East Anglia) of the UK.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial recruited participants through various health care organizations, including NHS Trusts, social enterprises, and third sector multiple sclerosis therapy centres. This suggests that the recruitment methods are similar to those used in usual care. However, the trial does not explicitly state that no extra effort was made to recruit participants over and above what would be used in the usual care setting.

Score: [4]

1. Setting:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The SUMS study was an individually randomised, controlled, pragmatic, multi centre, superiority trial with masked outcome assessments in people with progressive mul tiple sclerosis.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial was conducted in multiple centers, which suggests that the setting is similar to that of usual care. However, the trial does not explicitly state that the setting is identical to that of usual care.

Score: [4]

1. Organization:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;All participants received their usual health and social service input throughout the study period.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial allowed participants to receive their usual health and social service input throughout the study period, which suggests that the resources, provider expertise, and organization of care delivery in the intervention arm of the trial are similar to those available in usual care. However, the trial does not explicitly state that the organization of care delivery is identical to that of usual care.

Score: [4]

1. Flexibility (delivery):
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants were asked to stand in the frame for 30 min three times per week over 20 weeks, and to record the frequency and duration of each stand in a daily diary.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial protocol specifies a strict protocol for the delivery of the intervention, with participants asked to stand in the frame for 30 minutes three times per week over 20 weeks. However, the trial does not explicitly state that there is no flexibility in how the intervention is delivered.

Score: [2]

1. Flexibility (adherence):
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;At the end of the 20-week period, participants were encouraged to continue to regularly stand, although no further physiotherapy support was provided.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial protocol encourages participants to continue to regularly stand after the 20-week intervention period, although no further physiotherapy support is provided. This suggests that there is some flexibility in how participants must adhere to the intervention. However, the trial does not explicitly state that there is no exclusion based on adherence or measures to improve adherence if found wanting.

Score: [3]

1. Follow-up:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The primary outcome was motor function as measured by the Amended Motor Club Assessment (AMCA) score at the primary endpoint of 36 weeks post randomisation.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial has a primary outcome measure of motor function as measured by the AMCA score at 36 weeks post-randomization. This suggests that the intensity of measurement and follow-up of participants in the trial is similar to that of usual care. However, the trial does not explicitly state that there is no more than usual follow-up.

Score: [4]

1. Primary outcome:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The AMCA score (range 0–76) is the sum of two subscores. The functional activity subscore (16 items, each scored 0–3) comprises key functional activities of the trunk and lower limbs, such as rolling in bed, sit-to-stand, and sitting and standing balance. The lower limb movement subscore (14 items, each scored 0–2) rates motor impairment by grading hip and knee flexion and knee flexion and dorsiflexion in lying, sitting, and standing positions.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial's primary outcome measure is the AMCA score, which is a clinically relevant outcome that is likely to be of obvious importance to participants. However, the trial does not explicitly state that the outcome is of obvious importance to participants.

Score: [4]

1. Primary analysis:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The primary analysis of the primary outcome, AMCA score at 36 weeks, followed a modified intention-to-treat approach, regardless of compliance to the intervention, but did exclude patients who were deemed ineligible after randomisation, those who withdrew from the trial and were unwilling for their previously collected data to be used, or those who did not provide baseline and week 36 measurements (ie, there was no imputation of missing baseline or week 36 scores for the primary analysis), and used an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) approach.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial's primary analysis follows a modified intention-to-treat approach, which includes all available data. However, the trial does not explicitly state that all data are included in the analysis of the primary outcome.

<p><i><span style="border-bottom: 1px dashed black;">12 quote(s) from
publication full text</span> (mean similarity 99.7%)</i></p>
<pre>
1. Eligibility:
   - Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants were referred to the project by themselves, their care-giver, MSI, chartered physiotherapists, neurologists, general practitioners or clinical nurse specialists.&quot;</span>
   - Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Eligible participants were over 18 years of age and had a diagnosis of MS that was confirmed by a consultant physician or neurologist.&quot;</span>
   - Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Persons with MS were excluded if they had a previous relapse or began steroid therapy in the 12 weeks prior to participating in the first assessment, were pregnant, or had a comorbidity that severely impacted their ability to safely participate in exercise.&quot;</span>
   - Reasoning: The eligibility criteria for this trial are relatively broad, allowing for referrals from various sources and including participants over 18 years of age with a confirmed diagnosis of MS. However, there are some exclusion criteria, such as recent relapse, steroid therapy, pregnancy, and severe comorbidities, which may limit the generalizability of the trial to the broader population of individuals with MS.
   - Score: [3]

2. Recruitment:
   - Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants were enrolled following their eligibility assessments, performed by the regional offices of MSI.&quot;</span>
   - Reasoning: The recruitment process for this trial appears to be primarily through the regional offices of MSI, which may not fully represent the usual care setting for individuals with MS. However, the trial does not mention any targeted invitation letters, advertising, or incentives, which are often associated with more explanatory approaches.
   - Score: [4]

3. Setting:
   - Quote: <span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 99.4%):

All interventions took place in groups of eight, for an hour per week, for 10 weeks. They were delivered in community centres such as local gyms, hotels and health centres.' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;All interventions took place in groups of eight, for an hour per week, for 10 weeks. They were delivered in community centres such as local gyms, hotels, and health centres.&quot;</span>
   - Reasoning: The trial was conducted in community settings, such as local gyms, hotels, and health centres, which are likely to be similar to the usual care settings for individuals with MS. This suggests a pragmatic approach to the trial design.
   - Score: [5]

4. Organization:
   - Quote: <span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 99%):

Treatment fidelity was optimised by the instructors and participants documenting programme adherence.' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;Treatment fidelity was optimized by the instructors and participants documenting programme adherence.&quot;</span>
   - Reasoning: The trial does not provide detailed information on the resources, provider expertise, or organization of care delivery in the intervention arm. However, the focus on treatment fidelity and documentation of program adherence suggests that the trial aimed to maintain consistency with usual care practices.
   - Score: [3]

5. Flexibility (delivery):
   - Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The PT-led exercise provided was pre-defined. It consisted of a circuit-style class of exercises that were either resisted by body weight or by the addition of free weights.&quot;</span>
   - Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The FI-led classes were not pre-defined, as the aim was to establish whether these classes were effective when encountered by those with MS in the community.&quot;</span>
   - Reasoning: The trial included both pre-defined and non-predefined interventions, with the PT-led exercise following a specific protocol and the FI-led classes being more flexible. This suggests a mix of explanatory and pragmatic approaches to intervention delivery.
   - Score: [3]

6. Flexibility (adherence):
   - Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants allocated to PT-led exercise attended a mean of 8.1 classes (95% CI 7.5, 8.5). Participants allocated to yoga attended a mean of 7.8 classes (95% CI 7.2, 8.3) and participants allocated to FI-led exercise attended a mean of 7.3 classes (95% CI 6.7, 7.9).&quot;</span>
   - Reasoning: The trial reports adherence rates for each intervention group, suggesting that there was some flexibility in how participants adhered to the interventions. However, the trial does not explicitly discuss measures to improve adherence or exclude participants based on adherence.
   - Score: [4]

7. Follow-up:
   - Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Outcome was assessed at week 24 for the intervention groups only, as it was felt that withholding a potentially beneficial treatment for longer than 12 weeks, from the controls, could be considered unethical.&quot;</span>
   - Reasoning: The trial included a follow-up assessment at week 24 for the intervention groups, which may be more intensive than usual care follow-up. However, the trial did not include more frequent, longer visits, unscheduled visits triggered by primary outcome events, or more extensive data collection, which are often associated with more explanatory approaches.
   - Score: [4]

8. Primary outcome:
   - Quote: <span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 99.5%):

The primary outcome measure was the physical component of the Multiple Sclerosis Impact Scale29, version 2 (MSIS-29v2), a patient-reported outcome measure that assesses the physical impact of MS.' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;The primary outcome measure was the physical component of the Multiple Sclerosis Impact Scale-29, version 2 (MSIS-29v2), a patient-reported outcome measure that assesses the physical impact of MS.&quot;</span>
   - Reasoning: The primary outcome measure for this trial is the physical component of the MSIS-29v2, which is a patient-reported outcome measure that assesses the physical impact of MS. This outcome is likely to be of obvious importance to participants and is relevant to their daily lives, suggesting a pragmatic approach to outcome selection.
   - Score: [5]

9. Primary analysis:
   - Quote: <span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 98.6%):

All statistical analyses were conducted using Predictive Analytics Software (PASW) Statistics 17. The distribution of the data was analysed using histograms, QuantileQuantile plots and the Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic.' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;All statistical analyses were conducted using Predictive Analytics Software (PASW) Statistics 17. The distribution of the data was analyzed using histograms, Quantile-Quantile plots, and the Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic.&quot;</span>
   - Reasoning: The trial does not explicitly discuss the primary analysis approach, such as intention-to-treat or per-protocol analysis. However, the use of statistical software and distribution analysis suggests a rigorous approach to data analysis, which may align more with explanatory trials.

1. Eligibility:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;CARE-MS II was a 2-year, randomized, rater-blinded, active comparator-controlled, head-to-head, trial of alemtuzumab (Lemtrada; Sanofi Genzyme, Cambridge, MA; 12 mg/day on 5 consecutive days at month 0 and on 3 consecutive days at month 12) vs SC IFN-b-1a (Rebif; EMD Serono, Rockland, MA; 44 mg 3 times weekly) in patients with RRMS with inadequate response to prior DMTs ($1 relapse during IFN-b or glatiramer acetate [GA] treatment [received for $6 months]).&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial included patients with RRMS who had an inadequate response to prior DMTs, which is a common criterion in clinical practice. However, the requirement of a specific number of relapses during prior treatment may limit the generalizability of the results to patients with different disease courses.

Score: [3]

1. Recruitment:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Percentage of patients with recent prestudy relapse was also equivalent between groups (alemtuzumab, 32%; SC IFN-b-1a, 33%).&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial does not provide detailed information on the recruitment process, but the equivalent percentage of patients with recent prestudy relapse between groups suggests that the recruitment strategy was not biased towards one treatment arm.

Score: [NA]

1. Setting:
Quote: <span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 98.7%):

Reasoning: The trial was not double-blinded, which may have introduced bias in the assessment of outcomes. However, the trial used blinded raters for key efficacy assessments, which may have mitigated this limitation.

Score: [2]

1. Flexibility (delivery):
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Blinded raters performed EDSS assessments at baseline, every 3 months, and when relapse was suspected.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial used a standardized protocol for the delivery of the interventions, which may limit the flexibility of the interventions in usual care. However, the trial allowed for EDSS assessments when relapse was suspected, which may have increased the flexibility of the interventions.

Score: [2]

1. Flexibility (adherence):

<pre>
1. Eligibility:
- Relevant quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Eligible patients completed all preintervention assessments before randomization. Randomization was conducted by the principal investigator who had no prior contact with patients and was fully blinded to all patient information, except study identification number of patients.&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The trial seems to have broad inclusion criteria, as it only excludes patients with certain medical conditions or those who are unable to speak or read German. The randomization process is also blinded, which suggests that the trial aims to reflect the usual care setting. However, the full text does not provide detailed information on the specific inclusion and exclusion criteria used in the trial.
- Score: [3]

2. Recruitment:
- Relevant quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;A total of 150 patients were randomly assigned to the intervention (n = 76) or to UC (n = 74).&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The trial recruited a relatively large number of patients, and the recruitment process does not appear to involve targeted invitation letters, advertising, or incentives that would not be used in usual care. However, the full text does not provide detailed information on the recruitment methods used in the trial.
- Score: [4]

3. Setting:
- Relevant quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;All patients in the usual care (UC) group (and in the MBI group) received regular, currently optimal medical care during the duration of the study, as provided by the neurology department of the hospital.&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The trial was conducted in a hospital setting, which is a common setting for the delivery of usual care for patients with multiple sclerosis. However, the full text does not provide detailed information on the specific setting(s) used in the trial.
- Score: [4]

4. Organization:
- Relevant quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;MBI closely followed the program of mindfulness-based stress reduction and included 1) a personal intake interview to define realistic goals of participants and establish personal rapport; 2) 8 weekly 2.5-hour classes in mindfulness practices (10 –15 participants/group; exercises did not exceed patients’ level of functioning); 3) one Saturday, 7-hour session at week 6; 4) homework assignments (approximately 40 minutes/day), emphasized as essential to success of the program; 5) a postintervention interview to evaluate personal experiences, goal attainment, and future maintenance of acquired skills.&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The trial involved a structured intervention program that was delivered by experienced, certified teachers. However, the full text does not provide detailed information on the resources, provider expertise, and organization of care delivery in the intervention arm of the trial.
- Score: [3]

5. Flexibility (delivery):
- Relevant quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Mindfulness exercises included observation of sensory, affective, and cognitive domains of perceptible experience.&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The trial allowed for some flexibility in the delivery of the intervention, as the mindfulness exercises were tailored to the participants' level of functioning. However, the full text does not provide detailed information on the extent to which the intervention was delivered with flexibility in the trial.
- Score: [3]

6. Flexibility (adherence):
- Relevant quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;MBI participants reported practicing, on average, 5.11 times/week (SD 2.24; CI 4.59 –5.64 times), a total time average of 76% of assigned homework (SD 13.80; CI 72.76%–79.25%).&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The trial allowed for some flexibility in adherence to the intervention, as participants were encouraged to practice mindfulness exercises at home. However, the full text does not provide detailed information on the extent to which participants were excluded based on adherence or measures to improve adherence if found wanting.
- Score: [3]

7. Follow-up:
- Relevant quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Assessments were made at baseline, postintervention, and 6 months follow-up.&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The trial involved a relatively long follow-up period of 6 months, which is longer than the usual follow-up period in clinical practice. However, the full text does not provide detailed information on the intensity of measurement and follow-up of participants in the trial.
- Score: [3]

8. Primary outcome:
- Relevant quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Primary outcomes included disease-specific and disease-aspecific HRQOL, depression, and fatigue.&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The trial used relevant and important primary outcomes that are of obvious importance to participants with multiple sclerosis. However, the full text does not provide detailed information on the extent to which the trial's primary outcome was relevant to participants.
- Score: [4]

9. Primary analysis:
- Relevant quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Employing intention-to-treat analysis, MBI, compared with UC, improved nonphysical dimensions of primary outcomes at postintervention and follow-up (p < 0.002); effect sizes, 0.4–0.9 posttreatment and 0.3–0.5 at follow-up.&quot;</span>
- Reasoning: The trial used an intention-to-treat analysis, which is a pragmatic approach that includes all available data. However, the full text does not provide detailed information on the extent to which all data were included in the analysis of the primary outcome.

<p><i><span style="border-bottom: 1px dashed black;">9 quote(s) from
publication full text</span> (mean similarity 98.1%)</i></p>
<pre>
1. Eligibility:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Subjects were eligible for recruiting if they met the following criteria: (1) age > 18 years; (2) established diagnosis of the specific pathological condition MS, stroke or tBI; (3) nine hole peg test (NHPG) performed in more than 25 seconds; (4) ability to move at least one peg in 180 seconds during the NHPG; (5) sufficient autonomous functioning; (6) internet connection or telephone line and reachable internet provider; (7) clinical status stable; (8) discharged from hospital or rehabilitation setting – person lives at home.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The eligibility criteria for this trial are relatively broad and inclusive, allowing for a wide range of patients with chronic stroke, traumatic brain injury (tBI), and multiple sclerosis (MS) to participate. The criteria focus on ensuring that participants have a stable clinical status, are able to perform basic tasks, and have access to necessary technology. These criteria are similar to those that would be used in usual care settings, making the trial more pragmatic in nature.

Score: [4]

1. Recruitment:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Patients were recruited from Unità Organica di riabilitazione Intensiva Neuromotoria (UOrIN, Italy), Foundation Institute Guttmann (FPING, Spain) and from National Multiple Sclerosis centre (NMSc, Belgium).&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The recruitment strategy for this trial involves recruiting patients from multiple centers, including rehabilitation centers and a multiple sclerosis center. This approach is similar to how patients would be recruited in usual care settings, making the trial more pragmatic in nature. However, the full text does not provide detailed information on the recruitment methods used, such as whether targeted invitation letters or advertising were employed.

Score: [3]

1. Setting:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;the physicians of the three rehabilitation centres included patients following the inclusion and exclusion criteria.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial is conducted in rehabilitation centers, which are the usual care settings for patients with chronic stroke, traumatic brain injury (tBI), and multiple sclerosis (MS). This makes the trial more pragmatic in nature, as it reflects the real-world settings in which patients would receive care.

Score: [5]

1. Organization:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;the intervention group underwent one month of usual care, followed by approximately 4 training sessions with the H-caD system in the hospital. the actual intervention with the H-caD system at home consisted of one month, whereby the patients had an average of one training session a day lasting 30 minutes for at least 5 days a week.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The organization of care delivery in this trial is a mix of usual care and the H-caD system intervention. Patients receive one month of usual care before starting the H-caD system intervention, which is delivered at home with regular training sessions. This approach is more pragmatic than a trial that would require significant changes to the organization of care delivery, but it still involves some additional resources and training for the H-caD system intervention.

Score: [3]

1. Flexibility (delivery):
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;the patient and the therapist had a weekly scheduled videoconference.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial allows for some flexibility in the delivery of the H-caD system intervention, as patients have weekly videoconferences with their therapists. However, the trial also specifies that patients should have an average of one training session a day lasting 30 minutes for at least 5 days a week, which may limit flexibility. Overall, the trial is more pragmatic than explanatory in terms of flexibility in delivery.

Score: [4]

1. Flexibility (adherence):
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;the patients in the intervention group maintained the same function on grasping objects and on gross movements during the complete testing period (ara test).&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial does not provide explicit information on measures to improve adherence or exclude participants based on adherence. However, the results suggest that patients in the intervention group maintained their function during the trial, which may indicate good adherence. Given the lack of specific information on adherence, it is difficult to definitively score this domain.

Score: [NA]

1. Follow-up:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;all measurements were performed at the centre where the patient had been treated.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial specifies that all measurements are performed at the center where the patient had been treated, which may be more intensive than usual care follow-up. However, the trial does not provide detailed information on the frequency or duration of follow-up visits, making it difficult to definitively score this domain.

Score: [NA]

1. Primary outcome:
Quote: <span title='Moderate quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 82.6%):

lItAtIon clInIcAl trIAl was: is the use of the H-caD system for one month at least as good as usual care for the arm/hand function in stroke, tBI and MS patients?' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ff9e81'>&quot;the main research question in this validation trial was: is the use of the H-caD system for one month at least as good as usual care for the arm/hand function in stroke, tBI and MS patients?&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The primary outcome of this trial is the arm/hand function in stroke, traumatic brain injury (tBI), and multiple sclerosis (MS) patients, which is a relevant and important outcome for these patient populations. This makes the trial more pragmatic in nature, as it focuses on a clinically meaningful outcome.

Score: [5]

1. Primary analysis:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;the goal of the clinical trial was to show that the effect of a new treatment (H-caD) is equal effective as the existing treatment (usual care).&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial aims to demonstrate the equivalence of the H-caD system intervention to usual care, which is a more pragmatic approach than attempting to demonstrate superiority. However, the full text does not provide detailed information on the primary analysis, such as whether intention-to-treat analysis was used, making it difficult to definitively score this domain.

1. Eligibility:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Patients in South East London who were severely affected by MS were referred by clinicians to the trial.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: The trial included patients who were severely affected by MS, which is similar to the usual care population. However, the trial did not specify any other inclusion or exclusion criteria, making it difficult to assess the eligibility domain fully.
Score: [NA]
2. Recruitment:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;After baseline interview, patients were randomly allocated to either a multiprofessional palliative care team (PCT) immediately (fast track) or the control care group who continued best usual care for three months and then were offered the PCT.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: The trial used a fast-track design, which is a pragmatic approach to recruitment. Patients were recruited through usual appointments or clinics, and there was no targeted invitation or advertising.
Score: [5]
3. Setting:
Quote: <span title='Moderate quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 86.7%):

the trial (Fig. 1). Inclusion criteria were patients in South East London,' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ff9e81'>&quot;The trial was conducted in South East London.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: The trial was conducted in a usual care setting, which is a pragmatic approach. The trial did not specify any specialised trial or academic centres.
Score: [5]
4. Organisation:
Quote: <span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 98.5%):

PCT. 18,20 This comprised one part-time consultant in palliative medicine, one part-time clinical nurse specialist, one administrator, and one psychosocial worker, and was based in a large teaching hospital.' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;The PCT comprised one part-time consultant in palliative medicine, one part-time clinical nurse specialist, one administrator, and one psychosocial worker, and was based in a large teaching hospital.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: The trial used a pragmatic approach to the organisation of care delivery. The PCT was based in a usual care setting and did not require additional staff levels, training, or resources.
Score: [5]
5. Flexibility (delivery):
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Patients were visited in their own homes or sometimes outpatient clinics, nursing homes, or hospital.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: The trial used a pragmatic approach to the flexibility of intervention delivery. The PCT visited patients in their usual care settings and did not have a strict protocol or measures to improve compliance.
Score: [5]
6. Flexibility (adherence):
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;There was no significant difference over time in POS-8, but at Week 12, caregiver burden ZBI scores had reduced in the fast-track group and increased slightly in the control group.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: The trial did not report any measures to improve adherence or exclude participants based on adherence. Therefore, it is not possible to assess the flexibility (adherence) domain.
Score: [NA]
7. Follow-up:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Data were collected at baseline, 6, 12, 18, and 26 weeks on use of services, patient symptoms, other outcomes, and caregiver burden.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: The trial used a pragmatic approach to follow-up, with data collected at usual care intervals. The trial did not report any unscheduled visits triggered by primary outcome events or intervening events.
Score: [5]
8. Primary outcome:
Quote: <span title='Moderate quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 77.1%):

We evaluated the cost-effectiveness of a new palliative care service for people with multiple sclerosis (MS).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ff9e81'>&quot;The trial's primary outcome was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of a new palliative care service for people with multiple sclerosis (MS).&quot;</span>
Reasoning: The trial's primary outcome was relevant to participants, as it evaluated the cost-effectiveness of a new palliative care service for people with MS. The trial did not use a surrogate or physiological outcome, central adjudication, or assessment expertise that is not available in usual care.
Score: [5]
9. Primary analysis:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;We planned an intention-to-treat analysis, irrespective of whether patients were assessed as having palliative care needs or the nature of contact with the PCT.&quot;</span>

<pre>
1. Eligibility:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Eligibility criteria for patients: diagnosis RRMS since at least one year, EDSS score ≤4.0, no symptoms suggestive of a relapse, no relapse in the preceding four weeks, willing and capable of participating in the investigations, and having access to the internet for performing the web-based assessments.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The eligibility criteria for this trial are relatively broad, including patients with a diagnosis of RRMS for at least one year and an EDSS score of 4.0 or less. The criteria also exclude patients with symptoms suggestive of a relapse or a recent relapse, which is a common exclusion criterion in clinical trials. The requirement for internet access for web-based assessments may limit the generalizability of the trial to patients without internet access. However, overall, the eligibility criteria are relatively pragmatic and similar to those used in usual care.

Score: [4]

2. Recruitment:
Quote: <span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 97.4%):

pants were recruited from all over the Netherlands by the patient organisation NMSF, Rotterdam, the Netherlands.' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;Patients were recruited from all over the Netherlands by the patient organisation NMSF, Rotterdam, the Netherlands.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The recruitment strategy for this trial involved a patient organization, which may not be a typical recruitment method used in usual care. However, the trial aimed to recruit patients from all over the Netherlands, which suggests a broad and pragmatic approach to recruitment.

Score: [3]

3. Setting:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;CDT was given during three consecutive days in Zorghotel Spelderholt, Beekbergen, the Netherlands, a facility especially equipped for the accommodation of people with impaired health.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial was conducted in a specialized facility for people with impaired health, which may not be a typical setting used in usual care. However, the trial was conducted in a single center, which is a common setting for clinical trials.

Score: [2]

4. Organization:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The multidisciplinary team included a psychiatrist, psychiatric nurse, neurologist, registered nurse specialized in MS, physiotherapist, dance therapist, and a person with MS.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial involved a multidisciplinary team, which is a common approach in usual care for patients with MS. However, the inclusion of a dance therapist and a person with MS may not be typical in usual care.

Score: [3]

5. Flexibility (delivery):
Quote: <span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 97.1%):

Components. CDT’s components are large group sessions, small group sessions, consultations (carrousel), a theatre evening, and start of the day with a joint activity (optional)' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;The components of CDT are large group sessions, small group sessions, consultations (carrousel), a theatre evening, and start of the day with a joint activity (optional).&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial involved a structured intervention with specific components, which may not be typical in usual care. However, the trial allowed for some flexibility in the delivery of the intervention, such as the optional joint activity at the start of the day.

Score: [3]

6. Flexibility (adherence):
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;During CDT, safety aspects and adverse events were assessed and documented by the multidisciplinary team at the end of each day.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial involved monitoring of safety aspects and adverse events, which is a common approach in clinical trials. However, the trial did not explicitly mention any measures to improve adherence to the intervention.

Score: [3]

7. Follow-up:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Assessments were at baseline and at one, three and six months follow-up via online questionnaires.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial involved follow-up assessments at multiple time points, which is a common approach in clinical trials. However, the use of online questionnaires may not be typical in usual care.

Score: [3]

8. Primary outcome:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The primary study outcome was the change in control self-efficacy, assessed by the Multiple Sclerosis Self-Efficacy Scale (MSSES), at six months.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The primary outcome of the trial was control self-efficacy, which is a relevant outcome for patients with MS. The use of a validated scale to assess this outcome is a common approach in clinical trials.

Score: [5]

9. Primary analysis:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;All endpoints were analyzed according to the intention-to-treat principle using an ANCOVA with the 6-month value as dependent variable, and condition, baseline value, disease duration and gender as independent variables.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial used an intention-to-treat analysis, which is a common approach in clinical trials. The use of ANCOVA with multiple independent variables is also a common approach in clinical trials.

<pre>
1. Eligibility:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Inclusion criteria were: 1) having a definite diagnosis of MS from a neurologist; 2) being within 5 years of receiving a diagnosis of MS; 3) scoring at least 10 on the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) [26]; 4) not currently undertaking other psychological treatment for depressive or anxiety symptoms for the length of participation in the current trial; 5) speak English fluently; 6) no current or lifetime diagnosis of psychosis; 7) no current substance dependency; 8) no gross cognitive impairment; and 9) no changes to medications prior and during involvement in the trial.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The eligibility criteria for this trial are quite specific, including a definite diagnosis of MS, being within 5 years of diagnosis, scoring at least 10 on the BDI-II, and not currently undergoing other psychological treatment. However, these criteria are still relevant to the usual care setting, as patients with these characteristics would be considered for treatment in a clinical setting.

Score: [3]

1. Recruitment:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants were recruited through neurologists working in a large MS outpatient clinic at the hospital, advertisements on MS related websites and local press releases.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The recruitment methods used in this trial are similar to those that would be used in a usual care setting, such as referrals from neurologists and advertisements. However, the use of press releases may be considered more targeted than usual care.

Score: [4]

1. Setting:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The study took place at a large teaching and research hospital in Melbourne, Australia.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial was conducted in a hospital setting, which is a typical setting for the treatment of MS patients. However, the fact that it was a teaching and research hospital may introduce some differences from usual care.

Score: [3]

1. Organization:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;A senior clinical psychologist and a provisional clinical psychologist (supervised by the clinical psychologist) provided the intervention.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial used clinical psychologists to provide the intervention, which is similar to the usual care setting. However, the use of a provisional clinical psychologist under supervision may introduce some differences from usual care.

Score: [4]

1. Flexibility (delivery):
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;All sessions (apart from the first session which was 1.5 h) were 1 h in duration and took place in a clinic room at the hospital.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial used a structured intervention with specific session lengths and locations, which may be less flexible than usual care. However, the use of a clinic room at the hospital is similar to usual care.

Score: [2]

1. Flexibility (adherence):
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;There were no drop-outs and participants completed all treatment modules.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial had high adherence rates, with no drop-outs and all participants completing the treatment modules. This suggests that the trial was more structured and less flexible than usual care in terms of adherence.

Score: [2]

1. Follow-up:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Follow up assessments ended April, 2015.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial had a specific follow-up period, which may be less flexible than usual care. However, the length of follow-up is not specified, so it is difficult to determine the extent of flexibility.

Score: [3]

1. Primary outcome:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The primary outcome was level of depressive symptoms using the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II).&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The primary outcome of the trial was the level of depressive symptoms, which is a relevant outcome for patients with MS. The use of the BDI-II is a validated measure of depressive symptoms, which is commonly used in clinical practice.

Score: [5]

<pre>
1. Eligibility:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants had a confirmed diagnosis of multiple sclerosis, an Extended Disability Status Scale score of 5 (ambulatory without aid or rest for about 200 m) to 6.5 (constant bilateral assistance required to walk about 20 m without resting), stable rehabilitation and drug therapy for 30 days before entry into the study, cognitive scores of over 24 on the Mini-Mental State Examination, and access to the intervention sites using their own or public transport.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The eligibility criteria for this trial are quite specific, including a confirmed diagnosis of multiple sclerosis, a specific range of disability scores, stable rehabilitation and drug therapy, and cognitive scores above a certain threshold. This suggests a more explanatory approach, as the trial is not open to all individuals with multiple sclerosis, but rather a specific subset of patients.

Score: [2]

1. Recruitment:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Of the 873 patients on the clinical register for multiple sclerosis 159 patients were deemed suitable for the study. These people were sent invitation letters and participant information sheets.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The recruitment process involved sending invitation letters to a subset of patients deemed suitable for the study. This suggests a more targeted approach to recruitment, which is more explanatory than pragmatic.

Score: [2]

1. Setting:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The intervention took place at two different geographical locations (Site A and Site B).&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial was conducted at two different community leisure centers, which is a more pragmatic approach as it reflects the usual care setting for individuals with multiple sclerosis who may engage in community-based exercise programs.

Score: [4]

1. Organization:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The group session involved a 10-minute warm-up of aerobic and stretching components, 30–40 minutes of circuit exercises (Appendix 1 on-line), designed to train aerobic endurance, resistance and balance, and a 5–10 minute cool-down, involving aerobic work, stretching and relaxation.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The organization of the intervention involves a structured exercise program with specific components, which is more explanatory than pragmatic. However, the use of community leisure centers as the setting for the intervention suggests a more pragmatic approach.

Score: [3]

1. Flexibility (delivery):
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants completed a circuit of 8–12 different exercises for 1 minute each, having a rest (of a minimum of 1 minute) before moving to the next exercise. Not all exercises were performed at all classes, and in week 9 a fifth level of difficulty was added to some of the exercises to encourage progress.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The flexibility in the delivery of the intervention is moderate, as participants are allowed to choose the level of difficulty for each exercise and rest as needed. However, the structured nature of the circuit exercises and the addition of a fifth level of difficulty in week 9 suggest a more explanatory approach.

Score: [3]

1. Flexibility (adherence):
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants were provided with exercise progress cards and were asked to record which level they performed each exercise at each session.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial does not explicitly mention measures to improve adherence or exclude participants based on adherence, suggesting a more pragmatic approach. However, the use of exercise progress cards to track participants' progress may encourage adherence to some extent.

Score: [4]

1. Follow-up:
Quote: <span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 99.5%):

Outcome measures were carried out within the local hospital’s rehabilitation unit. They were taken at baseline, after 8 and 12 weeks of the intervention period (i.e. either the exercise class or usual care).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;Outcome measures were carried out within the local hospital's rehabilitation unit. They were taken at baseline, after 8 and 12 weeks of the intervention period (i.e., either the exercise class or usual care).&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The follow-up intensity in this trial is moderate, with assessments conducted at baseline, 8 weeks, and 12 weeks. This is more pragmatic than explanatory, as it reflects the usual care setting for individuals with multiple sclerosis who may undergo periodic assessments as part of their rehabilitation.

Score: [4]

1. Primary outcome:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The primary outcome measure was 25-foot (7.6 m) walk time.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The primary outcome measure in this trial is the 25-foot walk time, which is a relevant and important outcome for individuals with multiple sclerosis. This suggests a more pragmatic approach, as the outcome is directly related to patients' daily functioning.

Score: [5]

1. Primary analysis:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;All outcome measures were analysed on the basis of intention to treat, with all variables summarized and comparisons made between groups and over time.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The primary analysis in this trial is based on intention-to-treat, which is a more pragmatic approach as it includes all available data and does not exclude participants based on post-randomization factors.

1. Eligibility:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Specific inclusion criteria were (1) ambulatory (can walk 100 m, be capable of walking 100 metres without a walking aid corresponding to a classification of ⩽5.5 on the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS), even if they do use an aid for daily activities; and (2) self-reported to be sedentary or irregularly active at time of study entry (i.e. do not exercise 30 minutes or more twice per week of moderate to vigorous activity). This latter criterion was subsequently confirmed using activity monitoring for 7 days post-enrolment.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial includes participants who are ambulatory and sedentary or irregularly active, which is similar to the population that would receive the intervention in usual care. However, the trial excludes those who cannot walk 100 meters without a walking aid, which may not reflect the usual care population.

Score: [3]

1. Recruitment:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;People were recruited from four multiple sclerosis clinics in three Canadian cities and from posting on media sites. During the clinic visit, the treating neurologist introduced the study to their patients and referred them to the research assistant who further explained the study and assessed eligibility. Those contacting the research team directly were assessed for eligibility over the phone and sent information on the study electronically.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial uses a combination of clinic-based and media-based recruitment methods, which is similar to usual care. However, the use of a research assistant to explain the study and assess eligibility may not reflect usual care.

Score: [4]

1. Setting:
Quote: <span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 99.7%):

The trial protocol for this two-group, assessorblind, stratified, randomized 1:1, pragmatic, trial was published in 2013. 9 The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01611987.

The trial received ethical approval from the Montreal Neurological Hospital Research Ethics Board (NEU-12-005) and the Health Research Ethics Board, University of Manitoba (H2014:226).&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial is conducted in multiple centers and is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, which is similar to usual care. However, the use of a research assistant to explain the study and assess eligibility may not reflect usual care.

Score: [4]

1. Organization:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Once the assessments were completed, people were randomized. Randomization was stratified by site and people were assigned either to MSTEP© or General Guidelines using blocked randomization with random block sizes of 2, 4, and 6. The randomization was done using the web-based programme (http://www.randomization.com) by a statistician. Once the outcome assessments were completed, the statistician revealed the group assignment to the intervention staff.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial uses a randomization process that is similar to usual care. However, the use of a research assistant to explain the study and assess eligibility may not reflect usual care.

Score: [4]

1. Flexibility (delivery):
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Two different types of exercise interventions were contrasted. MSTEP©, a personally adapted exercise regimen including a variety of exercises targeting endurance, muscular, and core strength, balance, flexibility, muscular power, and speed of movement. The goal of the MSTEP© programme is to promote regular bouts of activity most days per week, encouraging a balance between rest and activity, and taking into consideration the physical and emotional status and capacity of the person. A unique feature of MSTEP© was to specifically target cardio-aerobic capacity through cardio-intensive exercise prescribed two times per week (Push Days) using the concept of interval training.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial allows for flexibility in the delivery of the intervention, which is similar to usual care. However, the use of a research assistant to explain the study and assess eligibility may not reflect usual care.

Score: [4]

1. Flexibility (adherence):
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;All had their exercise regimens reviewed during the intervention year at the evaluations which were scheduled at 3, 6, and 12 months. Evaluators were blinded to the group that the participant was in.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial allows for flexibility in adherence to the intervention, which is similar to usual care. However, the use of a research assistant to explain the study and assess eligibility may not reflect usual care.

Score: [4]

1. Follow-up:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;As there were four visits during the first year with four opportunities for missing data, the first set of analyses addressed whether the pattern of missing data was associated with the outcomes measured in this study. As the outcomes were continuous, linear regression was used with study status (missing baseline, baseline only, drop-out before end, or completer) as the explanatory variable, with baseline only serving as the reference category.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial allows for follow-up of participants, which is similar to usual care. However, the use of a research assistant to explain the study and assess eligibility may not reflect usual care.

Score: [4]

1. Primary outcome:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The primary outcome was exercise capacity as measured by peak oxygen consumption (VO 2peak) using a modified Bruce protocol on the cycle ergometer. The effectiveness indicator is the proportion of people making a 10% change in VO 2peak at the end of the 12-month intervention.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial uses a primary outcome that is relevant to participants, which is similar to usual care. However, the use of a research assistant to explain the study and assess eligibility may not reflect usual care.

Score: [4]

1. Primary analysis:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The primary analysis was of the proportion of people making an absolute improvement at the final time point, 12 months. The planned sample size was 240, 120 per group, based on 80% power, significance level of 0.05, and a hypothesized 20% response in the Guideline group and a 50% response in the MSTEP© group.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial uses an intention-to-treat analysis, which is similar to usual care. However, the use of a research assistant to explain the study and assess eligibility may not reflect usual care.

1. Eligibility:
Quote: <span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 98.1%):

Subjects had a definite diagnosis of primary or secondary progressive MS, and an EDSS of between 6.5 (constant bilateral assistance required to walk about 20 metres without resting) to 8 (essentially restricted to bed or chair or perambulated in wheelchair, but may be out of bed much of the day, retains many selfcare functions and generally has effective use of' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;Subjects had a definite diagnosis of primary or secondary progressive MS, and an EDSS of between 6.5 (constant bilateral assistance required to walk about 20 metres without resting) to 8 (essentially restricted to bed or chair or perambulated in wheelchair, but may be out of bed much of the day, retains many self-care functions and generally has effective use of arms).&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial includes participants with a definite diagnosis of primary or secondary progressive MS and an EDSS score between 6.5 and 8. This criteria is quite specific and excludes those with other types of MS or lower EDSS scores. However, it is still relevant to the usual care setting as these are the patients who would typically receive this intervention.

Score: [3]

1. Recruitment:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;People moderately to severely affected by MS were recruited from the MS Service, NHS Ayrshire and Arran.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial recruited participants from the MS Service, NHS Ayrshire and Arran, which is a usual care setting. However, the trial does not provide information on the recruitment methods used, such as targeted invitation letters or advertising.

Score: [NA]

1. Setting:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Setting: Community; subjects’ homes.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial was conducted in the community and subjects' homes, which is a usual care setting for this intervention.

Score: [5]

1. Organisation:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Subjects assigned to Group 1 received physiotherapy, twice weekly for eight weeks, by an experienced domiciliary physiotherapist within their home.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial used an experienced domiciliary physiotherapist to deliver the intervention, which is similar to usual care. However, the trial does not provide information on the resources, provider expertise, and the organisation of care delivery in the intervention arm of the trial and those available in usual care.

Score: [NA]

1. Flexibility (delivery):
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Each subject therefore received core treatments aimed to maximize strength, flexibility and function.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial used a task-specific programme that included upper and lower limb strengthening using theraband, mobile pedals, and weights. Repetition of tasks such as sit to stand, gait, balance (using gym balls and sit fits) and stretching activities were used depending on the subjects previously identified goals. This allows for some flexibility in the delivery of the intervention.

Score: [4]

1. Flexibility (adherence):
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The average number of sessions received by participants was 14.8 (out of a possible 16).&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial does not provide information on measures to improve adherence or exclusion based on adherence. However, the high number of sessions received by participants suggests good adherence.

Score: [NA]

1. Follow-up:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Subjects were assessed at the beginning and at the end of the eight-week intervention period (i.e. either physiotherapy or control) and then again eight weeks later.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial had a follow-up period of 16 weeks, which is longer than usual care. However, the frequency and intensity of measurement and follow-up of participants in the trial is not described in detail.

Score: [NA]

1. Primary outcome:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The MS impact scale (MSIS 29), which is a measure of the physical and psychological impact of MS, was the primary outcome measure for the study.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial used the MSIS-29 as the primary outcome measure, which is a patient-reported outcome measure that assesses the physical and psychological impact of MS. This outcome is relevant to participants and is commonly used in clinical trials of interventions for MS.

Score: [5]

1. Primary analysis:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;All outcome variables were summarized and comparisons made between groups and over time.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial used a two-factor repeated measures ANOVA to analyze the primary outcome, which is a pragmatic approach that includes all available data.

1. Eligibility:
Quote: <span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 98.5%):

The only selection criterion was that the diagnosis of MS was con rmed by the general practitioner. There were no exclusion criteria.' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;The only selection criterion was that the diagnosis of MS was confirmed by the general practitioner. There were no exclusion criteria.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial had very minimal exclusion criteria, only requiring a confirmed diagnosis of MS. This is similar to usual care, where patients with a confirmed diagnosis of MS would be eligible for treatment.

Score: [5]

2. Recruitment:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants were volunteers with MS who were recruited through voluntary organizations, were community based and lived in West London and in counties contiguous with Greater London.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial recruited participants through voluntary organizations and community-based methods, which is similar to how patients with MS might be engaged in usual care.

Score: [4]

3. Setting:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The study was conducted with people with MS living in the community.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial was conducted in a community setting, which is similar to where patients with MS would receive treatment in usual care.

Score: [5]

4. Organization:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants were invited to join the study and were accepted when informed consent had been given in writing.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial did not appear to increase staff levels, provide additional training, or require more than usual experience or certification. The organization of care delivery in the trial was similar to usual care.

Score: [5]

5. Flexibility (delivery):
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants in the intervention group were contacted by telephone, by a health professional employed for the project, and an appointment was made to discuss self-care strategies relevant to each individual and to introduce the information booklet.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial allowed for flexibility in the delivery of the intervention, with individualized discussions and appointments made to accommodate each participant's needs. This is similar to the flexibility that would be present in usual care.

Score: [5]

6. Flexibility (adherence):
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Individuals were assigned to group or one-to-one sessions by the health professional in consultation with each person, and based on their needs and wishes.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial allowed for flexibility in adherence to the intervention, with participants being assigned to group or one-to-one sessions based on their needs and wishes. This is similar to the flexibility that would be present in usual care.

Score: [5]

Patients who were not living independently in the community were excluded.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial includes patients with MS who require a multidisciplinary approach, which is similar to the usual care setting. However, the exclusion of patients not living independently in the community may limit the generalizability of the trial to the broader MS population.

Score: [4]

1. Recruitment:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;MS patients from the outpatient clinic of the Neurology Department of Pitie´-Salpeˆtrie`re Hospital were prospectively enrolled in the study between March 2010 and July 2012.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial recruited patients from a single center, which may not reflect the usual care setting. However, the recruitment process does not appear to involve targeted invitation letters, advertising, or incentives that would not be used in usual care.

Score: [3]

1. Setting:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;This is a prospective, randomized, controlled, monocentric clinical trial in MS patients.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial was conducted in a single center, which may not reflect the usual care setting. However, the setting is not explicitly described as a specialized trial or academic center.

Score: [2]

1. Organization:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Two treatment strategies were compared: (i) an integrated multidisciplinary (IMD) approach, consisting of a half-day individually tailored comprehensive assessment in the MS clinic; and (ii) a standard care.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial compares an integrated multidisciplinary approach with standard care, which may reflect the usual care setting. However, the trial does not explicitly describe the resources, provider expertise, and organization of care delivery in the intervention arm.

Score: [3]

1. Flexibility (delivery):
Quote: <span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 97.5%):

Reasoning: The trial does not explicitly describe the flexibility in adherence to the intervention. However, the trial does not appear to involve measures to improve adherence or exclude participants based on adherence.

Score: [NA]

1. Follow-up:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Primary and secondary outcomes were assessed at inclusion, and after six (M6) and 12 (M12) months.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial involves follow-up assessments at 6 and 12 months, which may be more frequent than in usual care. However, the trial does not explicitly describe the intensity of measurement and follow-up of participants.

Score: [2]

1. Primary outcome:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The primary outcome was the impact of the strategy on quality of life (QoL) measured using the MSIS-29 scale at inclusion and after six months.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial measures the impact of the intervention on quality of life, which is relevant to participants. However, the trial does not explicitly describe the relevance of the primary outcome to participants.

Score: [4]

1. Primary analysis:

<pre>
1. Eligibility:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;To be included in the study participants were required to have a confirmed diagnosis of MS, an Expanded Disability Status Score of between 5 and 6.5, stable drug therapy for 30 days, no relapses in the previous three months, no significant co-morbidities such as coexisting cardiac or pulmonary condition and have access to the internet via personal or tablet computer.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The study has specific inclusion and exclusion criteria, such as a confirmed diagnosis of MS, a specific disability score range, and no significant comorbidities. However, the requirement for internet access is a pragmatic criterion, as it reflects the usual care setting for this intervention.

Score: [3]

1. Recruitment:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Letters were sent to 138 patients from the Multiple Sclerosis Service database, thought to be suitable for the study, inviting them to participate.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The recruitment method is relatively pragmatic, as it involves inviting patients from a service database. However, the study does not explicitly state whether additional recruitment efforts were made, such as targeted invitation letters or advertising.

Score: [4]

1. Setting:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants were recruited from the Multiple Sclerosis Service, at the Douglas Grant Rehabilitation Centre, Irvine, Scotland.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The study was conducted at a single rehabilitation center, which is an explanatory approach. However, the intervention itself (web-based physiotherapy) can be delivered in various settings, making it more pragmatic.

Score: [2]

1. Organization:
Quote: <span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 99.6%):

The website (www.webbasedphysio.com) consists of a home page, exercise pages and advice section. Each exercise page contains a video in half the screen, text explaining the exercise, an audio description of the exercise and a timer.' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;The website (www.webbased-physio.com) consists of a home page, exercise pages and advice section. Each exercise page contains a video in half the screen, text explaining the exercise, an audio description of the exercise and a timer.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The intervention is delivered through a website, which is a pragmatic approach as it does not require additional resources or expertise beyond what is available in usual care. However, the study does not provide information on the level of staffing or training required to deliver the intervention.

Score: [4]

1. Flexibility (delivery):
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants were advised to undertake the exercise programme a minimum of twice a week and to complete their online exercise diary which was seen remotely by the physiotherapist.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The intervention allows for some flexibility in delivery, as participants can complete the exercises at their convenience and at a frequency that suits them. However, the requirement for weekly contact with the physiotherapist may limit flexibility.

Score: [3]

1. Flexibility (adherence):
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants were contacted by the physiotherapist each week to discuss progress and update their exercise programme as appropriate by changing any combination of exercises, level of difficulty or number of repetitions.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The intervention allows for flexibility in adherence, as participants can modify their exercise program based on their progress and feedback from the physiotherapist. However, the weekly contact requirement may limit flexibility.

Score: [3]

1. Follow-up:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Outcome measures were recorded at baseline and at the end of the intervention period (week 13).&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The follow-up intensity is relatively pragmatic, as it involves measuring outcomes at baseline and after the 12-week intervention period. However, the study does not provide information on the frequency or duration of follow-up visits.

Score: [4]

1. Primary outcome:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The primary outcome measure, the timed 25ft walk, has good reliability and validity in the MS population.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The primary outcome measure is relevant to participants, as it assesses a functional aspect of MS that is important to patients. However, the use of a timed walk test may not fully capture the complexity of MS symptoms and their impact on daily life.

Score: [4]

1. Primary analysis:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;All outcome variables were analysed using repeated measures ANOVA models at the 5% level of significance.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The primary analysis includes all available data, which is a pragmatic approach. However, the study does not explicitly state whether intention-to-treat analysis was used.

Reasoning: The trial recruited patients from multiple centers and assessed their eligibility based on their suitability for home-based care. The inclusion criteria seem to be broad, as 201 out of 297 screened patients were eligible and willing to participate. This suggests that the trial has a pragmatic approach to eligibility criteria.

Score: [4]

1. Recruitment:
* Quote 1: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Patients were recruited from the multiple sclerosis centre of the neurological department of La Sapienza University, or from other institutional centres for multiple sclerosis in Rome.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial recruited patients from multiple centers and did not use targeted invitation letters, advertising, or incentives to recruit participants. This suggests a pragmatic approach to recruitment.

Score: [4]

1. Setting:
* Quote 1: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The study was conducted in Rome and was approved by the ethics committee of La Sapienza University.&quot;</span>
* Quote 2: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Patients were recruited from the multiple sclerosis centre of the neurological department of La Sapienza University, or from other institutional centres for multiple sclerosis in Rome.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial was conducted in a real-world setting, using multiple centers for patient recruitment. This suggests a pragmatic approach to the trial setting.

Score: [5]

1. Organization:
* Quote 1: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The multidisciplinary team collaborated with the patient, physician, and caregiver in designing individualised clinical care and in coordinating home services as appropriate for the individual patient.&quot;</span>
* Quote 2: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The type of care was more than is normally available in the community through National Health Service care.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial used a multidisciplinary team to provide individualized care, which is more than what is typically available in usual care. However, the resources and expertise provided by the team are likely to be available in usual care settings, albeit not as coordinated. This suggests a somewhat pragmatic approach to organization.

Score: [3]

Reasoning: The trial allowed for flexibility in the delivery of the intervention, with patients receiving care based on their individual needs. The multidisciplinary team provided a range of services, which suggests a pragmatic approach to flexibility in delivery.

Score: [4]

1. Flexibility (adherence):
* Quote 1: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Patients randomised to routine hospital care were followed as usual in their multiple sclerosis referral centres.&quot;</span>
* Quote 2: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;A brief monitoring phone call once a month was used to obtain information about the patient’s medical visits and hospital admissions in the previous month.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial did not explicitly address flexibility in adherence, but it did allow for some flexibility in the follow-up of patients in the control group. This suggests a somewhat pragmatic approach to flexibility in adherence.

Score: [3]

1. Follow-up:
* Quote 1: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;At the end of a one year follow up period, all patients underwent the same comprehensive interview as at baseline.&quot;</span>
* Quote 2: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;A brief monitoring phone call once a month was used to obtain information about the patient’s medical visits and hospital admissions in the previous month.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial had a one-year follow-up period, which is longer than what is typically used in usual care. However, the follow-up was not more intensive than what is typically used in usual care, as patients only received a monthly phone call. This suggests a somewhat pragmatic approach to follow-up.

Score: [3]

1. Primary outcome:
* Quote 1: <span title='Major quote deviation, possible hallucination. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 45.2%):

<pre>
1. Eligibility:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants required to have a clinical diagnosis of Multiple Sclerosis, persistent foot drop (lasting a minimum of three months) observed during a 5-minute walk test, stable disease (no change in the Extended Disability Status Score or relapse in previous three months), 5° of passive dorsiflexion and tolerance of functional electrical stimulation.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The eligibility criteria for this trial are relatively broad, including participants with a clinical diagnosis of Multiple Sclerosis and persistent foot drop. However, the criteria also include some exclusions, such as those who do not tolerate functional electrical stimulation or have moderate to severe cognitive impairment. These exclusions may limit the generalizability of the trial's results to the broader population of individuals with Multiple Sclerosis and foot drop.

Score: [3]

1. Recruitment:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Potential participants were screened for eligibility, and written informed consent was gained prior to randomization.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The recruitment process for this trial is not explicitly described in the provided text. However, it is mentioned that potential participants were screened for eligibility and provided written informed consent prior to randomization. This suggests that the recruitment process may have been relatively standard, without the use of targeted invitation letters, advertising, or incentives.

Score: [4]

1. Setting:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Seven Multiple Sclerosis outpatient centres across Scotland.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial was conducted across seven Multiple Sclerosis outpatient centres in Scotland, which suggests that the setting is representative of the usual care setting for individuals with Multiple Sclerosis. However, the use of multiple centres may introduce some variability in the setting, which could impact the generalizability of the trial's results.

Score: [4]

1. Organization:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants randomized to the usual care group were fitted with a custom-made, solid, ankle-foot orthosis by an orthotist, within four weeks of their initial assessment. The recommendations made by the Best Practice Statement for ankle-foot orthoses following stroke were applied.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial's usual care group received a custom-made ankle-foot orthosis fitted by an orthotist, which is consistent with the usual care for individuals with foot drop. However, the use of a specific best practice statement for stroke patients may introduce some differences in the organization of care compared to the usual care setting for individuals with Multiple Sclerosis.

Score: [4]

1. Flexibility (delivery):
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants in both groups were instructed to gradually increase the wear of their devices over the first six weeks.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial allowed for some flexibility in the delivery of the interventions, with participants instructed to gradually increase the wear of their devices over the first six weeks. However, the use of a strict protocol for functional electrical stimulation and the monitoring of compliance may limit the flexibility of the intervention compared to the usual care setting.

Score: [3]

1. Flexibility (adherence):
Quote: <span title='Major quote deviation, possible hallucination. Best match in prompt (Similarity 51.4%):

herence, and measures to improve adherence' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed #2780e3; color: #2780e3; background-color: red'>&quot;There were no specific measures to improve adherence to the interventions.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial did not include specific measures to improve adherence to the interventions, which suggests that the flexibility in adherence is similar to the usual care setting. However, the use of a strict protocol for functional electrical stimulation and the monitoring of compliance may limit the flexibility of the intervention compared to the usual care setting.

Score: [4]

1. Follow-up:
Quote: <span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 99.5%):

Outcome measures were administered by two unblinded assessors (Rebecca Hunter and A.L.) at baseline (0), 3, 6 and 12 months, except for the Psychological Impact of Assistive Devices Score 15 which was administered at 12 months only.' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;Outcome measures were administered by two unblinded assessors at baseline (0), 3, 6, and 12 months, except for the Psychological Impact of Assistive Devices Score which was administered at 12 months only.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial included follow-up assessments at multiple time points, which is consistent with the usual care setting. However, the use of unblinded assessors and the inclusion of additional assessments beyond the usual care setting may introduce some differences in the intensity of follow-up.

Score: [4]

1. Primary outcome:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The primary outcome was walking speed as measured by the 5-minute self-selected walk test.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The primary outcome of the trial is walking speed, which is a relevant and important outcome for individuals with foot drop. However, the use of a specific walking test may introduce some differences in the measurement of the outcome compared to the usual care setting.

Score: [4]

1. Primary analysis:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;A Restricted Maximum Likelihood approach to fitting mixed models was employed to allow intention to treat assumptions to cope with missing data.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial employed an intention-to-treat analysis, which is consistent with the usual care setting. However, the use of a specific statistical approach to handle missing data may introduce some differences in the analysis compared to the usual care setting.

<pre>
1. Eligibility:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants were non-institutionalized adults (age ⩾ 18 years) with severe MS and their primary carers. Other patient inclusion criteria were primary or secondary progressive MS, Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score ⩾ 8.0, complex symptoms, and ⩾2 unmet care needs.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial includes participants with severe MS, which is a common condition in usual care. The inclusion criteria are not overly restrictive, and the trial includes patients with both primary and secondary progressive MS. The EDSS score ⩾ 8.0 indicates a high level of disability, which is also common in usual care. The requirement for ⩾2 unmet care needs is a pragmatic criterion that reflects the needs of patients in usual care.

Score: [4]

1. Recruitment:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Dyads were randomly assigned (2:1) to receive HPA or UC. Allocation to treatment groups was done using a third-party, web-based computerized randomization procedure with stratified minimization for EDSS score (8.0–8.5, 9.0–9.5), presence of severe cognitive compromise (clinical judgment), and center (Online Supplementary Table 1).&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial uses a randomization procedure to assign participants to treatment groups, which is a common practice in usual care. The recruitment process does not involve targeted invitation letters, advertising, or incentives, which are often used in explanatory trials.

Score: [4]

1. Setting:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;In this randomized, examiner-blind, controlled study, we recruited patients from three Italian centers.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial is conducted in three Italian centers, which is a pragmatic setting that reflects the usual care environment. The trial does not take place in a single, specialized trial or academic center, which would be more explanatory.

Score: [4]

1. Organization:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Based on the principles of PC, each center had a HPA team consisting of a physician (neurologist or physiatrist), a nurse (case manager and team leader), a psychologist, and a social worker. Nurses of the Milan and Rome centers had degrees and worked full time in PC; the Catania nurse attended a week-long individual training course.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial uses a multidisciplinary team approach, which is common in usual care. The team members have relevant expertise and are trained in PC, which is also common in usual care. The trial does not increase staff levels, give additional training, or require more than usual experience or certification, which would be more explanatory.

Score: [4]

1. Flexibility (delivery):
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;After a comprehensive assessment of the dyad needs based on direct observation and on visit 1 information (available via the eCRF), the HPA team defined the contents of the intervention, involving the dyad and the patient caring physician (the intervention was not intended to replace existing services). Subsequently, the team verified program implementation and reviewed it as necessary.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial allows for flexibility in the delivery of the intervention, which is a pragmatic approach. The intervention is tailored to the needs of each dyad, and the team verifies and reviews the program implementation as necessary. The trial does not use a strict protocol, monitoring, or measures to improve compliance, which would be more explanatory.

Score: [4]

1. Flexibility (adherence):
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The team was not on call for dyads: in the event of emergencies, dyads contacted the patient caring physician or emergency medical services.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial does not exclude participants based on adherence or use measures to improve adherence if found wanting, which would be more explanatory. The trial allows for flexibility in adherence, which is a pragmatic approach.

Score: [5]

1. Follow-up:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;A blind examiner assessed dyads at baseline, 3 months, and 6 months.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial uses a follow-up schedule that is similar to usual care, with assessments at baseline, 3 months, and 6 months. The trial does not use more frequent, longer visits, unscheduled visits triggered by primary outcome event or intervening event, or more extensive data collection, which would be more explanatory.

Score: [4]

1. Primary outcome:
Quote: <span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 99.3%):

The pre-specified primary endpoints were changes in patient quality of life (SEIQoL-DW) and symptom burden (PC Outcome Scale-Symptoms-MS, POSS-MS).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;The pre-specified primary endpoints were changes in patient quality of life (SEIQoL-DW) and symptom burden (PC Outcome Scale-Symptoms-MS, POS-S-MS).&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial uses a primary outcome that is relevant to participants, which is a pragmatic approach. The trial measures changes in patient quality of life and symptom burden, which are important outcomes for patients with severe MS. The trial does not use a surrogate, physiological outcome, central adjudication, or use assessment expertise that is not available in usual care, which would be more explanatory.

Score: [5]

1. Primary analysis:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;All randomly assigned patients were included in the main intention-to-treat analysis, provided that at least one contact with the team occurred (HPA group).&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial uses an intention-to-treat analysis with all available data, which is a pragmatic approach. The trial does not exclude ineligible post-randomization participants, include only completers, or those following the treatment protocol, which would be more explanatory.

<pre>
1. Eligibility:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The main inclusion criteria were: (1) clinically definite MS diagnosis, (2) fatigue impacting on daily life (Fatigue Severity Scale total score >4) (16) and (3) ambulatory.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: The trial has relatively broad inclusion criteria, including all patients with a clinically definite MS diagnosis and fatigue impacting daily life. The only exclusion criteria mentioned are related to cognitive impairments, recent relapse, or recent changes in medication. This suggests a pragmatic approach to participant selection.
Score: [4]

1. Recruitment:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants were recruited in three UK centres (Poole, Bristol, Southampton/Portsmouth) from primary or secondary care, or via MS Society newsletters/websites.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: The trial recruited participants from various sources, including primary and secondary care settings and MS Society newsletters/websites. This suggests a pragmatic approach to recruitment, as it reflects the usual care settings where patients with MS would be identified and engaged.
Score: [4]

1. Setting:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;FACETS was delivered in hotel meeting-room facilities, with the exception of one centre, where it was held in a rehabilitation hospital.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: The trial was conducted in settings that are similar to those where patients with MS would typically receive care, such as rehabilitation hospitals and hotel meeting-room facilities. This suggests a pragmatic approach to the trial setting.
Score: [4]

1. Organization:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Facilitators were all qualified to a senior/advanced level (in the UK minimum of a Band 7 on the NHS Agenda for Change (AfC) grading structure). (17) Facilitators were trained to deliver the intervention at 1-day workshops and psychological advice and debriefing were available for facilitators throughout the trial.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: The trial used health professionals with experience in managing MS and group-work, who were trained to deliver the intervention. This suggests a pragmatic approach to the organization of care delivery, as it reflects the usual care setting where patients with MS would receive care from experienced health professionals.
Score: [4]

1. Flexibility (delivery):
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The intervention is highly structured. Each session follows the same general format, namely, facilitator-delivered presentations, flipchart discussions, group activities and homework.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: The trial used a highly structured intervention with a specific format for each session. This suggests a more explanatory approach to the flexibility of intervention delivery, as it may not reflect the usual care setting where interventions may be delivered with more flexibility.
Score: [2]

1. Flexibility (adherence):
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The reasons for non-attendance are reported in figure 1.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: The trial does not provide specific information on the flexibility of participant adherence to the intervention. However, the fact that non-attendance is reported suggests that there may have been some flexibility in this regard.
Score: [NA]

1. Follow-up:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;All questionnaire outcomes were self-reported for both groups, presented in a booklet format with a large font and administered and returned through the post. This meant that participants could pace the completion of the outcome measures in their own homes.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: The trial used self-reported outcome measures that were administered through the post, allowing participants to complete them at their own pace. This suggests a pragmatic approach to follow-up, as it reflects the usual care setting where patients with MS may be asked to complete outcome measures at home.
Score: [4]

1. Primary outcome:
Quote: <span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 99%):

Primary outcome measures These were: (1) fatigue severity (Global Fatigue Severity (GFS) subscale of the Fatigue Assessment Instrument (FAI)), 18 (2) disease-specific quality of life (QOL) (total score on the Multiple Sclerosis Impact Scale, V.1 (MSIS-29, V.1)) 19 and (3) self-efficacy for managing fatigue (Multiple Sclerosis-Fatigue Self-Efficacy scale—adapted from the Control subscale of the MS Self-Efficacy scale). 20' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;Primary outcomes were fatigue severity (Global Fatigue Severity (GFS) subscale of the Fatigue Assessment Instrument (FAI)), (18) disease-specific quality of life (QOL) (total score on the Multiple Sclerosis Impact Scale, V.1 (MSIS-29, V.1)) (19) and self-efficacy for managing fatigue (Multiple Sclerosis-Fatigue Self-Efficacy scale—adapted from the Control subscale of the MS Self-Efficacy scale). (20)&quot;</span>
Reasoning: The trial used primary outcomes that are relevant to patients with MS, including fatigue severity, disease-specific quality of life, and self-efficacy for managing fatigue. This suggests a pragmatic approach to the choice of primary outcome, as it reflects the outcomes that are important to patients with MS.
Score: [5]

1. Primary analysis:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The main analysis was intention-to-treat but we also conducted a ‘per protocol’ analysis (excluding participants who attended fewer than four FACETS sessions).&quot;</span>
Reasoning: The trial used an intention-to-treat analysis, which is a pragmatic approach to data analysis that includes all randomized participants in the analysis. However, the trial also conducted a per-protocol analysis, which is a more explanatory approach that excludes participants who did not adhere to the intervention protocol.

1. Eligibility:
Quote: <span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 99.8%):

Thirty-five adults were randomly assigned to one of the three groups: a Mindfulness-Based Intervention group (N = 12), Implementation Intention group (N = 11), and a Control Group (N = 12). All the groups received the same Physical Activity program. The Mindfulness condition group received daily training in the form of prerecorded sessions while the Implementation group elaborated their specific plans once a week.' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;Thirty-five adults were randomly assigned to one of the three groups: a Mindfulness-Based Intervention group (N = 12), Implementation Intention group (N = 11), and a Control Group (N = 12). All the groups received the same Physical Activity program. The Mindfulness condition group received daily training in the form of pre-recorded sessions while the Implementation group elaborated their specific plans once a week.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial includes participants with a diagnosis of MS, not currently engaged in rehabilitation, therapy or PA program, aged between 18 and 65, and able to give informed consent and understand French. The exclusion criteria are limited to those who were receiving drug treatment for fatigue started less than three months ago or acute hospital or nursing home, those who were having psychiatric disorders, and those who were not meeting recommended levels of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity. The eligibility criteria are similar to those used in usual care, making the trial pragmatic.

Score: [5]

1. Recruitment:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants were recruited from two hospitals in the Parisian region, in France receiving outpatient services for MS at a regional medical center.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial recruited participants from hospitals in the Parisian region, which is a usual care setting. The recruitment process is not described in detail, but it appears to be similar to usual care.

Score: [5]

1. Setting:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;This clinical and multicentric trial took place from July 2017 to January 2020, in two hospitals in the Parisian Region, France (Hospitals – CHI Poissy St Germain-en-Laye and R. Poincaré, Garches).&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial took place in two hospitals in the Parisian region, which is a usual care setting. The trial was conducted in a multicenter setting, which is also common in usual care.

Score: [5]

1. Organization:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The procedures for this study were approved by research ethics committees (CPP) «Ile de France XI » (ID: 2016-A00537-44), authorized from The National Agency for the Safety of Medicines and Health (ASNM) and registered under the identification number ID: NCT03785483.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial was approved by research ethics committees and authorized by the National Agency for the Safety of Medicines and Health. The trial was registered under a clinical trial identification number, indicating that it was conducted according to standard research protocols. However, the trial did not specify whether the resources, provider expertise, and the organization of care delivery in the intervention arm were identical to those available in usual care.

Score: [3]

1. Flexibility (delivery):
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Mindfulness-Based Intervention group (MBI) (n = 12) received daily Mindfulness training in the form of prerecorded sessions (6 sessions of 10 minutes each equal to one hour/day) using TailorBuilder (TB) application, aiming at developing awareness of emotions and sensations. Mindfulness practice took place individually at home six times per week, without any assistance.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial used a prerecorded mindfulness intervention, which allowed for flexibility in delivery. Participants could practice the intervention at home, without any assistance. However, the trial did not specify whether there was a strict protocol, monitoring, and measures to improve compliance, with specific advice on allowed co-interventions and complications.

Score: [4]

1. Flexibility (adherence):
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants were asked to listen to the prerecorded sessions and to follow the instructions (e.g., Breathing rhythm, number of steps during walking exercises, speed of execution of the movement). Participants also received a weekly telephone call lasted up to 15 min, during which a detailed report concerning the session(s) was reviewed and adapted if required.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial allowed for flexibility in adherence, as participants could practice the intervention at home, without any assistance. Participants received weekly telephone calls to review their progress and adapt the intervention if required. However, the trial did not specify whether there were exclusion based on adherence, and measures to improve adherence if found wanting.

Score: [4]

1. Follow-up:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Two measurement times are carried out in pre-post intervention, at baseline and after eight weeks.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial had a follow-up period of eight weeks, which is similar to usual care. The trial did not specify whether there were more frequent, longer visits, unscheduled visits triggered by primary outcome event or intervening event, and more extensive data collection.

Score: [5]

1. Primary outcome:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Mobility, fatigue, and the impact of the disease on the patient’s life were measured.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial measured mobility, fatigue, and the impact of the disease on the patient’s life, which are relevant to participants. The trial did not use a surrogate, physiological outcome, central adjudication, or use assessment expertise that is not available in usual care, or the outcome was measured at an earlier time than in usual care.

Score: [5]

1. Primary analysis:
Quote: <span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 99.7%):

the Kruskal-Wallis test was used to analyze the homogeneity of groups in relation to sociodemographic characteristics.

Patients who had received hippotherapy within the last 12 months, a body weight over 90 kg, no balance while sitting, and acute exacerbation during the 4-week period before start of the therapy were excluded.&quot;</span>
* Explanation: The trial has some exclusion criteria, such as patients who had received hippotherapy within the last 12 months, a body weight over 90 kg, no balance while sitting, and acute exacerbation during the 4-week period before start of the therapy. However, these criteria are not overly restrictive and are likely to be similar to those used in usual care.

1. Eligibility:
   - Quote 1: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants eligible for inclusion were adults aged over 15 years with one of the following possible recorded diagnoses: MS, PD and other causes of progressive parkinsonism, motor neurone disease, Huntington's disease and other degenerative disorders affecting the central nervous system, muscles or peripheral nerves.&quot;</span>
   - Quote 2: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;In order to preserve a focus on primarily physical disabilities, dementing disorders such as Alzheimer's disease were not included.&quot;</span>
   - Quote 3: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants whose clinical features appeared incompatible with the recorded diagnosis were excluded, as were those with neurological complications of primarily non-neurological conditions such as diabetes mellitus, or additional causes of severe disability.&quot;</span>

   Reasoning: The trial includes participants with a range of progressive neurological conditions, which is representative of the population that would receive the intervention in usual care. However, the exclusion of participants with dementing disorders and neurological complications of primarily non-neurological conditions may limit the generalizability of the trial's results to the broader population.

   Score: [3]

2. Recruitment:
   - Quote 1: <span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 99.1%):

From July 1998 we approached the 177 GPs based within the City of Nottingham boundaries (population 282000).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;From July 1998 we approached the 177 GPs based within the City of Nottingham boundaries (population 282,000).&quot;</span>
   - Quote 2: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;We searched practice diagnostic lists and prescription records and made intensive enquiries for additional patients from individual GPs.&quot;</span>
   - Quote 3: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;To avoid ascertainment bias towards people already receiving specific health or social services, we used GP information as the sole method for identifying potential participants.&quot;</span>

   Reasoning: The trial recruited participants through their general practitioners, which is a common method of recruitment in usual care. However, the intensive enquiries made for additional patients may not be representative of the usual care setting.

   Score: [4]

3. Setting:
   - Quote 1: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Setting: Participants' homes in the City of Nottingham.&quot;</span>

   Reasoning: The trial was conducted in participants' homes, which is the same setting as where the intervention would be delivered in usual care.

   Score: [5]

4. Organization:
   - Quote 1: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;In the education group (EG), baseline data were reviewed by an expert panel which advised on actions most likely to promote each individual's physical, social and psychological well-being.&quot;</span>
   - Quote 2: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;An occupational therapist (OT) then visited EG participants to provide education and information and to discuss a personalized 12-month health action plan.&quot;</span>

   Reasoning: The trial involved an expert panel and an occupational therapist to deliver the intervention, which may not be available in all usual care settings. However, the use of a personalized health action plan is representative of usual care.

   Score: [3]

5. Flexibility (delivery):
   - Quote 1: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Within six weeks of the baseline visit, participants in the EG received an education visit from the research OT, who provided personalized advice and information based on the expert panel discussion, a tailored version of the standard information package, and a specially constructed leaflet offering information about the participant's condition and about self-help organizations.&quot;</span>

   Reasoning: The trial allowed for flexibility in the delivery of the intervention by providing personalized advice and information based on the expert panel discussion. However, the use of a standard information package and a specially constructed leaflet may not be representative of usual care.

   Score: [3]

6. Flexibility (adherence):
   - Quote 1: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;EG participants received a single follow-through phone call from the research OT to confirm and reinforce the educational content of the visit, after which EG patients had no subsequent contact with the OT.&quot;</span>

   Reasoning: The trial allowed for some flexibility in adherence by providing a follow-up phone call to reinforce the educational content of the visit. However, the lack of subsequent contact with the occupational therapist may not be representative of usual care.

   Score: [3]

7. Follow-up:
   - Quote 1: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants were assessed at baseline and 12 months later.&quot;</span>

   Reasoning: The trial had a follow-up period of 12 months, which is longer than the usual follow-up period in usual care.

   Score: [2]

8. Primary outcome:
   - Quote 1: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Primary outcome measures were reports of one or more falls or skin sores.&quot;</span>

   Reasoning: The trial's primary outcome measures are relevant to participants and are commonly used in usual care.

   Score: [5]

9. Primary analysis:
   - Quote 1: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;For binary outcomes univariate and multivariate logistic regression were performed. Analyses were performed both with and without adjustment for baseline rates of events in the groups.&quot;</span>

   Reasoning: The trial used appropriate statistical methods for the analysis of the primary outcome, including adjustment for baseline rates of events.

1. Eligibility:
Quote: <span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 98.7%):

Eligible participants were male 35–65 yr old with a BMI of Q28 kgIm j2 and met PA safety requirements (i.e., no risk indicated by the Physical Activity Readiness Questionnaire [36] or clearance from a health care provider).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;Eligible participants were male 35–65 yr old with a BMI of Q28 kgIm^(−2) and met PA safety requirements (i.e., no risk indicated by the Physical Activity Readiness Questionnaire [36] or clearance from a health care provider).&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The eligibility criteria for this trial are relatively broad, including males aged 35-65 with a BMI of 28 or higher and no significant risks for physical activity. This aligns with the usual care setting, as these criteria would be used to identify individuals who could benefit from a weight loss and healthy lifestyle program.

Score: [4]

1. Recruitment:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Recruitment occurred using a variety of methods (e.g., hockey team e-mail blasts and social media accounts, study website, posters, traditional media advertisements, word of mouth, direct contact at team arena).&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The recruitment methods used in this trial are similar to those that would be used in a usual care setting, such as word of mouth, advertisements, and direct contact. This suggests a pragmatic approach to recruitment.

Score: [4]

1. Setting:
Quote: <span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 99.3%):

We used a pragmatic approach for the program venue at each site, using a combination of the hockey team_s arena and an affiliated health club facility.' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;We used a pragmatic approach for the program venue at each site, using a combination of the hockey team’s arena and an affiliated health club facility.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial was conducted in settings that are similar to those where the intervention would be delivered in usual care, such as hockey arenas and health club facilities. This suggests a pragmatic approach to the setting.

Score: [5]

1. Organization:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Program sessions comprised the following: 1) classroom-based teaching of behavior change techniques and simple information sharing on PA and healthy eating, delivered to encourage participant interaction and mutual learning, and 2) exercise sessions where men performed aerobic, strength, and flexibility exercises, incorporating their passion for hockey off the ice.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The organization of the trial intervention appears to be similar to what would be used in usual care, with a focus on behavior change techniques, information sharing, and exercise sessions. However, the use of hockey-related exercises may not be typical in usual care, which suggests a more explanatory approach.

Score: [3]

1. Flexibility (delivery):
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Sessions were designed to appeal to men; they included elements of friendly competition and encouraged banter, humor, and peer support.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial intervention appears to have some flexibility in its delivery, with a focus on appealing to men and incorporating elements of friendly competition and peer support. However, the use of specific exercises and activities may not be as flexible as what would be seen in usual care.

Score: [3]

1. Flexibility (adherence):
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;There were 10 men in the intervention group who were classified as ‘‘noncompleters’’ (i.e., attended G50% of sessions including none in the final 6 wk), but this did not preclude them from attending follow-up measurement sessions.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial allowed for some flexibility in adherence, as noncompleters were still allowed to attend follow-up measurement sessions. However, the use of specific exercises and activities may not be as flexible as what would be seen in usual care.

Score: [3]

1. Follow-up:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Follow-up occurred at 12 wk (both groups) and 12 months (intervention group only to explore the sustainability of long-term change).&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial had a follow-up period of 12 weeks for both groups and an additional 12-month follow-up for the intervention group. This is similar to what would be seen in usual care, where follow-up is used to assess the long-term effects of an intervention.

Score: [5]

1. Primary outcome:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The planned primary outcome for the definitive trial was the difference between groups in mean weight loss (kg) and percentage weight change from baseline to 12 wk.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The primary outcome of the trial was weight loss, which is a relevant and important outcome for participants. This aligns with the usual care setting, where weight loss is often a primary goal of interventions.

Score: [5]

1. Primary analysis:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;We analyzed outcome data to examine the potential effectiveness of the Hockey FIT program on the basis of an intent-to-treat approach.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial used an intent-to-treat analysis, which is a pragmatic approach that includes all randomized participants in the analysis, regardless of whether they completed the intervention or not. This aligns with the usual care setting, where the goal is to assess the effectiveness of an intervention in real-world conditions.

1. Eligibility:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The pregnant women were randomly divided into three groups at a university hospital in the suburbs of Sao Paulo, Brazil, in order to receive either acupressure treatment, a placebo or participate as part of a control group.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial includes pregnant women in labor with cervical dilations of ≥ 4 cm and with two or more contractions in 10 minutes, which is similar to the usual care setting. However, the trial excludes those with serious preeclampsia, placenta previa, immediate indication of cesarean, dilations at ≥ 8 cm, and those who used analgesics for less than six hours from the study admission time. These exclusion criteria make the trial more explanatory than pragmatic.

Score: [2]

1. Recruitment:
Quote: <span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 95.8%):

Reasoning: The recruitment process involves random allocation of participants, which is similar to the usual care setting. However, the trial does not mention any additional efforts to recruit participants, such as targeted invitation letters or advertising, making it more pragmatic than explanatory.

Score: [4]

1. Setting:
Quote: <span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 95.4%):

was carried out between January and August of 2013. The subjects were pregnant women admitted to a teaching tertiary public hospital on the outskirts of the state of Sao Paulo, Brazil.' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;The study was carried out between January and August of 2013. The subjects were pregnant women admitted to a teaching tertiary public hospital on the outskirts of the state of Sao Paulo, Brazil.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial was conducted in a single center, which is a teaching tertiary public hospital. This setting is not identical to the usual care setting, making the trial more explanatory than pragmatic.

Score: [2]

1. Organization:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The researcher that was responsible for applying the acupressure went through 32 hours’ worth of training.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial involves additional training for the researcher responsible for applying acupressure, which is not typically available in the usual care setting. This makes the trial more explanatory than pragmatic.

Score: [2]

1. Flexibility (delivery):
Quote: <span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 99.7%):

The SP6 group with the pregnant women in labor received deep pressure (± 5kg) with fast decompression applied to their thumbs which did not bring about any discomfort. The TG group received a superficial touch that was of very low intensity (± 100g) (15) . In both groups the contact was at the SP6 bilateral point, during the contractions, in one period of 20 minutes.' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;The SP6 group with the pregnant women in labor received deep pressure (± 5kg) with fast decompression applied to their thumbs which did not bring about any discomfort. The TG group received a superficial touch that was of very low intensity (± 100g). In both groups, the contact was at the SP6 bilateral point, during the contractions, in one period of 20 minutes.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial specifies the type and duration of the intervention, which is less flexible than the usual care setting. However, the trial does not mention any strict protocol or measures to improve compliance, making it more pragmatic than explanatory.

Score: [3]

1. Flexibility (adherence):
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The pregnant women in labor obtained normal obstetrical treatment. Where the study was carried out, the following was permitted: the presence of someone to accompany the pregnant lady, the use of methods other than drugs such as taking a shower, massages in the lower back region and breathing exercises as well as liberty of movement (in cases where this did not go against medical advice).&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial allows for normal obstetrical treatment and permits the use of methods other than drugs, which is similar to the usual care setting. However, the trial does not mention any measures to improve adherence, making it more pragmatic than explanatory.

Score: [4]

1. Follow-up:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The VAS was used and reused immediately after the treatment (VAS20) and 60 minutes after the treatment, once consent had been given by the pregnant women in labor to participate in the study.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial involves follow-up assessments immediately after the treatment and 60 minutes after the treatment, which is more frequent than the usual care setting. However, the trial does not mention any unscheduled visits triggered by primary outcome events or intervening events, making it more pragmatic than explanatory.

Score: [3]

1. Primary outcome:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The averages for the pain measured using the VAS were not different for the three groups that were a part of the study (p-value=0.0929), however they were less in the acupressure groups immediately after receiving the treatment (p-value=<0.0001). This was also the case where the treatment lasted for 1 hour (p-value=0.0001). This was the case in comparison with placebo and control groups.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial measures pain using the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), which is a relevant outcome for participants. However, the trial does not use a surrogate or physiological outcome, central adjudication, or assessment expertise that is not available in usual care, making it more pragmatic than explanatory.

Score: [4]

1. Primary analysis:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The Kruskal-Wallis test was used to make comparisons between the groups in relation to quantitative variables. The Mann-Whitney test was used in cases where significant differences were found for multiple comparisons. The Chi-squared test was used in relation to the association between groups and variables categories. The Exact Fisher test was used in cases where there were at least 20% of the expected values being less than five.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial uses intention-to-treat analysis with all available data, which is a pragmatic approach. However, the trial does not mention any exclusion of ineligible post-randomization participants or inclusion of only completers or those following the treatment protocol, making it more pragmatic than explanatory.

<pre>
1. Eligibility:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Patients, 45-65 years old, with mild and moderate chronic obstructive pulmonary disease were invited with a family member.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: The trial included patients with mild and moderate COPD, which is a common inclusion criterion in clinical practice. The age range is also representative of the typical age group affected by COPD. However, the trial excluded patients with other major diseases, non-Icelandic speaking patients, and those who had participated in a structured rehabilitation program for people with COPD 6 months prior to the screening. These exclusion criteria may limit the generalizability of the trial's findings to the broader COPD population.
Score: [3]
2. Recruitment:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Patients were recruited from each of the primary health care centres and lung physicians’ offices.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: The trial recruited patients from primary health care centers and lung physicians' offices, which is a common recruitment strategy in clinical practice. However, the trial did not provide details on the recruitment methods used, such as targeted invitation letters, advertising in newspapers, or incentives, which could have influenced the trial's pragmatic score.
Score: [3]
3. Setting:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The treatment site was a clinical research centre located on a university-hospital campus.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: The trial was conducted in a clinical research center located on a university-hospital campus, which may not be representative of the typical clinical setting where COPD patients receive care. This setting could have influenced the trial's pragmatic score.
Score: [2]
4. Organization:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The intervention was provided for 6 months with a subsequent follow-up for additional 6 months.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: The trial provided the intervention for 6 months, which is a relatively short duration compared to the typical chronic management of COPD. The trial did not provide details on the resources, provider expertise, and the organization of care delivery in the intervention arm of the trial, which could have influenced the trial's pragmatic score.
Score: [3]
5. Flexibility (delivery):
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The theoretical framework, Partnership with people with COPD and their families, was the basis for this intervention.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: The trial used a theoretical framework to guide the intervention, which may not be representative of the typical clinical practice. However, the trial did not provide details on the flexibility in how the intervention was delivered, which could have influenced the trial's pragmatic score.
Score: [3]
6. Flexibility (adherence):
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Patients in the experimental group did not have better health-related quality of life, less anxiety or depression, increased physical activity, fewer exacerbations or better smoking status than patients in the control group.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: The trial did not provide details on the flexibility in how participants must adhere to the intervention, which could have influenced the trial's pragmatic score. However, the trial did not report any exclusion based on adherence or measures to improve adherence if found wanting.

7. Follow-up:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Data were collected at baseline and at month 12. Additionally, data collection was carried out in the experimental group at month 6 after the last treatment session.&quot;</span>
Reasoning: The trial followed up with participants at baseline, month 6, and month 12, which is a relatively short follow-up period compared to the typical chronic management of COPD. The trial did not provide details on the intensity of measurement and follow-up of participants in the trial and the likely follow-up in usual care, which could have influenced the trial's pragmatic score.
Score: [3]
8. Primary outcome:

<pre>
1. Eligibility:
   - Quote: <span title='Major quote deviation, possible hallucination. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 67.4%):

From their computerised asthma registers the practices identified adults (>18 years) who had asked for a bronchodilator inhaler prescription in the previDepartment' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: red'>&quot;From their computerised asthma registers the practices identified adults (>18 years) who had asked for a bronchodilator inhaler prescription in the previous six months but who had not had a routine asthma review in the preceding 11 months.&quot;</span>
   - Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Patients were excluded if the diagnosis of asthma had been made within the previous year, if they had chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, if communication difficulties made a telephone consultation impossible, or (at the general practitioner’s request) for major social or medical reasons.&quot;</span>
   - Reasoning: The trial includes adults with asthma who have not been reviewed in the past 11 months, which is similar to the usual care population. However, there are some exclusion criteria, such as communication difficulties and specific medical conditions, which may limit the generalizability of the results.
   - Score: [3]

2. Recruitment:
   - Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;We wrote to all eligible patients inviting them to take part in the study.&quot;</span>
   - Reasoning: The trial uses a simple invitation letter to recruit participants, which is similar to the usual care setting. However, the lack of additional recruitment efforts, such as targeted advertisements or incentives, suggests a more pragmatic approach.
   - Score: [4]

3. Setting:
   - Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Four general practices in England.&quot;</span>
   - Reasoning: The trial is conducted in general practices, which is the same setting as usual care for asthma patients. This suggests a pragmatic approach.
   - Score: [5]

4. Organisation:
   - Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Nurses were told to make up to four attempts to contact the patient by phone.&quot;</span>
   - Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Nurses were given no instructions about the content of the review except that it should reflect their normal practice and be appropriate to each patient’s clinical need.&quot;</span>
   - Reasoning: The trial allows nurses to use their usual practice and resources, with minimal additional training or support. This suggests a pragmatic approach.
   - Score: [5]

5. Flexibility (delivery):
   - Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Nurses arranged any follow-up consultations (whether in the surgery or by telephone) they deemed clinically necessary.&quot;</span>
   - Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Patients were free to arrange any consultations they wished.&quot;</span>
   - Reasoning: The trial allows for flexibility in the delivery of the intervention, with nurses and patients able to choose the most appropriate follow-up consultations. This suggests a pragmatic approach.
   - Score: [5]

6. Flexibility (adherence):
   - Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Nurses were given no instructions about the content of the review except that it should reflect their normal practice and be appropriate to each patient’s clinical need.&quot;</span>
   - Reasoning: The trial does not impose strict protocols or measures to improve adherence, allowing for flexibility in the intervention. This suggests a pragmatic approach.
   - Score: [5]

7. Follow-up:
   - Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Primary outcome measures were the proportion of patients reviewed within three months of randomisation and change in asthma related quality of life, as measured by the Juniper mini asthma quality of life questionnaire.&quot;</span>
   - Reasoning: The trial measures outcomes at three months, which is similar to the usual care setting. However, the use of a specific questionnaire may suggest a more explanatory approach.
   - Score: [4]

8. Primary outcome:
   - Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Primary outcome measures were the proportion of patients reviewed within three months of randomisation and change in asthma related quality of life, as measured by the Juniper mini asthma quality of life questionnaire.&quot;</span>

1. Eligibility:
* Relevant quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The inclusion criteria were: a positive diagnosis of RA (1987 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria), age 18 years or older and the ability to complete questionnaires unaided. Exclusions were: unstabilised concomitant disease, awaiting surgery and already receiving care from the practitioners involved in the study.&quot;</span>
* Reasoning: The eligibility criteria for this trial are quite broad, including only patients with a positive diagnosis of RA, aged 18 or older, and able to complete questionnaires unaided. The exclusion criteria are also limited to those with unstabilised concomitant disease, awaiting surgery, or already receiving care from the practitioners involved in the study. This suggests that the trial is designed to be pragmatic and reflect the usual care setting.

1. Eligibility:
   - Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Patients were eligible for inclusion if they were aged 16 years or older and presented within 3 weeks after sustaining a displaced fracture of the proximal humerus that involved the surgical neck.&quot;</span>
   - Reasoning: The eligibility criteria are broad and inclusive, allowing for a wide range of patients with proximal humeral fractures to be included in the trial. This aligns with the pragmatic approach, as it reflects the diversity of patients seen in usual care.
   - Score: [5]

2. Recruitment:
   - Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Patients received their allocated treatment from the recruiting hospital.&quot;</span>
   - Reasoning: The recruitment process appears to be integrated into the usual care setting, as patients received their treatment from the hospital where they were recruited. This suggests a pragmatic approach to recruitment.
   - Score: [5]

3. Setting:
   - Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The PROFHER collaborators recruited patients for this pragmatic, open, multicenter, parallel-group, superiority, randomized clinical trial between September 2008 and April 2011 from orthopedic departments (fracture clinics or wards) at 32 acute UK National Health Service hospitals.&quot;</span>
   - Reasoning: The trial was conducted in multiple centers, reflecting the usual care setting in the UK National Health Service. This suggests a pragmatic approach to the trial setting.
   - Score: [5]

4. Organization:
   - Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;It was emphasized that good standards of care, both surgical and nonsurgical, should be provided throughout the treatment pathway for the injury, including surgical care or management of the sling, postoperative care, and rehabilitation in both groups.&quot;</span>
   - Reasoning: The trial emphasized the provision of good standards of care, which aligns with the usual care setting. This suggests a pragmatic approach to the organization of care delivery.
   - Score: [5]

5. Flexibility (delivery):
   - Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participating hospitals did not introduce new or experimental interventions for these fractures during the study.&quot;</span>
   - Reasoning: The trial did not introduce new or experimental interventions, suggesting that the flexibility in delivering the interventions was similar to usual care.
   - Score: [5]

6. Flexibility (adherence):
   - Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Of 125 patients allocated to the surgical group, 109 (87%) received surgery and 16 (13%) were treated nonsurgically.&quot;</span>
   - Reasoning: The trial allowed for some flexibility in adherence to the allocated treatment, as not all patients in the surgical group received surgery. This reflects the usual care setting, where patients may choose not to undergo surgery.
   - Score: [5]

7. Follow-up:
   - Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Valid OSS responses were recorded for 232 patients (93%) at 6 months, 225 (90%) at 12 months, and 215 (86%) at 24 months.&quot;</span>
   - Reasoning: The trial had a high follow-up rate, suggesting that the intensity of measurement and follow-up was similar to usual care.
   - Score: [5]

8. Primary outcome:
   - Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The primary outcome was the Oxford Shoulder Score (OSS), which is a shoulder-specific outcome measure validated in a UK population.&quot;</span>
   - Reasoning: The primary outcome, the Oxford Shoulder Score, is a patient-reported outcome measure that is relevant to participants. This aligns with the pragmatic approach.
   - Score: [5]

9. Primary analysis:
   - Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;All analyses were on an intention-to-treat basis and included all randomized patients in the groups to which they were randomized.&quot;</span>
   - Reasoning: The trial used an intention-to-treat analysis, which includes all randomized patients in their allocated groups. This approach is consistent with the pragmatic approach to primary analysis.

1. Eligibility:
Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Practices were recruited with assistance from Primary Care Research Networks for London, Derby, and Nottingham.&quot;</span>
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Patients aged ≥65 years were identified by searches of computerised medical records and invited to participate by letter from their GP.&quot;</span>
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Patients were eligible to participate if they were: [&quot;</span> [...] <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;] independently mobile (with or without a walking aid); and [&quot;</span> [...] <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;] physically able to take part in group exercise.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial includes participants from the target population (patients aged 65 and older) who would receive this intervention in usual care, with the exception of those with certain health conditions. The recruitment process involves searching computerized medical records and inviting patients by letter from their GP, which is a common approach in usual care. The eligibility criteria for mobility and physical ability are also relevant to the usual care setting.

Score: [4]

1. Recruitment:
Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Practices were recruited with assistance from Primary Care Research Networks for London, Derby, and Nottingham.&quot;</span>
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Patients aged ≥65 years were identified by searches of computerised medical records and invited to participate by letter from their GP.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The recruitment process involves identifying patients from computerized medical records and inviting them to participate by letter from their GP, which is a common approach in usual care. The use of Primary Care Research Networks for recruitment does not deviate significantly from usual care practices.

Score: [4]

1. Setting:
Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Attempts were made to exclude those who were already exercising at, or above, the target level through a pre-assessment screening telephone call.&quot;</span>
- <span title='Major quote deviation, possible hallucination. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 74.5%):

Otago Exercise Programme (OEP), 10 and a group-based exercise programme called Falls Management Exercise (FaME).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: red'>&quot;The interventions were the home-based Otago Exercise Program (OEP), and a group-based exercise programme called Falls Management Exercise (FaME).&quot;</span>
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The FaME intervention took place in a group once a week and included exercises to be carried out at home, unsupervised, twice weekly. The OEP was undertaken at home, unsupervised, and comprised exercises to be done three times per week.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial includes both home-based and group-based exercise interventions, which reflect the usual care settings where these interventions might be implemented. Although the trial uses specific exercises and frequencies, they are designed to be carried out in the participants' homes or in local venues, which aligns with the usual care setting.

Score: [4]

1. Organisation:
Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Volunteer peer mentors supported participants in the OEP arm, and weekly FaME classes were run in local venues by postural stability instructors trained to work with older people.&quot;</span>
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Both interventions were delivered for 24 weeks.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial involves the use of volunteer peer mentors and postural stability instructors trained to work with older people, which reflects the resources and expertise that would be available in usual care. The interventions were delivered for 24 weeks, which is a reasonable timeframe for implementing such interventions in usual care.

Score: [4]

1. Flexibility (delivery):
Quotes:
- <span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 98.3%):

OEP — ankle weights and hand holds; and • FaME — resistance bands and hand holds, plus a move to more dynamic balance work and floor work with postural stability instructors.' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;The OEP — ankle weights and hand holds; and FaME — resistance bands and hand holds, plus a move to more dynamic balance work and floor work with postural stability instructors.&quot;</span>
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants in the usual-care arm were not offered either programme.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial specifies the use of ankle weights, resistance bands, and hand holds for the interventions, as well as the involvement of postural stability instructors for more dynamic balance work and floor work. However, these elements are not overly restrictive or prescriptive, and the trial allows for some flexibility in how the interventions are delivered.

Score: [4]

1. Flexibility (adherence):
Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants in the usual-care arm were not offered either programme.&quot;</span>
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Adherence was defined as (minutes spent exercising/intended minutes) 100%, where patients with values exceeding 75% were regarded as ‘adherent’.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial does not provide specific information on measures to improve adherence or exclusion based on adherence. However, it does define adherence and report adherence rates. In some trials, such as this one, where participants are being operated on or receiving IV drug therapy in an ICU, this domain is not applicable as there is no compliance issue after consent has been given.

Score: [NA]

1. Follow-up:
Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants were followed up every 6 months after the end of the intervention period, until 24 months.&quot;</span>
- <span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 98.9%):

The primary time point was chosen as 12 months postintervention to match other trials.' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;The primary time point was chosen as 12 months post-intervention to match other trials.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial includes follow-up assessments every 6 months after the end of the intervention period, up to 24 months. This intensity of measurement and follow-up is not substantially greater than what would be expected in usual care.

Score: [4]

1. Primary outcome:
Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The primary outcome was the proportion of participants who reported reaching ≥150 minutes of MVPA per week.&quot;</span>
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Secondary outcomes included falls, quality of life, balance confidence, and costs.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The primary outcome, which is the proportion of participants reaching 150 minutes of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity per week, is an outcome of obvious importance to participants and is relevant to the intervention. The secondary outcomes are also relevant and important to participants.

Score: [5]

1. Primary analysis:
Quotes:
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants were analysed in the groups to which they were randomised, regardless of whether they received the intervention or not, and multiple imputation was used to include all participants in the analyses.&quot;</span>
- <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Analyses were undertaken without researchers being blind to the treatment arm allocation.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial uses an intention-to-treat analysis, including all participants in the analyses regardless of whether they received the intervention or not, and uses multiple imputation to address missing data. The analysis is not blinded to the treatment arm allocation, but this does not affect the pragmatic nature of the analysis.

1. Eligibility:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants were included who scored >2 on the General Health Questionnaire 12, a measure of psychological distress, or >7 on the anxiety and depression subscales of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, thus confirming they had low mood.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial included participants with low mood, which is a common condition in people with multiple sclerosis. The eligibility criteria are not overly restrictive and are relevant to the usual care setting.

Score: [4]

1. Recruitment:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants were recruited for a randomized trial of adjustment groups for people with multiple sclerosis and low mood between June 2008 and September 2009.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The recruitment process is not described in detail, but it appears that participants were recruited through usual appointments or clinics. There is no mention of targeted invitation letters, advertising, or incentives.

Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The details of this study have been published elsewhere.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The setting of the trial is not explicitly described in the provided text. Therefore, it is not possible to assess this domain.

Score: [NA]

1. Organisation:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The groups were delivered by two Band 5 assistant psychologists, who were supervised by a Band 8a clinical psychologist, experienced in working with people with multiple sclerosis.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial used resources and provider expertise that are available in usual care, such as assistant psychologists and clinical psychologists. The organization of care delivery appears to be similar to usual care.

Score: [4]

1. Flexibility (delivery):
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The groups involved teaching people to recognise symptoms of distress and introduced them to strategies to improve their mood.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial allowed for some flexibility in the delivery of the intervention, as it involved teaching participants to recognize symptoms and improve their mood. However, the intervention was delivered in a structured format, with six group treatment sessions.

Score: [3]

1. Flexibility (adherence):
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants allocated to the control group received all other rehabilitation routinely provided and were offered the opportunity to attend groups once they had completed the study.&quot;</span>

Score: [5]

1. Follow-up:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Four and eight months after random allocation, participants were sent a booklet of outcome questionnaires to complete and return by post.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial used a follow-up period of eight months, which is longer than usual care. However, the intensity of measurement and follow-up was not excessive, as participants were only sent questionnaires to complete.

Score: [3]

1. Primary outcome:
Quote: <span title='Moderate quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 93.6%):

Main measures: Outcomes were assessed four and eight months after randomization, blind to group allocation.' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ff9e81'>&quot;The main measures were outcomes assessed four and eight months after randomization, blind to group allocation.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial used a primary outcome that is relevant to participants, as it assessed mood and quality of life. The outcome was measured at a later time than in usual care, which may make it less pragmatic.

Score: [3]

1. Primary analysis:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The analysis was conducted from the perspective of the UK National Health Service (NHS).&quot;</span>

<pre>
1. Eligibility:
* Quote 1: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The inclusion criteria were being definitely diagnosed with MS and having records in the Society and the exclusion criteria having history of other psychiatric disorders including major depressive disorder (according to the medical records and the physician's examinations) or bipolar disorder (except for cognitive disorders by which MS is characterized), substance dependency, any neurological disorders, history of taking corticosteroids or the disease recurrence within the previous six months.&quot;</span>
* Quote 2: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The study population consists the patients referring to the Multiple Sclerosis Society of Isfahan.&quot;</span>
* Reasoning: The trial included patients with a definite diagnosis of MS and excluded those with other psychiatric disorders, substance dependency, neurological disorders, or recent corticosteroid use. The study population was limited to patients referring to the Multiple Sclerosis Society of Isfahan. These criteria are somewhat restrictive, but still relevant to the usual care setting.
* Score: [3]
1. Recruitment:
* Quote 1: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Because the patients were not hospitalized and regularly referred to the Association, to follow randomized assignment, we decided to run the sampling within two consecutive months until we enrolled an adequate number of participants.&quot;</span>
* Reasoning: The recruitment process involved patients who were not hospitalized and regularly referred to the Association. The sampling was conducted within two consecutive months to enroll an adequate number of participants. This approach is similar to the usual care setting, as it does not involve targeted invitation letters, advertising, or incentives.
* Score: [4]
1. Setting:
* Quote 1: <span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 99.2%):

This clinical trial was conducted in 2015e2016 and registered as IRCT2014112420064N1 in the Iranian Register of Clinical Trials.' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;This clinical trial was conducted in 2015-2016 and registered as IRCT2014112420064N1 in the Iranian Register of Clinical Trials.&quot;</span>
* Reasoning: The trial was conducted in Iran and registered in the Iranian Register of Clinical Trials. The setting is not explicitly described, but it can be assumed that the trial took place in a clinical setting relevant to the usual care setting for MS patients.
* Score: [3]
1. Organization:
* Quote 1: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The intervention was implemented within two days a week. For the control group, a routine protocol was conducted.&quot;</span>
* Reasoning: The intervention was implemented within two days a week, and a routine protocol was conducted for the control group. This suggests that the resources, provider expertise, and organization of care delivery were similar to the usual care setting.
* Score: [4]
1. Flexibility (delivery):
* Quote 1: <span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 99.9%):

The intervention consisted of: defining depression, stress, anxiety, and their symptoms, defining happiness, and explaining its necessity, reviewing the results of previous studies on happiness (the first session); the technique of increasing physical activity, the technique of being productive, and doing useful and meaningful things (the second session); the principles of planning and better organization–the technique of removing concerns, the technique of reducing expectations and wishes (the third session); the technique of enhancing creativity, the technique of living at present (the F. Khayeri et al. / Complementary Therapies in Clinical Practice 25 (2016) 130e135 131 fourth session; the technique of increasing social relationships, the technique of being the real self (the fifth session).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;The intervention consisted of: defining depression, stress, anxiety, and their symptoms, defining happiness, and explaining its necessity, reviewing the results of previous studies on happiness (the first session); the technique of increasing physical activity, the technique of being productive, and doing useful and meaningful things (the second session); the principles of planning and better organization–the technique of removing concerns, the technique of reducing expectations and wishes (the third session); the technique of enhancing creativity, the technique of living at present (the fourth session); the technique of increasing social relationships, the technique of being the real self (the fifth session).&quot;</span>
* Reasoning: The intervention consisted of specific techniques and principles delivered in eight sessions. This suggests a structured protocol with limited flexibility compared to the usual care setting.
* Score: [2]
1. Flexibility (adherence):
* Quote 1: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;At completion of the training program, all happy techniques were briefly reviewed with the participants, the participants were asked some questions about their current happiness and optimism levels, and their questions, if any, were answered.&quot;</span>
* Reasoning: The trial did not explicitly mention measures to improve adherence or exclude participants based on adherence. However, the brief review of techniques and addressing participants' questions suggest some flexibility in adherence.
* Score: [3]
1. Follow-up:
* Quote 1: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Moreover, to investigate the efficacy of the FHM, the DASS-21 and Piper Standard Scale were administered to the experimental group in the follow-up session.&quot;</span>

1. Eligibility:
Quote: <span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 98.8%):

Persons with MS (N ¼ 183) with cognitive concerns were randomly assigned to either the 8week MAPSS-MS intervention or usual care plus freely available computer games.' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;Persons with MS (N = 183) with cognitive concerns were randomly assigned to either the 8-week MAPSS-MS intervention or usual care plus freely available computer games.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial includes participants with cognitive concerns, which is a common issue in MS patients. The exclusion criteria are not explicitly stated, but the trial does not seem to exclude participants based on factors such as compliance, response to treatment, or age. Therefore, the eligibility criteria appear to be pragmatic and similar to those used in usual care.

Score: [4]

1. Recruitment:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Participants were recruited via physician referral, targeted mailings to persons with MS on the mailing list of the National MS Society, contact with support groups, and notices in MS newsletters and web sites.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial uses multiple recruitment methods, including physician referral and targeted mailings, which are common in usual care settings. The trial does not appear to use targeted invitation letters, advertising in newspapers or radio, or incentives, which are more explanatory approaches.

Score: [4]

1. Setting:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The project staff used a script to screen potential participants and explain the study requirements to those who called the toll-free number and met eligibility criteria.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial does not explicitly state the setting, but it appears to be conducted in a usual care setting, such as a clinic or hospital. The use of a toll-free number for screening suggests that the trial is accessible to participants in their usual care setting.

Score: [4]

1. Organization:
Quote: <span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 99.5%):

The intervention includes group sessions (2 h per week for 8 weeks) focused on building efficacy for use of cognitive strategies and a home-based computer training program (45 min three times per week).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;The intervention included group sessions (2 h per week for 8 weeks) focused on building efficacy for use of cognitive strategies and a home-based computer training program (45 min three times per week).&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial uses a combination of group sessions and home-based computer training, which is similar to usual care settings. The trial does not appear to increase staff levels, give additional training, or require more than usual experience or certification.

Score: [4]

1. Flexibility (delivery):
Quote: <span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 99.1%):

The computer component enabled participants (N ¼ 63) to engage in practice sessions without leaving their homes.' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;The computer component enabled participants (N = 63) to engage in practice sessions without leaving their homes.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial allows for flexibility in the delivery of the intervention, as participants can engage in practice sessions at home. The trial does not appear to have a strict protocol, monitoring, or measures to improve compliance.

Score: [4]

1. Flexibility (adherence):
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Although individuals varied their computer training time from week to week, 68% met or exceeded the total time prescribed over the 8-week intervention.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial allows for flexibility in adherence to the intervention, as participants can vary their computer training time from week to week. The trial does not appear to exclude participants based on adherence or use measures to improve adherence if found wanting.

Score: [4]

1. Follow-up:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Neuropsychological testing and questionnaire data were collected from all subjects at baseline, following completion of the intervention, and 3 and 6 months post-intervention.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial has a pragmatic approach to follow-up, with data collection at baseline, post-intervention, and 3 and 6 months post-intervention. The trial does not appear to have more frequent, longer visits, unscheduled visits triggered by primary outcome events or intervening events, or more extensive data collection.

Score: [4]

1. Primary outcome:
Quote: <span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 99.6%):

The primary purpose of this study was to determine the effectiveness of a novel computerassisted cognitive rehabilitation intervention MAPSS-MS (Memory, Attention, Problem Solving Skills in MS) in a multi-site trial with persons with MS.' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;The primary purpose of this study was to determine the effectiveness of a novel computer-assisted cognitive rehabilitation intervention MAPSS-MS (Memory, Attention, Problem Solving Skills in MS) in a multi-site trial with persons with MS.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The primary outcome of the trial is to determine the effectiveness of a cognitive rehabilitation intervention, which is relevant to participants with MS. The trial does not appear to use a surrogate, physiological outcome, central adjudication, or use assessment expertise that is not available in usual care.

Score: [5]

1. Primary analysis:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Changes in study outcomes were analyzed using intention to treat methodology, ANOVA with repeated measures, and ANCOVA.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial uses intention-to-treat analysis, which includes all available data. The trial does not appear to exclude ineligible post-randomization participants, include only completers, or those following the treatment protocol.

<pre>
1. Eligibility:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Patients (n = 84) were recruited in collaboration with six Danish regional MS clinics and The Danish MS Society. Inclusion criteria were (1) 18–60 years of age, (2) ⩽2 years since clinical diagnosis with relapsing remitting MS (RRMS) and (3) no relapses or changes in medication status 8 weeks prior to inclusion.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The inclusion criteria for this trial are relatively broad, including patients with relapsing-remitting MS who are between 18 and 60 years old and have been diagnosed within the past 2 years. The exclusion criteria are also limited, only excluding patients who have had relapses or changes in medication status within the past 8 weeks. This suggests that the trial is relatively pragmatic in its approach to participant selection.

Score: [4]

2. Recruitment:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Patients were randomized to the two study conditions by the sealed envelope principle in a 1:1 ratio stratified by line of treatment. Data from The Danish MS Registry served as a national population-based control group, in addition to the two RCT groups.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The recruitment strategy for this trial appears to be relatively pragmatic, as patients were recruited through collaboration with multiple regional MS clinics and The Danish MS Society. The use of a population-based control group from The Danish MS Registry also suggests a pragmatic approach to recruitment.

Score: [4]

3. Setting:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The study period covers 48 weeks with outcome assessment at baseline (T0), after 24 weeks (T24), and after 48 weeks (T48).&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The setting for this trial is not explicitly described in the provided text. However, the fact that the trial period is 48 weeks with multiple outcome assessments suggests that the trial is being conducted in a clinical setting. Without more information, it is difficult to determine the extent to which the trial setting is pragmatic or explanatory.

Score: [NA]

4. Organization:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The supervised exercise sessions were performed twice weekly for the full study period of 48 weeks, and was planned on the basis of four principles (adapted from Stathopoulos and Felson Duchan) 13: (1) individual tailoring, (2) application of exercise types matching the goal of the intervention, (3) progressive overload and (4) sufficient intensity to induce the desired effects of the intervention.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The organization of the intervention in this trial appears to be relatively pragmatic, as it involves supervised exercise sessions that are tailored to individual participants and designed to induce desired effects. However, the fact that the intervention is supervised and planned according to specific principles suggests that there may be some elements of an explanatory approach.

Score: [3]

5. Flexibility (delivery):
Quote: <span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 99.4%):

the exercise intervention included 3892 minutes of aerobic exercise at an average intensity of 76.2% HRmax. The exercise sessions consisted of continuous sessions lasting 30–60 minutes with an intensity of 60%–80% HRmax and interval training sessions lasting 30–60 minutes with an interval duration of 1–10 minutes and intensities varying from 65%–95% HRma' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;The exercise intervention included 3892 minutes of aerobic exercise at an average intensity of 76.2% HRmax. The exercise sessions consisted of continuous sessions lasting 30–60 minutes with an intensity of 60%–80% HRmax and interval training sessions lasting 30–60 minutes with an interval duration of 1–10 minutes and intensities varying from 65%–95% HRmax.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The flexibility of the intervention delivery in this trial appears to be relatively pragmatic, as it involves a range of exercise intensities and durations. However, the fact that the intervention is structured and involves specific exercise protocols suggests that there may be some elements of an explanatory approach.

Score: [3]

6. Flexibility (adherence):
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Patients in the supervised exercise group completed 90.0 (8.6)% of the planned sessions at an average intensity of 84.4 (3.0)% HRmax (for comparison, the planned average intensity was 76.2% HRmax).&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The flexibility of adherence to the intervention in this trial appears to be relatively pragmatic, as patients completed a high percentage of the planned exercise sessions. However, the fact that the intervention is supervised and involves specific exercise protocols suggests that there may be some elements of an explanatory approach.

Score: [3]

7. Follow-up:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;All patients were scanned using the exact same 3-Tesla MRI scanner (MAGNETOM Skyra, Siemens Medical Systems, Erlangen, Germany) at the same location, for all patients, and at all timepoints.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The follow-up intensity in this trial appears to be relatively explanatory, as all patients underwent MRI scans at specific timepoints using the same scanner. This suggests that the trial is focused on collecting detailed data on the effects of the intervention.

Score: [2]

8. Primary outcome:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The relapse rate and the global brain atrophy rate were the primary outcomes of this study.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The primary outcome of this trial is relatively pragmatic, as it focuses on clinically relevant outcomes such as relapse rate and brain atrophy. These outcomes are likely to be of importance to patients and clinicians.

Score: [5]

9. Primary analysis:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;A Poisson regression controlling for a priori defined potential confounding variables (age, gender and time since diagnosis) and expressed as an incidence-rate-ratio was applied to compare the annual relapse rate between the RCT groups.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The primary analysis in this trial appears to be relatively explanatory, as it involves statistical adjustment for potential confounding variables. This suggests that the trial is focused on identifying the specific effects of the intervention.

1. Eligibility:
   - Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Patients have been recruited at Ferrara University Hospital from patients who attend the Rehabilitation Outpatient Clinic for gait rehabilitation.&quot;</span>
   - Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The inclusion criteria were: males and females; age 18 to 70; diagnosis of MS (primary or secondary progressive, relapsing-remitting), without relapses in the preceding three months and an Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score between 4 and 5.5.&quot;</span>
   - Reasoning: The study recruited patients from a rehabilitation outpatient clinic who were seeking gait rehabilitation. The inclusion criteria are specific to patients with MS and a particular range of disability, which is similar to those who would receive this intervention in usual care. However, the exclusion criteria are not explicitly mentioned, which may suggest some level of exclusion based on factors such as compliance or response to treatment.
   - Score: [3]

2. Recruitment:
   - Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Patients have been recruited at Ferrara University Hospital from patients who attend the Rehabilitation Outpatient Clinic for gait rehabilitation.&quot;</span>
   - Reasoning: The recruitment process appears to be through usual appointments or clinic visits, as patients were recruited from an outpatient clinic. There is no mention of targeted invitation letters, advertising, or incentives, which are often used in more explanatory trials.
   - Score: [5]

3. Setting:
   - Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The Multiple Sclerosis Task-Oriented Circuit Training (MS_TOCT) trial is an assessor-blinded randomized controlled trial approved by the Ferrara Ethics Committee (registration number 140489) and registered on the ClinicalTrials.gov database (NCT02421744).&quot;</span>
   - Reasoning: The trial was conducted in a clinical setting, as it was approved by an ethics committee and registered on ClinicalTrials.gov. However, the specific setting of the trial (e.g., hospital, clinic, or community) is not explicitly mentioned.
   - Score: [NA]

4. Organization:
   - Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Treatment allocation occurred when the informed consent was obtained and baseline assessments were completed.&quot;</span>
   - Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Allocation was concealed from the outcome assessor and the investigators involved in the patients’ enrolment.&quot;</span>
   - Reasoning: The trial appears to have been well-organized, with treatment allocation concealed from the outcome assessor and investigators involved in patient enrollment. However, there is no information about the resources, provider expertise, or organization of care delivery in the intervention arm of the trial compared to usual care.
   - Score: [NA]

5. Flexibility (delivery):
   - Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The experimental group increased by 29.80 (42.55) m after Phase 1, with a further gain of 44.07 (55.35) m after Phase 2.&quot;</span>
   - Reasoning: The trial allowed for flexibility in the delivery of the intervention, as participants in the experimental group showed improvements after both Phase 1 and Phase 2. However, there is no explicit information about the flexibility in how the intervention was delivered compared to usual care.

   - Quote 2: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;In Manchester, patients who had relapsed in the previous eighteen months only were admitted to the trial.&quot;</span>
   - Reasoning: The trial includes patients who can walk with or without aids and are in an inactive phase of the disease. This is similar to the usual care setting, where patients with multiple sclerosis who can still walk and are not in an acute phase would be considered for treatment. The trial also includes patients who have relapsed in the previous 18 months, which is a common criterion in usual care.
   - Score: [4]

2. Recruitment:
   - Quote 1: <span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 98.9%):

This controlled study was started in 1963 in three citiesBelfast, Leeds, and Manchester.' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;This controlled study was started in 1963 in three cities-Belfast, Leeds, and Manchester.&quot;</span>
   - Reasoning: The trial was conducted in three cities, which suggests that recruitment was done through usual appointments or clinics. However, the full text does not provide enough information on the recruitment process to make a definitive assessment.
   - Score: [NA]

3. Setting:
   - Quote 1: <span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 99%):

separate trial was carried out in the three centres using the same treatment and scoring methods.' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;A separate trial was carried out in the three centres using the same treatment and scoring methods.&quot;</span>
   - Reasoning: The trial was conducted in three different centers, which could be similar to the usual care setting. However, the full text does not provide enough information on the specific settings to make a definitive assessment.
   - Score: [NA]

4. Organisation:
   - Quote 1: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The treated group were given corticotrophin (‘Acthar’ gel) in a dosage which varied between 15 and 25 units daily, potassium chloride orally, and a low-salt diet.&quot;</span>
   - Reasoning: The trial uses a specific dosage of corticotrophin, potassium chloride, and a low-salt diet, which may not be identical to the resources, provider expertise, and organization of care delivery in usual care. However, the full text does not provide enough information on the organization of care delivery to make a definitive assessment.
   - Score: [NA]

5. Flexibility (delivery):
   - Quote 1: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The dose of corticotrophin was adjusted to produce just enough ‘mooning’ of the face to be appreciated by the physician in charge of the trial and the dose was not increased during a relapse.&quot;</span>
   - Reasoning: The trial allows for some flexibility in the dosage of corticotrophin, which is adjusted based on the patient's response. However, the full text does not provide enough information on the flexibility in how the intervention is delivered to make a definitive assessment.
   - Score: [NA]

6. Flexibility (adherence):
   - Quote 1: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Both treated and control groups were given aneurin 100 mg by injection monthly.&quot;</span>
   - Reasoning: The trial does not appear to involve measures to improve adherence or exclude participants based on adherence. However, the full text does not provide enough information on the flexibility in how participants must adhere to the intervention to make a definitive assessment.
   - Score: [NA]

7. Follow-up:
   - Quote 1: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;All cases were seen at three-monthly intervals and scored on the Kurtzke (1961) scale; relapses lasting longer than twenty-four hours were also scored by a system in the three centres.&quot;</span>
   - Reasoning: The trial involves follow-up visits every three months, which may be more frequent than in usual care. However, the full text does not provide enough information on the intensity of measurement and follow-up to make a definitive assessment.
   - Score: [NA]

8. Primary outcome:
   - Quote 1: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;There is no evidence to suggest that the treated group do better than the controls, either from the point of view of deterioration or reduction in number or severity of relapses.&quot;</span>
   - Reasoning: The primary outcome of the trial is the prevention of deterioration and reduction in the number or severity of relapses, which is relevant to participants with multiple sclerosis.
   - Score: [5]

9. Primary analysis:
   - Quote 1: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Altogether there were 181 treated patients and 169 control patients followed up for an average period of eighteen and a half months.&quot;</span>
   - Reasoning: The trial appears to include all data in the analysis of the primary outcome, as it follows up both treated and control patients for an average period of 18.5 months. However, the full text does not provide enough information on the primary analysis to make a definitive assessment.

   - Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Follow-up was performed in the 6th and 12th week of treatment and 6, 9, and 12 months after the start of treatment.&quot;</span>

   The trial has a structured follow-up schedule, which may be more frequent than usual care. However, the intensity of measurement and follow-up is not significantly different from usual care.

   Score: [3]

8. Primary outcome:
   - Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The major results are summarized in the Tables 2 and 3 and Fig. 1.&quot;</span>

1. Eligibility:
Quote: <span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 99.6%):

Eighty-six participants were recruited from Danish MS clinics (Aarhus University Hospital, Viborg Regional Hospital, Odense University Hospital, and the MS Clinic of Southern Jutland (Kolding)). For inclusion and exclusion criteria, see LangeskovChristensen et al.' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;Eighty-six participants were recruited from Danish MS clinics (Aarhus University Hospital, Viborg Regional Hospital, Odense University Hospital, and the MS Clinic of Southern Jutland (Kolding)). For inclusion and exclusion criteria, see Langeskov-Christensen et al.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The study recruited participants from multiple MS clinics, which suggests that the participants are likely representative of the usual care population. However, the inclusion and exclusion criteria are not explicitly stated in the provided text, making it difficult to fully assess the eligibility domain.

Score: [NA]

2. Recruitment:

Score: [4]

4. Organization:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Following inclusion and baseline testing, participants were randomized (1:1) to a PAE or waitlist group using block randomization, stratified by sex. Allocation was concealed by the sealed envelope principle.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The study used block randomization and allocation concealment, which are common methods used in clinical trials. However, the text does not provide information on the resources, provider expertise, or organization of care delivery in the intervention arm, making it difficult to fully assess this domain.

Score: [NA]

5. Flexibility (delivery):

For further details on exercise modality options and the progressing volume and intensity of the exercise sessions, see Langeskov-Christensen et al.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The study used a structured exercise protocol with specific volume and intensity targets, which suggests that there may be less flexibility in the delivery of the intervention compared to usual care.

Score: [2]

6. Flexibility (adherence):
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Exercise adherence was high with 44.8 ± 2.6 completed sessions, corresponding to 93.3 ± 5.4% of the planned sessions.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The study reported high adherence to the exercise protocol, which suggests that there may be less flexibility in terms of participant adherence compared to usual care.

Score: [2]

7. Follow-up:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;At baseline (T0), after 24 (T24) and after 48 (T48) weeks, participants performed the BRB-N, the Major Depression Inventory (MDI), and a cardiorespiratory fitness test (VO2-max test). Each test session was separated by at least 48 hours from the last exercise bout.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The study used a structured follow-up schedule with specific time points and assessments, which suggests that there may be less flexibility in the follow-up compared to usual care.

Score: [2]

8. Primary outcome:
Quote: <span title='Major quote deviation, possible hallucination. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 60.1%):

Patients who switched from one iDMT to another or who had been taking a therapy other than one of the four study iDMTs prior to randomization were not included in the analysi' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;Patients who switched from one iDMT to another or who had been taking a therapy other than one of the four study iDMTs prior to randomization were not included in the analysis.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The trial includes patients who were already on injectable disease-modifying therapies (iDMTs) and were candidates for therapy change. The exclusion criteria are not overly restrictive, and patients who switched from one iDMT to another were not included in the analysis. This suggests that the trial is relatively pragmatic in its eligibility criteria.

Score: [4]

1. Recruitment:

1. Eligibility:
Quote: <span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 99.5%):

Forty-two relapsing-remitting MS patients (23 women and 19 men) volunteered to participate in the study. All participants were recruited among six MS rehabilitation centers within the region of Castilla y Le´on (Spain).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;Forty-two relapsing-remitting MS patients (23 women and 19 men) volunteered to participate in the study. All participants were recruited among six MS rehabilitation centers within the region of Castilla y León (Spain).&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The study recruited participants from MS rehabilitation centers, which suggests that the participants are similar to those who would receive the intervention in usual care. However, the study only included relapsing-remitting MS patients, which may limit the generalizability of the results to other types of MS patients.

Score: [4]

2. Recruitment:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;After a group meeting where the details of the investigation were described to the patients, including possible risks and discomfort associated to the intervention, a formal invitation to take part in the study was offered.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The study used a group meeting to recruit participants, which is a common method used in usual care. However, the study did not mention any additional recruitment efforts, such as targeted invitation letters or advertising, which suggests that the recruitment methods were similar to those used in usual care.

Score: [5]

3. Setting:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;All training sessions took place in MS rehabilitation centers and the patients were continuously supervised by physical therapists.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The study was conducted in MS rehabilitation centers, which is a setting that is similar to where the intervention would be delivered in usual care. The fact that the patients were continuously supervised by physical therapists also suggests that the setting was similar to usual care.

Score: [5]

4. Organization:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Subjects were requested to push with maximal effort during the concentric phase of the movement (90–180◦) and to lower the load (eccentric action; 180–90◦) in a controlled manner.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The study used a resistance training program that was delivered by physical therapists in MS rehabilitation centers. The fact that the participants were requested to push with maximal effort during the concentric phase of the movement and to lower the load in a controlled manner suggests that the intervention was delivered in a similar way to how it would be delivered in usual care.

Score: [5]

5. Flexibility (delivery):
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Subjects were requested to push with maximal effort during the concentric phase of the movement (90–180◦) and to lower the load (eccentric action; 180–90◦) in a controlled manner.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The study used a resistance training program that was delivered by physical therapists in MS rehabilitation centers. The fact that the participants were requested to push with maximal effort during the concentric phase of the movement and to lower the load in a controlled manner suggests that the intervention was delivered with a similar level of flexibility to how it would be delivered in usual care.

Score: [5]

6. Flexibility (adherence):
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;All participants from the EG completed more than 75% of the sessions included in the resistance training program.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The study reported that all participants from the EG completed more than 75% of the sessions included in the resistance training program, which suggests that the participants were encouraged to adhere to the intervention in a similar way to how they would be encouraged in usual care.

Score: [5]

7. Follow-up:
Quote: <span title='Minor quote deviation. Best match in fulltext (Similarity 99.5%):

All testing procedures were selected according to previous studies (De SouzaTeixeira, 2009). Regardless disability status, all the subjects involved in the study were able to perform all the tests.' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: #ffe9e2'>&quot;All testing procedures were selected according to previous studies (De Souza-Teixeira, 2009). Regardless disability status, all the subjects involved in the study were able to perform all the tests.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The study used testing procedures that were selected according to previous studies, which suggests that the follow-up methods were similar to those used in usual care. The fact that all subjects were able to perform all the tests also suggests that the follow-up methods were pragmatic.

Score: [5]

8. Primary outcome:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;The EG improved MVIC (P = 0.004), torque (P = 0.004) and average power (P < 0.001) after the resistance training period (Table 3). Furthermore, the EG presented greater MVIC (P = 0.02), torque (P = 0.025) and average power (P = 0.035) than CG after the training period.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The study used MVIC, torque, and average power as primary outcomes, which are relevant to participants with MS. The fact that the EG improved these outcomes after the resistance training period and presented greater values than the CG after the training period suggests that the primary outcomes were relevant to participants.

Score: [5]

9. Primary analysis:
Quote: <span title='Perfect quote from fulltext (Similarity 100%).' style='border-bottom: 1px dashed black; color: black; background-color: transparent'>&quot;Results are presented as mean ± standard deviation (SD). Shapiro-Wilk normality test was used to assess normal data distribution. To assess any training or detraining effect, as well as any difference between groups, MVIC, torque, average power and muscle endurance raw values were examined using two-way ANOVA with repeated measurements for group and time. Significant interactions and main effects were further analyzed using Bonferroni post-hoc comparisons. The level of significance was set at P < 0.05.&quot;</span>

Reasoning: The study used two-way ANOVA with repeated measurements for group and time to assess any training or detraining effect and any difference between groups. The study also used Bonferroni post-hoc comparisons to further analyze significant interactions and main effects. These methods suggest that the primary analysis was pragmatic.

You are an expert in clinical trial design and are tasked to assess the PRECIS-2 scores of a trial based on the full text of its publication. You have the following briefing:

# PRECIS-2 Domains
* Eligibility: To what extent are the participants in the trial similar to those who would receive this intervention if it was part of usual care? For example, score 5 for very pragmatic criteria essentially identical to those in usual care; score 1 for a very explanatory approach with lots of exclusions (e.g. those who don’t comply, respond to treatment, or are not at high risk for primary outcome, are children or elderly), or uses many selection tests not used in usual care.
* Recruitment: How much extra effort is made to recruit participants over and above what that would be used in the usual care setting to engage with patients? For example, score 5 for very pragmatic recruitment through usual appointments or clinic; score 1 for a very explanatory approach with targeted invitation letters, advertising in newspapers, radio plus incentives and other routes that would not be used in usual care.
* Setting: How different is the setting of the trial and the usual care setting? For example, score 5 for a very pragmatic choice using identical settings to usual care; score 1, for a very explanatory approach with only a single centre, or only specialised trial or academic centres.
* Organisation: How different are the resources, provider expertise and the organisation of care delivery in the intervention arm of the trial and those available in usual care? For example, score 5 for a very pragmatic choice that uses identical organisation to usual care; score 1 for a very explanatory approach if the trial increases staff levels, gives additional training, require more than usual experience or certification and increase resources.
* Flexibility (delivery): How different is the flexibility in how the intervention is delivered and the flexibility likely in usual care? For example, score 5 for a very pragmatic choice with identical flexibility to usual care; score 1 for a very explanatory approach if there is a strict protocol, monitoring and measures to improve compliance, with specific advice on allowed co-interventions and complications.
* Flexibility (adherence): How different is the flexibility in how participants must adhere to the intervention and the flexibility likely in usual care? For example, score 5 for a very pragmatic choice involving no more than usual encouragement to adhere to the intervention; score 1 for a very explanatory approach that involves exclusion based on adherence, and measures to improve adherence if found wanting. In some trials eg surgical trials where patients are being operated on or Intensive Care Unit trials where patients are being given IV drug therapy, this domain is not applicable as there is no compliance issue after consent has been given, so this score should be left blank.
* Follow-up: How different is the intensity of measurement and follow-up of participants in the trial and the likely follow-up in usual care? For example, score 5 for a very pragmatic approach with no more than usual follow up; score 1 for a very explanatory approach with more frequent, longer visits, unscheduled visits triggered by primary outcome event or intervening event, and more extensive data collection.
* Primary outcome: To what extent is the trial's primary outcome relevant to participants? For example, score 5 for a very pragmatic choice where the outcome is of obvious importance to participants; score 1 for a very explanatory approach using a surrogate, physiological outcome, central adjudication or use assessment expertise that is not available in usual care, or the outcome is measured at an earlier time than in usual care.
* Primary analysis: To what extent are all data included in the analysis of the primary outcome? For example, score 5 for a very pragmatic approach using intention to treat with all available data; score 1 for a very explanatory analysis that excludes ineligible post-randomisation participants, includes only completers or those following the treatment protocol.

For each of the 9 domains of PRECIS-2, perform the following steps:
1. Extract 1-3 relevant quotes from the full text.
2. Explain your reasoning in 1 paragraph.
3. Give a score X from 1 (very explanatory) to 5 (very pragmatic) in square brackets like this: "Score: [X]". If the full text does not contain enough information to assess a specific domain, report "Score: [NA]".

Do not provide a final summary paragraph in the end.
